        <h3 class="article_header">Wall</h3>
        <p><img src="images/osman/osman-financial-district-1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="185" /></p>
        <p>1653: City Tavern on <strong>Pearl </strong>Street becomes the first City Hall. Stuyvesant orders a protective <strong>wall</strong> to be built from river to river to keep cattle from wandering off. It then turns into a <strong>wall</strong> to protect/fortify against the British and Native Americans. But when no enemy appears, the <strong>wall</strong> falls into disrepair, the wood taken for use as firewood. With word of each new possible enemy, Stuyvesant orders the <strong>wall</strong> be re-fortified, and this is done with slave labor. Eventually the site of the <strong>wall</strong> becomes <strong>Wall</strong> St.</p>
        <p>1654: The Dutch are ousted from Brazil by Portugal. 23 Sephardic Jews from Brazil are granted asylum and land in New Amsterdam, much to Stuyvesant’s chagrin. Dutch Jews are major investors in the Dutch West India Company. </p>
        <p>1655: New Amsterdam becomes a slave trading port. The first slave ship direct from Africa arrives with three hundred Africans from Guinea. Oloff van <strong>Cortlandt </strong>is made mayor of New Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>1664: The port changes hands when the Dutch surrender it to British forces without a fight. The British rename the town New York, in honor of the king’s brother James, the Duke of York—a major shareholder in the Royal African Company, which has a monopoly on the British slave trade. After a few years of British rule, the Dutch take over again (1673), then the British take it back (1674).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>at first the wall was a palisade, a northern limit to keep the cattle from wandering off. Latin literally and figuratively, to squeeze, past participle has root which could well be the Indo-European root, perhaps with metathetic variant.</p>
        <p class="alt-line"><em>she disguises herself as a simpler person, so as to escape anyone’s notice.</em> </p>
        <p>follow the small wooden line across the perimeter, from east river to west. compare with Latin (stem, root), a wine-press, and perhaps Russian, Old Slavic to trample, Lithuanian to thrash, flog.</p>

        <p class="alt-line"><em>each bark jars her out of shallow sleep between the tree roots.</em></p>

        <p class="alt-line"><em>she was critical and now hunted.</em></p>
