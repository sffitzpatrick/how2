<div class="workingnote">
            <p> I wanted to navigate a city using writing as my map. During October 2006, I sent out a call for submissions with the goal of gathering writing about walking in cities. I specified that the writing could be about any city and take any shape or form. In addition to their writing, I asked contributors to send me a number from 1 to 92, and a direction: forward, backwards, right or left. My plan was to take all the writing I received and perform <em>Walking Poem</em> for the 1st annual <em>Chicago Calling Festival</em>. The festival showcases collaborative projects between Chicago-based artists and artists living elsewhere, in the U.S. and worldwide. Founder Daniel Godston chose Pablo Picasso’s birthday, October 25th, to be the date for the inaugural festival. I chose the <em>Chicago Picasso</em> sculpture, located in Daley Plaza, as a starting point for my <em>Walking Poem</em> navigation. 50 feet high and weighing 162 tons, it was the first major public art piece in downtown Chicago.&nbsp; Picasso refused to accept the $100,000 fee for this work, stating that he wanted to give a gift “to the people of Chicago.”</p>
            <p><em> Walking Poem</em> began at 12pm, the beginning of lunch hour. I held up a hand-written sign with “Walking Poem” printed on it, thinking of myself as a Poetry Tour Director for the day. While a mix of people assembled, I read aloud the opening piece of writing. It is the only part of <em>Walking Poem</em> that is not a submission, Gwendolyn Brooks’ commemorative poem <em>The Chicago Picasso</em>. I then read the first submission aloud. Inspired by Picasso’s gesture, I gave it away to a passing pedestrian. The interaction was fast and the woman happily took the free poem. After, I walked the suggested number of steps in the direction given to me by the contributor and repeated the process with the next submission. My limit for the number of steps was 92, as Picasso was 92 when he died. I put all the contributors’ pieces in alphabetical order by last name and before each reading wrote the number of the submission on the sidewalk in chalk. One copy, from which I read aloud, I carried on a clipboard. Another copy, to be given away, was sealed in an envelope labeled “This is for you.” </p>
            <p><em>Walking Poem</em> received 48 submissions and I added one poem of my own. Submissions came from Chicago, around the U.S., and around the world. Contributors are professional writers, students, friends, and various listserv readers. Kathleen Duffy acted as cartographer, documenting each location. It was a durational 3-hour reading of 50 texts with no breaks. We walked in circles, getting close to busy Michigan Avenue, walking near the Chicago River, and ending at 3pm in front of the original Marshall Field’s building. Daniel Mejia took photographs of the performance and people’s reactions. Some people listened and some walked away. Most people smiled and seemed to enjoy receiving a free poem from a stranger. Two older men in suits told me “I don’t like poetry” but others asked if they could come back for another free poem tomorrow.</p>

        <p>a dank hunk meets a damp hump and<br />
        jubilant they schmooze, warp apart, artfully<br />
        outstrip any gleaning eyes only to reconnoiter          <br />
        via adroit canticles, groping each others crops          <br />
        gamboling off, adducing across the sluices          <br />
        a soppy course of reciprocal limb action          </p>
          <p>          while elsewhere a route-spurned racking horse&nbsp;          <br />
          urgently performs its willed wiliness, totters at half          <br />
          stride in a quicksilver instant of cliffside bafflement          <br />
          favors the shored forefoot to hook its course          <br />
          though consequent hoovefallings find          <br />
          the poles of another felt hunger hunkering in          </p>
          <p>          amidst the peat-sweating eskers of bog ash          <br />
          it takes a couple diggers, skids its tracks, tries          <br />
          not to be fearless but recognizably seared          <br />
          nicked up and yet still leaning forward, as if          <br />
          sensation were volition itself and imagination          <br />
          not for the stinting, but sprinting rather          </p>
          <p>          until into panting speed, it oftens the thinking          <br />
          underlain and most swollen within her          <br />
          a hot minion of still belching waters          <br />
          a lateral spread, a surfeit of seeing’s clinamen          <br />
          its subjects already and inevitably exceeded          <br />
          even as in the process of being constituted          <br />
          overlapping one another as a dog laps          <br />
          slurping the agitated waters          </p>
          <p>
          galloping loose, solid as nothing and nothing solid          <br />
          as even through the shell of a chambered nautilus          <br />
          oozing occurs, an unintegrable overflow          <br />
          a mayhap slapped upon the apparent ‘round’          <br />
          following in turn and at a canter the contoured ground          <br />
          til it jackknifes, a mal-at-ease leanness compressed          <br />
          all the way to heavy breathing wrestling&nbsp;          <br />
          all the way to open struggle</p>

              Jean-Claude's House</h3>
            <p>Waking at dawn at Jean-Claude's is like waking in a conte-crayon drawing: the buildings all brown &amp; burnt sienna &amp; repeated in the cool pale-charcoal water. This NYC is as close to Europe as I'll get this year &amp; in the summer heat it feels like Rome. I sat at a sidewalk table yesterday and drank an iced espresso in a glass made for champagne or something.</p>
            <p>So now I am watching some kind of pleasure boat ply its way south toward the harbor, and hearing the gulls cry in the distance. Last night even up here on the sixteenth floor I cd hear hundreds of birds at sunset. And earlier, on Hudson Street, one raven calling for the longest time for its mate. I heard him/her first &amp; then spotted <u>high</u> on chimneys. Stayed a bit on one &amp; then moved to another spot, restless as New Yorkers. I watched a couple of them (New Yorkers, that is) hear her, but not quite register what they'd heard. Such a distinctive &amp; passionate sound!</p>
            <p>I mentally sent greetings to them, the one I could see and the missing mate, from their brethren in San Francisco, &amp; told them they did indeed still rule the world as they suspected, and everywhere kids were being wheeled home from day-care in their strollers &amp; grown-ups were stopping in their office garb to buy some kind of ready-made dinner &amp; the ravens shouted the news of space and mating, and the Dance between the two.</p>

            noticing for the first time the Joan Mirò<br />
            across from the Picasso<br />
            the scale of a hunched over elderly woman<br />
            resting at the sculpture’s stone base<br />
            and I see Icarus, not on the Rue Montparnasse<br />
            as in Jack Greene’s poem<br />
            a feather on the grate<br />
            but at the entrance of La Salle bank<br />
            across from which city hall celebrates the holiday<br />
            by spraying water the color of artificial shamrocks<br />
            from the plaza fountain,<br />
            St. Patrick’s Day years ago<br />
            when I was sullen and anemic<br />
            a girl in public school<br />
            too stubborn to wear green<br />
            the option of getting punched or kissed<br />
            still one and the same<br />
            and I walk to the Cultural Center<br />
            where a woman asks to see my id when I apply for a job<br />
            and I haven’t yet committed to living in Chicago<br />
            as my driver’s license reflects,<br />
            grown accustomed to a city <br />
            where big shoulders refers to meat packers<br />
            instead of shoulder pads or beautiful men<br />
            and outside in the plaza<br />
            children slide down the face of the Picasso</p>

          <p><em>From Stairmaster Yeats: An Epic</em></p>
          <p>Some women take <br />
            to nightwalking through strange cities. <br />
            Cities asleep, buried under <br />
            the weight of soggy covers <br />
            holding the moist breath of children drugged by summer's heat <br />
            slouching mothers smoking in doorways to catch a breath of air <br />
            snoring fathers still listening to the ballgame. <br />
            She had ferried across the lake <br />
            sailed all the way to Byzantium to meet Stairmaster. <br />
            A friend had told her they might get along. <br />
            Like her, he was a nightwalker <br />
            plus he had a thing for crazy women. <br />
            She smelled the dense steam of swampy farmlands just <br />
            beyond the city limits where deer grazed behind gas stations <br />
            if they weren't lying dead by the roadside <br />
            and a blood moon broke the surface of distant pines. <br />
            A guy who appreciated a crazed girl climbing, falling. <br />
            He whispered her name, &quot;Patsy--be the singing master of my soul&quot; <br />
            had kissed her right there on the street in the rain. <br />
            Yet she was hiding amid the cargo of a steamship <br />
            her knee-cap broken, falling to pieces. <br />
            Her little gum-chewing boy lost <br />
            she still had his picture, little things, but not him. <br />
            So she walked, nightwalked <br />
            across towns to the water's edge <br />
            sometimes jumping the barges and ferries <br />
            just to cross the empty sound. <br />
            A woman won or a woman lost--it amounted to the same thing. <br />
            Those families tucked in and sweating <br />
            under the strain of love frightened her. <br />
            She knew the violence upon the road: violence of horses. <br />
            Their steaming nostrils pulsing the cold air <br />
            beat her heart. Her skin melted and the warm <br />
            wet place between her legs ached.<br />
            The nightwalks she took with Stairmaster <br />
			improvising her music, climbing and falling <br />
			filled her. How could she fall to pieces <br />
			when walls, ceiling, baseboards and banisters<br />
			all leaned on those broken knee caps which still held up <br />
            as she scrambled eggs mornings after her furious midnight <br />
            strolls? <br />
            This was something he could never understand. <br />
            Once on her wanderings she'd found <br />
            a used bookstore still open. <br />
            Patsy had a knack for finding old volumes <br />
            with titles like <em>Ex-Wife </em>by Ursula Parrott <br />
            still jacketed by a mint green and red sketch of a <em>trés moderne </em><br />
            woman. Nobody read those books with the block lettering <br />
            back then and she would never read it either <br />
            but for a quarter she could put it on her shelf <br />
            pretend to chilled martinis, gay affairs and smooth detective <br />
			work.<br />
			All this felt new <br />
though really she remembered it from years back <br />
dry humping in the backseats of parked cars. She knew <br />
Stairmaster could never deliver. <br />
He wanted her broken, falling to pieces. <br />
She just had to move on.</p>
