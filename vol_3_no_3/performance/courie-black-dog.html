            Black dog, in this city we said would not hold us, you are holed up here in this lovely house.&nbsp; Yes, I said Lovely.&nbsp; But it is also empty.&nbsp; And cold.&nbsp; It wants a light in its middle it wants </p>
	    <ol class="listone">
            <li>familiar smells and scuffed tracks</li>
            <li>a cake cut on the counter</li>
            <li>a fly buzzing in the trash</li>
            <li>a screen open to the murmur of rain</li>
            <li>a book with a cornered page.</li>

           <div class="box1">
             <p>This house is lonely.&nbsp; <br />
               Its only joy is your music <br />
               thumping its walls <br />
             like a dazed swallow.</p>

               <em>crooked through his paw</em> </p>
           </div>
          <p>But I did say “lovely.”&nbsp; There is room to breathe.&nbsp; A whole room for nothing but breathing.&nbsp; A whole room to hold his darkness as loosely as cupped hands hold a trembling moth.</p>
          <div class="box3">

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong><br />
          Six years after I last saw him, I walk into the bar for an eight o’clock film.&nbsp; I see him (unchanged) seeing me (I want to say: changed).&nbsp; He rises as if lifted from his seat by a groin-hooked string.&nbsp; Some god more robust than time slaps my cheeks.&nbsp; I blush, a long-legged sixteen years old, (mistrustful, shy) bear his embrace briefly, slump into a booth and try to tell him what I’ve lived through.&nbsp; Feeling sixteen, I sound ridiculous.</p>

He uses it too sparingly.&nbsp; <em>Say something else.&nbsp; </em>I feel ready to bundle my self up and set its course, with him as companion, down any once-familiar road.</p>

            <p>Described by <a href="http://nytheatre.com/" target="_blank">NYTHEATRE.COM</a> as &quot;truly passionate&quot;, &quot;elliptical and poetic&quot;, and by the <em>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution</em> as a &quot;striking, enigmatic performer&quot;, <strong>Laylage Courie</strong> is a New York writer and theater-maker who uses extended voice, imaginative objects, and disciplined physicality to create space for words to work their magic--activating images immediately in an audience's imagination. Her work includes tea parties for voice and debris, dreamy cabaret, translations of films into words, and slide shows with film scores. Courie has received funding from the Axe-Houghton foundation, and most inspiringly, from unknown enthusiastic audience members. Essays on her work are published in The Magdalena Project/Odin Teatret's International Journal of Women in Theater, <em>The Open Page</em>.&nbsp; Her script <em>(stillness)</em>, a finalist receiving Honorable Mention in the <a href="http://www.athe.org/wtp/html/chambers_2008winners.html" target="_blank">2008 Jane Chambers award </a>for feminist performance text, is slated for a February 2009 reading at The Flea in New York. <a href="http://www.luminouswork.org/" target="_blank">www.luminouswork.org</a>.</p>
