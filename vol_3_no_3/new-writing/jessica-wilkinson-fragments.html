            <p><strong>Working note</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">Influenced by Susan Howe's 'poetic histories' I am fascinated by the infinite and varied capacity of poetic language to explore the past, and in particular, silenced or forgotten voices. As part of my PhD dissertation, I am writing a poetic biography on silent cinema actress Marion Davies, lover of media-tycoon William Randolph Hearst. I was drawn towards Marion to be the focus of this work because she was not only 'silenced' by the screen, but her image was 'manufactured', to a certain degree, by the powerful Hearst, who used his newspapers and money to create a Hollywood star. Their 30-year love affair never culminated in marriage - his wife Millicent would not divorce him - and as a result their relationship was not publicly acknowledged (to Marion's enduring disappointment). Furthermore, in this Hollywood setting, where much went on 'behind closed doors', there are many aspects of Marion's life that are mere speculation (such as her having a daughter with Hearst) and not confirmed.</p>
            <p align="justify">I don't believe that a simple prose biography is adequate to explore the dimensions of Marion Davies' life. It is for these reasons, and many more, that I have turn to poetic language to 'pay tribute' to this fascinating woman. I believe that the many 'possibilities' opened up by various poetic devices are potentially more capable of invoking the 'voice' of this enigmatic character.</p>
