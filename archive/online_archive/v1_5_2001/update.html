lang=EN-AU>&#34;Partly Writing&#34; is a cross-institutional event in two inter-connected 
        parts co-hosted by Dartington College of Arts (19-20 January 2002) and 
        the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Poetry at Oxford Brookes University 
        (early April 2002). Both parts are co-organised by Romana Huk, Research 
        Fellow, Centre for Modern and Contemporary Poetry (Oxford Brookes) and 
        Caroline Bergvall, Associate Fellow in Performance Writing, Centre for 
        Research in Contemporary Performance Arts (Dartington).</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-autospace:none'><span
lang=EN-AU>Description (subject to further development by participants):</span></p>
      <p style='text-autospace:none'>The main rationale for the two events of 
        talks, discussions, presentations is to bring together an international 
        group of poets, text-based practitioners, critics and arts organisations 
        to think over the question of writing for public spaces and the various 
        modes and cross-arts forms in which this takes place.  Both events aim 
        to mark out current intellectual and practical strategies, to examine 
        enquiries set up by lines of practice and to promote peer exchange in 
        environments conducive to in-depth discussions and critical exchanges.  
        At the core of these two complementary events lies the need to question 
        the effectiveness of textual interventions for the regeneration of cultural 
        spaces and poetic discourses. Although the overall format for each event 
        differs slightly, specific discussions will start from a few headings 
        to show up and push on from some of the approaches taken up by writers 
        as a response to changing communication patterns: emerging and compound 
        literacies, bilingual investment, collaborative developments, translation 
        as a practice of localisation.  The question running through these issues 
        is the extent to which innovative text practices function increasingly 
        as a complex set of negotiations (cultural, linguistic, institutional, 
        interpersonal) that both feed off and exceed specialist literary traditions 
        and test out new modes of intervening with language and written text in 
        a range of environments. This can affect perceptions around the privacy 
        of process and highlight some of the ways in which writers are contributing 
        to mixed-media strategies and ephemeral works.</p>

      <p style='text-autospace:none'>PARTLY WRITING invites participation in a 
        number of differing modes.  </p>
      <p style='text-autospace:none'>Its proceedings will issue in several stages 
        to mark the ongoing process of the work; featured readings and initial- 
        versus after-thoughts will appear on our website for all to follow, while 
        various electronic and journal selections will precede our final volume 
        of collected pieces published under Oxford Brookes&#39; developing imprint.  
        An open plenary discussion by way of follow-up is also being organized 
        for the autumn.</p>
      <p style='text-autospace:none'>The first part of the project, the seminar 
        at Dartington College of Arts, will be the smaller of the two events, 
        limiting its core participants to twenty-five and inviting ten auditors.  
        It will work from shared reading suggested by invited seminarians and 
        posted on our website; its mini-interventions (five minutes per participant) 
        will help to direct conversation generated out of the readings and will 
        be loosely configured within four working sessions.  The invited participants 
        involve an international range of poets, text-based practitioners, members 
        of arts organizations and critics; there will also be up to seven spaces 
        made available to others who might wish to apply to participate.  Auditors 
        and applying participants will be given accommodations and selected meals 
        in exchange for a seminar fee of sixty pounds made payable to Dartington 
        College of Arts.  Selections of those additional participants will depend 
        upon the relevance of their proposed interventions and history of writing 
        completed to date.  An abstract, c.v. and photocopied samples of relevant 
        past work should be sent by <b>30 September</b> to Caroline Bergvall at

        to accommodate issues and problems that arise in the seminar.  One-page

        <li>Carribean Crossings: For centuries, the Carribean has been a particular

          etc.  We invite panels or individual papers focused on border crossings 
          within the Carribean or on relations of Carribean countries with the 
          world at large.</li>
        <li>Translation issues: Both the act of translating from one language 
          to another and the act of translating fromone culture or context to 
          another are crucial to comparatists in a global context.  We invite 
          panels or individual papers focused on translations, translation theory 
          or translation as a metaphor.</li>
        <li>Diasporas: From antiquity to the present, the migration of peoples, 
          languages and literatures into new worlds has created a fertile context 
          for comparative work.  We invite panels or individual papers focused 
          on diasporas of various kinds and on how such movements affect literary 
          texts, motifs or theory.</li>

        for an incisive four-day affair in Buffalo, New York.  It looks like a 
        conference but thinks more like a festival.  It acts like a festival but 
        will be like a big brainstorm.  Our confirmed participants include Dennis 
        Cooper, Eileen Myles, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Robert Gl&ouml;k, Matthew 
        Stadler, White Collar Crime, Roberto Tejada, Ether Drag, Lawrence Braithwaite, 
        Swis Dot, and The National. SCOUT, a live compilation of writers and musicians

      <p>The object of this conference is certain forms of &#34;making,&#34; a making 
        that can concern individual poetic texts, a series of poetic texts (collections, 
        selections, anthologies&#8230;) or works that are mixed in that they use, for 
        example, non-poetic material (prose, non illustrative visual material&#8230;).  
        It works from a series of metaphors which all raise the central question 
        of fragmentation and articulation.  This double movement could be analysed 
        from a historical, genetic, metrical, or syntactic point of view, or by 
        examining the articulation of themes, or the points of those institutions 
        that construct canons, distinguish genres, and periods.  The conference 
        hopes to raise a series of aesthetic problems:</p>
      <ul type=disc>
        <li><span
     lang=EN-AU>the use, in critical texts, of technical terms from architecture, 
          painting, cinema, music, photography, and &#34;engineering&#34; (in, for example, 
          notions like &#34;play&#34; as it is used in &#34;the parts had more play than was 
          strictly necessary&#34;)</span></li>
        <li><span
     lang=EN-AU>internal procedures like repetition, irony, lay-out, &#34;pattern 
          poems,&#34; &#34;visual poetry,&#34; &#34;concrete poetry,&#34; the functioning of tropes 
          like conceit and simile, &#34;seaming,&#34; &#34;quilting,&#34; and the problem of edges 
          (frayed, masked, etc&#8230;)</span></li>
        <li><span
     lang=EN-AU>the problem of frontiers (watertight?; porous?&#8230;) between the poetic 
          text and &#34;foreign&#34; material (notes, prose, quotations in a foreign language, 
          &#34;found objects&#34;&#8230;)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span lang=EN-AU>A selection of the papers will be published in the Cahiers 
        Charles V after the conference.</span></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Where 
        is the lyric now? Always connected with the forms and rhythms of particular 
        life, as with the Greek modes of music and dance, it has survived from 
        pre-literate to literate societies (and to post-literate ones too).  Anthropologically 
        rather than historically, lyric crosses boundaries between non-literate 
        and highly literate forms of society.  One of the prime characteristics 
        of lyric is its verticality, complicated (in the last hundred years) by 
        poetry that combines lyric with other types of material.  Lyric has also 
        had to enter into dark places, and confront degradations of language and 
        ethical life. Are ways of fitting words to music, and the forms of subjectivity 
        that accompanied them, still useful models of the lyric? And, in more 
        epistemological terms, does the verticality of lyric still hold in the 
        age of electronic images? Has the &#34;inner life&#34; been invaded? Do poets 
        still write lyric? And does it speak to our necessities? </span> </font>
