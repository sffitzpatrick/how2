        the most perplexing&#151;and dogged&#151;question submitted to <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        (during my tenure as Publisher &amp; Editor 1983-1991) was often posed 
        as a demand in public forums, as if there existed a conceptualized and 
        certified answer, as if such an answer were desirable, even essential. 
        It went like this: &quot;What kind of work are you interested in publishing?&quot; 
        [Or, to read it another way: What do you approve of or disapprove of? 
        What do you like and dislike?]</font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        was, at these moments, an attempt by the gentle, determined or accusing 
        interrogator to track what <i>HOW(ever)</i> &quot;stood for&quot; aesthetically, 
        to tack down what was wanted, to determine conclusively the basis for 
        our decision to publish a particular poem/work. It continued to puzzle 
        me that the unrehearsable impact of a particular linguistic splicing on 
        the ear and eye (or the musical pressure of vagrant thought) should provoke 
        such insistent need for codification.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        was this casual assumption of a static absolute&#151;as a value&#151;that 
        led me to observe two possible phenomena making their pressure felt in 
        the world of contemporary American writing: 1) a pervasive pragmatics 
        of &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell,&quot; spawned by a national culture 
        organized around product: who is &quot;buying&quot;/choosing &amp; what 
        shape/size/color is s/he looking for, and 2) a historical but often unconscious 
        habit, perhaps more significant for women, of assuming that literary decisions 
        of consequence were set (carved?) in stone and that their follow-through&#151;in 
        publication and critical acclaim&#151;was initiated, articulated and canonized 
        by Male Editors, Critics, Anthologists. Territorial imperative. Case closed.</span>

        late as the mid-Seventies, women still occupied mid-level assistant positions 
        on the mastheads of both commercial and literary publications&#151;acknowledged 
        &quot;first readers&quot; of unsolicited manuscripts, proofers of galleys 
        and keepers of mailing lists, proliferating correspondence, etc &#8230; but 
        seldom experienced the pleasure and authority of asserting editorial choices 
        or getting credit for it.</span> </font>

        the Eighties, some things had changed. In May, 1983, when the first issue 
        of <i>HOW(ever)</i> went into the mails, &quot;women's writing&quot; had 
        been publicly identified by a group of mostly academic feminist scholar-poets 
        and editors. Their community agenda focused on:</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#x2022; 
        The creation of place: (magazine/book/essay/caucus) where women's editorial 
        choices could be asserted &amp; exercised</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#x2022; 
        The foregrounding of lesbian subjectivity/its literature</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#x2022; 
        The celebration &amp; legitimization of female body/ &quot;female language&quot; 
        as basic grounds for investigation.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#x2022; 
        &quot;common language&quot; (as in Adrienne Rich's <i>Dream of a Common 
        Language </i>&nbsp;or Judy<i> </i>Grahn's <i>The Work of a Common Woman</i>), 
        asserted as the superior agency of literary exchange... often seen as 
        the only valid way to empower a female community.</font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#x2022; 
        a growing sensitivity to class/race issues in women's lives</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
        goals helped to create an important beginning stage for a female-based 
        writing community and its claim to new publishing/editing territory. But 
        for women writers who resisted &quot;common language&quot; as a potential 
        replication of the weighty &amp; threadbare treads of the traditional 
        male prosody currently in use (and wary, as well, of prescriptive ideas 
        of &quot;women's poetry&quot;), a taking apart and putting back together 
        of<i> the poem&#151;</i>of the very writing process itself&#151;was the 
        exciting task. So much had been hoarded, silenced, pre-judged as not enough 
        or too much. Shadowing one's masters was no fun.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Common 
        language&quot; seemed too limited to hold the largesse of female-produced 
        language forms and too essentialist in what it did not express or give 
        value to . . . much like a door slamming and windows clicking shut, the 
        fortress battened down against those who didn't fit the new politically-correct 
        givens of a somewhat single-minded editorial aggregate.</font></span>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        male power structure we'd learned to recognize and analyze as the basis 
        of the canon-forming profession of literature suddenly had its able female 
        counterpart. This was not any less stifling.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        meaning of inventing <i>HOW(ever)</i> in 1983 was absolutely based in 
        the dilemma of and attunement to gender. Our hearts did not belong to 
        Daddy. We believed we could make a place for work that spoke to us and 
        surprised us, without the pressure of producing a BIG, &quot;major&quot; 
        organ. Our goal, instead, was to put together a modest-size publication 
        that adventurous readers&#151;otherwise besieged by dense work commitments 
        and familial obligations&#151;would feel compelled to read almost immediately.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        hoped that <i>HOW(ever)</i> would be a model, not just for a different 
        kind of writing but for the assertion of editorial choices by women.&nbsp; 
        We had no <i>preconceived esthetic</i> bias, except that we preferred 
        to be surprised and pulled into linguistic maps that clearly connected 
        us up to sudden locations of self knowledge &amp; recognition of intellectual/spiritual/esthetic 
        zones we might otherwise never have inhabited. We had to trust our individual 
        responses, our discretionary sense of authenticity and difficult pleasure, 
        to acknowledge variable tastes and persuasions as the work began arriving.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        made notes on our reading. Often two of us would love a particular work 
        for which a third would not feel the same enthusiasm. Part of our collective 
        process was to clarify the reasons for our choices, in writing, as an 
        attempt to convince a skeptical or less than enthusiastic colleague of 
        the necessity and value of a certain work, to ask for reconsideration 
        when there was a strong difference, to think even more closely about why 
        or how a particular piece was causing excitement in one of us and not 
        in another. We were opening up places that had been shut down by powerful 
        ideas of &#147;worth&#148; and &#147;importance,&#148; long circulating 
        through our well-schooled lives.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        never held fast to any policy of total accord, but tried more and more 
        to trust an instinct or conviction in one or another's response, when 
        that intrigue was made sufficiently clear. Through this editorial conversation 
        we educated and provoked one another to continuously widening curiosities 
        and the consciousness of learned prohibitions. Also, our chosen poets 
        helped us with each new work invented as well as with the process-oriented 
        &quot;Working Note&quot; we required with every publication of original 
        work. It was our way into the poet's thinking about the formal problems 
        she'd set for herself&#151;her methods, stimuli, and after-thoughts.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
        a parallel track with this evolving conversation was the visual esthetic 
        initiated in Vol. I, No. 2, and foregrounded in each issue thereafter, 
        with art works (usually, but not always, by women) focused on alphabets, 
        words, de-composition. Our theme or focus was never determined ahead of 
        time but always emerged from the works chosen, located in the structural 
        underpinnings of that particular converging, inscribed during a discrete 
        time frame. In this way, we avoided predictability because both language 
        and visual image were in a continual process of<span style='font-size:11.0pt;'> 
        suggesting each other. Our task was to attend.</span></font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        found that my real editorial freedom (what kept me plugging through exhaustion 
        and financial disaster), was the clearing of space for unmapped female 
        experience and formal investigation . . . writing as different in its 
        goals and its &#147;product&#148; as a painting by Nancy Spero or Elizabeth 
        Murray was from a picture by Willem DeKooning or David Salle. What we 
        were looking for was that which had not yet been uttered because forms 
        were still being imagined to contain these unsayables.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such 
        a delicate, tricky staging of vulnerability, chanciness, and resistance 
        to male editorial approval was the core meaning of our project and in 
        this sense <i>HOW(ever)'s </i>gender exclusivity made every difference. 
        We didn't have the pressure of fathers, lovers, favored male poets and 
        teachers from whom we'd learned so much. Whether we could have pulled 
        down grant money, made a bigger academic splash, produced a bigger, slicker 
        product (as one serious male poet advised us, in print, we must do) was 
        vastly beside the point.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 
        we <i>didn't </i>have to carry all that baggage and hustle&#151;inevitably 
        a part of &quot;big,&quot; officially funded projects <i>approved by committee&#151;</i>we 
        were<i> </i>free to figure out, issue by issue, what fascinated us and 
        drove us to the next focus of attention. It is probably realistic to speculate 
        that even as many male writers were extremely supportive of our undertaking, 
        had any one of them been an active voice in our collective editorial labors 
        a discretely different sum &quot;product&quot; would have emerged. There 
        would have been a more heavily weighted set of histories to stare down, 
        a male style of logic and argument with its confident and enlightened 
        pressures always there to be negotiated.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        truth, it was exhilarating to hold our collective nose and jump. Every 
        issue felt like a huge risk&#151;up to the final, two-women proofing . 
        . . and a miraculous if tentative voicing of female presence, just waiting 
        to cut loose.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        retrospect, the one problem I grappled with<b> </b>over the entire course 
        of <i>HOW(ever)'s </i>tenure was the issue of women vs. critically reflective 
        writing. My second goal for <i>HOW(ever) </i>had been to elicit a set 
        of writings from both established feminist scholars <i>and </i>working 
        poets that would elucidate a modernist and current writing practice of 
        apparently such imagined unfamiliarity in women's poetry that it seemed 
        to cause a kind of shut down mechanism in not only the male critics but 
        in the majority of women critic/scholars we looked to for &quot;readings&quot; 
        of our work. They were brave enough to puzzle through Joyce and Woolf, 
        Beckett and Ashbery, but when it came to the &quot;odd&quot; diction or 
        unfamiliar visual forms proposed by a woman poet, the silence was appalling... 
        a non-response, I might add, deeply discouraging to writers of immense 
        gifts and proven seriousness.</font></span> 
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        hoped that, given an <i>unofficial </i>venue, women poets might<b> </b>be 
        able to provide a precise and non-prefabricated description of their intentions 
        and working methods to women critic-scholars, thus enhancing a cross-fertilization 
        among the two arts/ disciplines within a &quot;safe&quot; and benevolent 
        framework, unthreatened by any real or perceived form of canonical harassment 
        or institutional bullying. I envisaged, as well, a place for informal, 
        incomplete response to current and historic works, with particular emphasis 
        on recovery of texts, letters, critical reputations of lost or dimming 
        modernist women writers.</font></span>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poets we published 
        were instantly implicated in this effort by the &quot;Working Note&quot; 
        required of each. But beyond this, it was the most difficult task to lure 
        anyone into something speculative, partial, &quot;informal,&quot; i.e. 
        not sanctioned by the fully-developed, footnoted format. I sent out a 
        large number of personal letters of friendly invitation to feminist scholars 
        and essayists whose work I discovered in my reading. We handed out flyers 
        at regional and national MLA sessions and at conferences on H.D. and E.D. 
        and V.W., inviting contributions . . . but with mostly silence in return.</font></span>

        poets were the best at taking the jump: to begin to talk about new writing 
        springing out of this quirky, unofficially recognized realm involved the 
        development of a new descriptive language. It became clear that the internalized 
        voice of a male-dominant academic method (and pleasure) of discourse was 
        a fearsome gauntlet yet to be detoured.</font></span>
