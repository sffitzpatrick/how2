style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        discussions of contemporary feminist poetry developing since the 1970s, 
        a polarized opposition between the mainstream (or content-oriented, self-expressive, 
        accessible) and the avant garde (experimental, theoretically-informed, 
        inaccessible) has become a standard strategy for mapping the current field 
        of women&#39;s poetry. This dichotomous critical strategy has itself been 
        examined recently in ways that explore the usefulness as well as the reductiveness 
        of such terms, and while my task here is not to survey these debates, 
        I do want to place my discussion of <i>HOW(ever)</i> within this ongoing 
        conversation. Although these terms are in need of close scrutiny, the 
        fact remains that such a mapping has had historic consequences and that 
        women practicing innovative linguistic strategies (for the lack of a better 
        term) have, until recently, been underrepresented in critical discussions, 
        publications, and narratives of literary history, even in feminist projects. 
        And, although these terms &#34;mainstream&#34; and &#34;avant garde&#34; are sometimes 
        crudely devisive, we need to fill out the histories that have grown up 
        around them&#8212;in part, as a way of broadening our sense of a feminist public 
        realm&#8212;before we discard them as inaccurate or problematic. The journal 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i> emerged in the early 1980s as a journal responding to 
        the experience of this division on the part of both poets and critics, 
        a journal interested in filling a perceived gap in feminist networks of 
        publication and critical discussion concerning women&#39;s experimental poetry, 
        and as a journal seeking to broaden the notion of feminist cultural work. 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i> occupies an important textual space for historicizing 
        and theorizing the public, political possibilities of an avant-garde feminist 
        practice.&nbsp; </font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ten years ago, fresh from my doctoral examinations, I 
        attended a graduate student conference on &#34;Feminism: Theory and Practice,&#34; 
        here at Rutgers University. The goal of the conference was to discuss 
        and develop possible bridges between the materiality of feminist activism 
        and the theorization of feminist scholarship&#8212;a weighty task. This opposition 
        between activism and the ivory tower, between the masses and the elite, 
        between the concrete and the abstract, is not unrelated to the aforementioned 
        dichotomy between &#34;mainstream&#34; and &#34;avant garde&#34; and the host of associations 
        attached to each term. At this conference, I attended a panel that included 
        a paper on women poets and the visual page, and the speaker (forgive my 
        poor memory) introduced us all to a journal called <i>HOW(ever)</i>, which 
        at that point had been publishing for four years. She also brought subscription 
        forms and I subscribed; I went on to write a dissertation and then a book 
        that included a chapter on the poet Kathleen Fraser, the journal&#39;s founding 
        editor. Part of what I want to talk about here today, then, began here 
        ten years ago, as I found a way to enter a reading community and to begin 
        to learn new reading strategies that expanded my notions of feminist writing, 
        that bridged for me the various modes of such writing, and that illuminated 
        for me the urgency of fostering and supporting feminist cultural work 
        in its multiple forms.&nbsp; </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The notion of a bridge needs to be stressed. As I look 
        back through the six volumes of <i>HOW(ever)</i>&#8212;the twenty-four issues 
        that span the years from 1983 to 1992&#8212;I am struck by the bridging of various 
        facets of femininst expression enacted textually, intellectually, and 
        aesthetically, and its bridging of generations of poets. I am struck by 
        the rich resource its pages provide for the understanding and study of 
        twentieth-century experimental women poets. I am struck by the way the 
        journal develops an instructional importance, teaching its readers not 
        only about current and past poets but about how to read them, how to shift 
        reading practices, how to re-examine standard practices of reading and 
        writing, re-envision expected roles of reader and poet, reconsider accepted 
        modes of discursive and material authority.&nbsp; </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>So&#8212;to the journal itself. Begun in 1983 by Kathleen Fraser, 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i> proposed to &#34;make a bridge between scholars thinking 
        about women&#39;s language issues, vis-a-vis the making of poetry, and the 
        women making those poems.&#34;(Fraser, 1.1, 1) Fraser opened the first issue 
        with these remarks, stressing the sense of displacement and isolation 
        she felt as a woman poet &#34;writing experimentally,&#34; sentiments echoed by 
        associate editor Frances Jaffer&#39;s remarks that a &#34;vehicle for experimentalist 
        poetry&#34; is needed to be &#34;read side-by-side&#34; with the feminist poetry most 
        often supported by feminist publications, to fill in a gap left by decisions 
        and practices arising from the belief that &#34;now is the time for women 
        to write understandable poetry about their own lives, and with feeling, 
        with the heretofore undeveloped self in prominent display.&#34; Jaffers articulates, 
        in this first issue, a notion of the &#34;experimental&#34; that will guide the 
        journal&#39;s development while refusing a strict or narrow definition of 
        the term:&nbsp; &#34;...the myths of a culture are embodied in its language, its 
        lexicon, its very syntactical structure. To focus attention on language 
        and to discover what can be written in other than traditional syntactical 
        or prosodic structures may give an important voice to authentic female 
        experience.&#34;(1.1, 1) In the second issue, in response to a letter from 
        Dodie Bellamy (who designed the journal&#39;s logo) expressing concern and 
        &#34;confusion over the issue of dividing women&#39;s writing into the categories 
        of avant-garde and non-avant-garde, and supporting only one side of what 
        seems to be a rather arbitrary division,&#34; Jaffer re-emphasizes the journal&#39;s 
        task: &#34;We&#39;re trying to fill a gap, not create a split...If we&#39;re successful, 
        it&#39;s possible that in the future there will be feminist magazines in which 
        experimentalist and more formally traditional writing will be published 
        together.&#34;(1.2, 15) In the final issue of <i>HOW(ever)</i>, in 1992, Jaffers 
        expresses some disappointment over the amount of impact the journal has 
        had on &#34;mainstream&#34; publications and criticism, rearticulating a desire 
        not to divide but to encourage interaction among plural feminist poetics.</span > 
        </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For such interaction to occur, however, the work of experimentalists 
        needed to be acknowledged, both as a contemporary practice and as a long-ignored 
        tradition. Such acknowledgment had not occured in the realm of the male-dominated 
        avant garde or the realm of feminist criticism and poetry. Fraser&#39;s invitation 
        to both poets and scholars to engage in dialogue about women experimentalists 
        created a space for recovery and discovery, for what Susan Gevirtz termed 
        a &#34;sanctuary in which to hone, flex, inquire, from which to venture out,&#34;(6.4, 
        14); or Rachel Blau DuPlessis described as a &#34;bridge between modernist 
        women and ourselves...a space for heterglossias, for conflictual discourses...a 
        space for a sisterhood of exploration.&#34;(6.4, 14, 14, 15) Fraser, noting 
        that <i>HOW(ever)</i>&#39;s &#34;peculiar hybrid of innovative poetry with feminist 
        critical writing&#34;(2.1, 14) limited both its potential funding, dissemination, 
        and audience, remained committed to shaping a &#34;place in which to find 
        or assert our own particular hybrids,&#34; an alternative to &#34;journals shaped 
        by various male-dominant poetics or a feminist editorship whose tastes/politics 
        did not acknowledge much of the poetry we felt to be central to our moment&#8212;the 
        continuously indefinable, often &#34;peculiar&#34; writings being pieced together 
        by women refusing the acceptable norms.&#34;(6.4, 15) True to Fraser&#39;s initial 
        vision, the journal continually addresses a number of gaps perceived in 
        the publication and discussions of experimental poetry, such as discussions 
        of this century&#39;s experimental modernist women writers; commentary on 
        the relationship between poetic structure, female experience, and feminist 
        politics; attention to contemporary women working innovatively with language; 
        and commitment to the actual publication of works by such contemporary 
        women.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>From its beginning, each issue contained discrete but 
        interactive components: creative work, author&#39;s working notes, short critical 
        commentary, editor&#39;s notes, and correspondence that sought to establish 
        women&#39;s experimental writing as a significant tradition in the twentieth 
        century and as an integral part of the contemporary poetic scene in America 
        (primarily), Canada, and England. In these pages, while a separation of 
        poetry and critical commentary seems assumed by the journal&#39;s format (the 
        placement of short critical commentary, letters, and editorial notes after 
        the &#34;creative&#34; pieces), the thematic, theoretical, and structural relationships 
        between poem, critical essay, and notes form an integral part of the journal&#39;s 
        feminist project. In the process, the textual space of <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
        both comments upon and puts into practice strategies of writing and reading 
        geared toward exploring the relationship of language structures and female 
        experience. Such exploration takes place as a process of sharing materials 
        and ideas, of teaching new concepts, of recovering forgotten ground, of 
        producing new knowledge, of producing a reading community.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>HOW(ever) remained throughout its publication a slender, 
        stapled sequence of some sixteen to twenty-five creamy, yellowish 8 by 
        11 inch pages, resembling a community newsletter more so than either an 
        academic or a literary journal. The deliberate limitation on length allowed 
        the subscription cost to remain low ($5.00 when it began), enabled publication 
        within a severely restricted budget, and, most significantly, invited 
        the reader to consume the entire issue. The physical dimensions of a given 
        issue suggest a concern that the reader actually be able to read, and 
        perhaps reread, its pages&#8212;to not be overwhelmed or overburdened. The format 
        of the journal reinforces this concern, for the constituent parts of each 
        issue are each compressed in their function, focus, and presentation. 
        At the same time, these distinct sections or parts&#8212;variously devoted to 
        poetic works, literary criticism, and correspondence&#8212;illuminate one another. 
        The simultaneous impulses of compression and interaction compel significant 
        reformulations of poetic expression and literary criticism, which I would 
        like to consider by looking at the various parts that make up the textual 
        space of each <i>HOW(ever)</i>. </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the poetry section of the journal, usually the first 
        two-thirds, various writers are presented, each receiving a couple of 
        pages. Usually a work is preceded by &#34;Working Notes,&#34; which range from 
        a poet&#39;s comments on sources and motivations for their work, to aesthetic 
        and philosophical speculations on the gendered dynamics of language and 
        form, to contextual marginalia (Susan Howe precedes a set of poems in 
        one instance with verses from scripture). These notes, usually the equivalent 
        of a paragraph, introduce the poems by giving us a contextual and critical 
        lense for reading them, often offering the reader a guide to understanding 
        the poet&#39;s process and to developing engaged reading practices. For example, 
        Daphne Marlatt describes the poem &#34;departure&#34; as part of a travel journal 
        from a trip to England, &#34;written in a series of layers, almost archeological 
        the urge to dig deeper in, to the hidden [not yet verbalized] series of 
        connections that underlay, like root systems, like bone-seeds, the obvious 
        data of our trip.&nbsp; Writing/traveling a series of intersections, two kinds 
        of speech as my Canadian tongue found its way around the remnants of my 
        British one.&#34;(2.3, 2) Or notes from Rachel Blau DuPlessis: &#34;Writing from 
        the center of, the centers of, otherness...Understanding formal marginality. 
        Marginalization. Setting the poem so there is a bringing of marginalization 
        into writing. Putting that debate right in the piece by making several 
        sayings or statements be in the same page-space.&#34;(2.3, 1) Fraser has described 
        the &#34;Working Notes&#34; as &#34;brief descriptions of the project&#39;s germination 
        and how that was translated into its formal making,&#34; evolving as a way 
        of engaging productively with the &#34;hostility,&#34; &#34;wary bafflement&#34; or &#34;resistance&#34; 
        among scholars and critics in the face of this poetry, hoping that the 
        notes will help &#34;certain of the puzzling pieces...fall into place, or, 
        at the least, alert an active curiosity.&#34;(15)</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The &#34;Working Notes,&#34; then, seek to create a public space 
        for tracing and exploring acts of reading and writing as working processes&#8212;to 
        let the seams show rather than distance the process from the product, 
        the writer from the poem. They shape reactions and readership, show choices 
        happening, build voice. Such a construct contradicts what we might expect 
        in reading a literary journal, where usually a biographical note is all 
        that might be appended, or within the still powerful legacy of New Critical 
        practices (which some might say characterize even poststructural readings), 
        approaching a poem as a hermetically sealed artifact (ie. Should the poet 
        be telling us how to read the poem?). Defying notions of poetic autonomy, 
        detachment, transcendence, and polish, these notes not only register women&#39;s 
        experiences (often relating details pertinent to the poem having to do 
        with gendered lives) but also compel unconventional modes of reading. 
        The notes interact with the poems as textual eruptions into the usually 
        silent/silenced space of the page&#8212;the space within which the issue of 
        gender&#39;s impact upon syntax, form, or word arrangements resides but is 
        not acknowledged. By including notes and acknowledging a potential textual 
        component of &#34;creative work&#34; customarily omitted, <i>HOW(ever)</i>&#39;s format 
        foregrounds the possibilities of such extra-textual material in a way 
        similar to Susan Howe&#39;s description, in a letter in the January 1989 issue, 
        of discovering in the Beinecke Library drafts of extensive notes by H.D. 
        accompanying her manuscript of <i>The Gift</i>: &#34;Most interesting [in 
        addition to gross mis-editing of the work] to me were the Notes&#8212;three 
        drafts&#8212;She did three drafts (50 pages each) of <i>notes</i>&#8212;so careful, 
        so lovely, a new way of thinking about notes&#8212;rather akin to Dickinson&#39;s 
        variant readings for me&#8212;that open the text to new possibilities&#8212;only here 
        no one even mentions there <i>were</i> (are) notes!&#34;(2.1, 15) The notion 
        of notes as variant readings is often reinforced by the fluidity with 
        which these notes (and the poems that follow) move between a kind of discursive 
        &#34;essaying&#34; and a more associative &#34;poeticizing.&#34; For example, Meredith 
        Stricker writes in introducing &#34;The Queen Bee&#34;:</span> </font> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>These pages are from a gothic romance called The Queen 
          Bee, by Edna Lee, sent to me in the mail by Daren Ganz, a painter living 
          in Seattle. We draw and paint into a series of books, glue in scraps 
          &amp; pictures to <i>find/erase</i> our text. Reading as a way of writing, 
          then. Speaking not exactly English&#8212;more like a bee hum&#8212;paint speaking 
          &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp; torn edge &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white space speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5.1, 5)&nbsp; </span> 
          </font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>On an ideological level, confounding the traditional 
        confines of something called &#34;literary criticism&#34; and its masculinist 
        assumptions and precepts, these notes insist&#8212;not that the author&#39;s reading 
        is &#34;right&#34;&#8212;but that claims to truth promulgated by notions of objectivity 
        and neutrality are skewed by their relentless dismissal of exactly what 
        these notes explore&#8212;that aesthetics, form, language usage are intimately 
        bound up in positions and constructions of gender and power.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>More overt and directed encounters with traditions of 
        literary criticism that have silenced women take place in the section 
        entitled &#34;alerts&#34;(usually including two or three short [one-half to two 
        page] essays on past or present poets), in the correspondence section 
        entitled &#34;postcards,&#34; and in the editorial notes and bibliographies that 
        end each issue.&nbsp; These sections operate to recover and introduce poets, 
        to provide bibliographical information on studies and new works, to engage 
        in dialogues, to lay out conflicts, to combat a sense of isolation, to 
        develop a community of voices. The compressed essays in &#34;alerts&#34;(usually 
        two or three that focus on women writers of the twentieth century) alter 
        categories of literary history while enacting certain reformulations of 
        the category of &#34;literary criticism.&#34; There is a certain abandonment of 
        mastery, occuring in part from the formal pressure of space, but also 
        from the effort, it seems, to develop an energetic set of conversations 
        in these pages rather than encouraging a dominant voice. &#34;alerts&#34; invites 
        the input of poets and scholars, announcing itself as &#34;informal commentary 
        and information,&#34; presented &#34;in brief letter, journal or notation form,&#34; 
        intentionally considered &#34;not complete in the scholarly sense, with the 
        hope of removing prohibitions linked with thinking/writing critically.&#34; 
        Prefiguring a contributor who in 1989 asks &#34;Can we practice criticism 
        without reproducing the...struggle for mastery,&#34;(Kerry Edwards, 5.3, 10) 
        the &#34;alerts&#34; section from its very inception is modeled in resistance 
        to such authority. Whether or not a piece is excerpted from a longer essay, 
        as some are, there is a sense of excerptedness about them, and for the 
        reader, a sense of entering the conversation midway&#8212;not in the sense of 
        then being out of the loop, as if everybody but you understands Hegel, 
        but of being swept up by voices at their highest, most impassioned pitch, 
        when finally the preliminaries are behind us and we&#39;re getting right to 
        the point, the good stuff. Just as the space of these essays is compressed, 
        so is their discursive operation, leading to essays that are like small 
        gems, full of a focused light aimed at a particular issue. They are full, 
        also, of gestures toward larger structures, like literary tradition or 
        contemporary theory or feminist epistemologies, without the need to logically 
        or systematically engage these structures, to call up all other critics 
        who one then wants to disagree with.&nbsp; </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Like the poetry that precedes them, these essays challenge 
        conventional structures through reacting to compressed space, employing 
        gesture and elision, foregoing critical mastery, creating in their rapid 
        juxtaposition a collage of essaying voices. The &#34;alerts&#34; section of this 
        &#34;peculiar hybrid&#34; allows a space to consider, acknowledge, and explore 
        language innovations by women. In doing so, at the same time that it participates 
        in the Anglo-American feminist project of literary recovery and revision, 
        so important to the 1970s and 1980s (and now), the journal records the 
        energetic interactions of American women&#39;s poetry with theories of language 
        and subjectivity entering American intellectual circles in that time period. 
        While the journal remains grounded in explorations of women&#39;s voices and 
        experiences, these very terms are questioned as poetics and theory interact, 
        as boundaries between forms and practices shift. The essays, which blur 
        into the correspondence that takes place (as dialogues, as informational, 
        as questioning) in &#34;postcards,&#34; provide in many ways a primer on feminist 
        theory, a deliberate toning down of abstraction, mastery, and power that 
        one usually associates with the authority of &#34;theory&#34;&#8212;a discussion of 
        feminist theories in ways that are understandable to a wide audience and 
        enacted in the poetry itself. In this way, theory is conjoined with poetry, 
        each making the other accessible, intelligible, or at least enter-able. 
        Fraser writes of <i>HOW(ever)</i>&#39;s concern with &#34;the structural re-invention 
        of the poem&#39;s terms, as well as the range of female experiences informed 
        by those structures,&#34; a concern that develops through commentary on Cixous 
        or Irigaray, on Marianne Moore or Mina Loy, and through the practice of 
        Susan Howe, Theresa Cha, and many others. Particularly at a time when 
        the notion of &#34;feminine writing&#34; was being advanced to talk about male 
        writers of the avant garde, <i>HOW(ever)</i> plays an important role in 
        identifying the dangers of (once again) ignoring the gendered signature&#8212;the 
        signature that the journal&#39;s format continually insists upon.&nbsp; </span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>As the journal develops over its six volumes (the last 
        volume edited by Myung Mi Kim and Meredith Stricker), submissions begin 
        to define the focus and range of the individual issues, which include 
        such areas as: boundaries; bodies &amp; knowledge; the paragraph; erasure 
        &amp; restoration; the visual page; the politics of poetic form; and textualization. 
        Increasingly, the verbal opens up to other realms, as visual works, sound 
        collagists, oral traditions, and multiethnic legacies are brought into 
        the evolving text of <i>HOW(ever)</i>. In reading the issues sequentially, 
        I noticed how often a &#34;postcard&#34; might mention a concern that is then 
        addressed an issue or two later&#8212;for example, the need to include more 
        ethnic perspectives or the need to acknowledge performance art. As the 
        journal develops, it&#8212;like the &#34;Working Notes&#34; and the essays and the poetry&#8212;chooses 
        to let the seams show, to foreground the process of editing and selecting, 
        to enlist the reader, and through these choices to work to transform ideas 
        about feminist practices and dichotomies. Taken as an interactive text, 
        <i>HOW(ever)</i> in its entirety engages the politics of process, enacting 
        &#34;text&#34; as a &#34;literary passage, that is to say, a place of transition, 
        an area which either leads to something different or a space where change 
        is occuring.&#34;(Nelly Furman, 4.1, 15)</span> </font>
