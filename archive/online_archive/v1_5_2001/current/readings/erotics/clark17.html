            the pleasure of belonging to myself, the pleasure of knowing myself 
            to be as good as I am, the pleasure of seeing myself and of pleasing 
            myself, the even sweeter pleasure of forgetting myself. Where am I 
            at this moment? What surrounds me? I do not know. I am not aware of 
            it. What am I lacking? Nothing. What do I desire? Nothing. If there 
            is a God, this is how he is, he takes pleasure in himself.</i></span></font></p>
