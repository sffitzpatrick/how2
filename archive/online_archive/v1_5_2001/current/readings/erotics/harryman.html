style='font-size:12.0pt'>My interests in stock phrases and subgenres is partly 
              related to the baffling concealments I sense within their too-obvious 
              self presentations.&nbsp; The confusion of possible responses based in 
              the desire to both understand, to change, and to leave &#34;the world&#34; 
              or &#34;the real&#34;, would be and is something that also interests me 
              in writing; thus, the goal of the writing is built on sometimes 
              contradictory or competing claims, which manifest themselves in 
              shifts of style and genre within individual texts.&nbsp; I want the claims 
              to work themselves out, transformatively.</span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>One could look at this complex of my own interests oddly 
              as a kind of model for family life or imagined society.&nbsp; Or a person.&nbsp; 
              I am interested for instance in the competing claims of erotic life, 
              knowledge and imagination with those of being a parent and the cultural 
              conditioning of what I would call &#34;white bread/bred&#34; motherhood 
              that not only de-eroticizes women who are mothers but conditions 
              itself to think of mothers as those whose imaginations are absorbed 
              only in relationship to children.&nbsp; There is then something dangerous 
              (it feels dangerous in any case) about the exploration of the erotic 
              imagination through and in writing with this &#34;maternal&#34; identity.</span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The cultural anxiety about keeping the adult eros separate 
              from the child, is not necessarily as deep or basic as the anxiety 
              over the child&#39;s witnessing the primal scene even if the two might 
              be related.&nbsp; Indeed, I would say that even this primal fear may 
              very well be patriachally induced fear, a fear about violation that 
              codes potential witnessing of the primal scene with a powerful negativity.&nbsp; 
              The fear that a mother&#39;s sexuality will dominate or control a child, 
              may be in part a projection of masculinist fancies of aggressivity.&nbsp;

style='font-size:12.0pt'>A friend of mine recently taught one of my anthologized 
              poems<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup><a name="back1"></a> to high 
              school students in her course on poetics.&nbsp; The poem, a satire of 
              Sade&#39;s <i>120 Days of Sodom</i>, probably could not have been taught 
              in a public school.&nbsp; &#34;The ventriloquist plunges his hand into her 
              ass and pulls it out screaming, minus a finger,&#34; is one of the lines 
              in the poem.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was asked to visit the class (members of which 
              are friends of my son who attends the same school) and discuss my 
              writings, I decided to read from and discuss a prose section of 
              the same piece in which I make use of Sade&#39;s <i>Philosophy in the 
              Bedroom</i>.&nbsp; I very much appreciated my friend&#39;s ability to sanction 
              writing with sexual content created by a woman in her classroom.&nbsp; 
              It is important I think to allow young people access to sophisticated 
              literature by women, including literature with sexual content.&nbsp; 
              Of course, the sophistication of the teacher, her ability to speak 
              to the students as individual readers of such a text is equally 
              important in this case.&nbsp; This is not simply about some superficial 
              notion of &#34;health,&#34; as if teaching poetry were a nutrition class.&nbsp; 
              It is about &#34;honesty&#34; and human sexuality and children&#39;s&#151;and 
              particularly teenagers&#39;&#8212;concern with honesty.&nbsp; One aspect 
              of honesty withheld from children is that concerning adult&#8212;and particularly 
              any woman&#39;s&#8212;erotic imagination.&nbsp; The withholding of this kind 
              of information from teenagers, contributes to their feelings of 
              being outcasts.</span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In my other two essays on the subject of &#34;motherhood&#34; 
              I have focused on how I learned to write while being a mother in 
              respect to the manipulation of time in writing as conditioned by 
              the lived time with a child and the world experiences that entered 
              the lived time.&nbsp; Now that my child is a teenager, those startling 
              moments, when the child&#39;s voice scissors through the enveloped time 
              of the writing-mother with a terse report or demand from his vivid 
              world, is no longer a defining event of the writing.&nbsp; His time is 
              much closer to adult time, and so another time has returned to me.&nbsp; 
              In this time, I am interested in thinking about the way my own intellectual 
              interests condition me as a artist, as they do and don&#39;t influence 
              the child, who now in may respects has his own life.</span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><i>My then seven year old son found himself flat on the 
              sidewalk in the school yard one day, as a friend seated on the small 
              of his back held his head between his hand and with a melancholy 
              repetitiveness pounded it into the cement sidewalk.&nbsp; I was the only 
              adult witness to this act, and I might not have been there at all 
              had I not arrived at school early that day for a meeting.&nbsp; As I 
              pulled the child away, my son declared in a rather affectless tone 
              that they were no longer friends.&nbsp; This event did indeed mark the 
              end of a nearly three-year-old friendship between them.&nbsp; It is not 
              one that I had the heart to encourage after my insistence that the 
              school and the parents speak to the attacking child purposefully 
              about his actions resulted in the suggestion that I had exaggerated 
              the event.&nbsp; This is not a charming story.</i></span> </font>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><i>Above and beyond the psychological fact of aggression, 
              is the way that it is understood and addressed.&nbsp; Clearly humiliation&#8212;the 
              children&#39;s, the schools, the parents, controlled the event.&nbsp; It 
              was an humiliation (underscored by fear of repercussions) born of 
              a lack of adult presence in combination with the mother&#39;s presence, 
              who, in this case, does not fit into the correct category of adult.&nbsp; 
              But I am quite confident that the humiliation&#39;the humiliation of 
              language, the suggestion of &#34;sexaggeration,&#34;s would have not been 
              passed on to me had I been the child&#39;s father.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The father 
              would have been assumed to be already suffering the humiliation 
              of his son&#39;s inability to defend himself.&nbsp; In other words, the underlying 
              question involves a subliminal cultural narrative about boys fighting, 
              and it goes something like:&nbsp; had our son picked a fight without 
              being able to defend himself?&nbsp; It is the father who is responsible 
              to the son for the narrative of attack and defense.&nbsp; Thus, the father 
              would have already been punished for his child being attacked and 
              his child&#39;s potential culpability, for in not preparing his child 
              for the fight, he shares in the child&#39;s shortcomings.&nbsp; Over and 
              over again it is their culpability in relationship to gendered narratives 
              that grant men &#34;objectivity&#34; as witnesses.&nbsp; It is a ubiquitous cultural 
              belief that women can not be objective in matters concerning their 
              children and that men can.&nbsp; And yet in some respect, the most fundamental 
              problem here was economic; the school was poor, and there was no 
              one being paid to supervise the children playing outdoors at that 
              time.&nbsp; The effects of lack of money, however, yield an emotionally 
              symbolic world of humiliation catalyzed by the presence of the mother.&nbsp; 
              Does not his power to humiliate touch on the domain of the </i>femme 
              fatale?</span> </font>

              saying because she has formed herself as a sociological entity and 
              is in conflict then with the aesthetic.&nbsp; When her writing is not

              a few questions about those things one lives in and out of books.&nbsp; 
              She is told she ought not to have a picture on her book jacket with 
              her child because it would define her negatively as an author.&nbsp; 
              She is told great women poets do not have children.&nbsp; She says fuck

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>How 
              does the mother become the mother? She is a mess. Not because of 
              anything she has done or even said. But because mothers are the 
              shadows of children in novels and in theories about the family and 
              in theories about children and because they are simultaneously the 
              corporeal, ethical, and intellectual subjects of their own universes. 
              What's odd then about living in fact and fiction or the real and 
              poetry as if these categories were truly separate? Right now the 
              mother's son is driving around with two professors: one is a philosopher 
              of history and the other is his father, a scholar and a poet. Are 
              they talking about Kant and Habermas? And categories of value that 
              must be kept separate? What happens if there has never been a positive 
              category of value assigned to the mother that can be aligned with 
              rationality /economics/aesthetics or pleasure/doing good /disinterest. 
              The mother is a mess in the universe of classifications because 
              she is not assigned a role that can represent a category of value 
              that can be kept separate. Aesthetics and ethics are not that far 
              apart. Childbirth and sexuality are not that far apart. The fatal 
              attraction of the man to her is not that far away. It is separated 
              from the child who separates from her. Thus, the mother shadows 
              the child, catalogs his activities, keeps track of his arrangements. 
              She is dressed to kill and calls him on the phone to get an account 
              of his plans for making dinner and to suggest he try the onion soup 
              with the vadallia onions. So this is the life of our dear detective. 
              When the mother and the femme fatale become the detective, what 
              is she trying to find? Who is the murderer? And when the mother 
              and the femme fatale become the detective isn't she rather like 
              all the great male noire detectives that precede her? She is a mess 
              because she is alone, responsible for something outside of herself 
              which is intimately connected to her own private nature, a small 
              fish in a big pond. But no matter how small she makes herself, her 
              shadow is too large. </i></font>
