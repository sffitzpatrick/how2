        The book of her and the foal of him without deferring to one of them. 
        To find this peculiar path and follow its constant changing. To sit alone 
        at the table. To revise a passive construction. To choose the ticking 
        body parts and the knocking poem unable to speak. To talk to it. To mother

        But he glues together parts of monsters that don&#39;t fit the cheaply printed 
        instructions. He unfolds hybrids. Nobody tells him how, his being a child

        To revise. To leave him alone. To worry. To give him a push. To book, 
        to foal, to write partial sentences. Hiding her worrying. To glue each 
        sentence together with parts of its making. To have written the sentence&#39;s 
        smooth beauty and, later, to break it apart.  </font></span>

        Sad? Maybe sometimes....but mostly we were just trying to figure out how 
        to find what we needed, being two strong individuals and such a tiny family. 
        We were in the car a lot, in the summers. I remember the red rock canyons; 
        he took pictures of the dinosaur statuary. Sacred Indian places, country 
        music on the radio, dust storms. We always had a cat or two, wherever 
        we lived. He would name them for how they looked&#8212;Gum-camel, Witchy, Watermelon. 
        And then Maynard kept coming from over the back fence and finally stayed, 
        completely devoted to him. </font></span>

        </span>He liked to wander loose in malls, I preferred friends&#39; kitchens. 
        We both liked museums and Chinese food, camping-out for awhile and then, 
        after a few nights, thick white towels and TV. Once we woke up to a bear 
        prowling in the next campsite...</font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A: 
        But it&#39;s part of how we grew up. Side by side. Looking back, I think it 
        was a pretty good model&#8212;showing him how to &#34;work,&#34; by stealing time to 
        do my own. I was close-by. That wasn&#39;t sad. What was sad was each of us 
        losing someone out of our daily lives, someone we loved and needed. One 
        way or another it happens, but ideally not so soon in a person&#39;s life. 
        But he didn&#39;t lose me and I didn&#39;t lose him. He helped me to pay close 
        attention. I learned to let him grow up. We both had our own long journeys 
        going on inside us. Whenever we hung out together&#8212;especially in the car, 
        when the motion seemed to loosen us up&#8212;we had some great talks. And laugh! 
        Sometimes I had to stop the car. But when he was drawing he was often 
        in planetary space, whereas when I was writing I was attaching myself 
        to the page as if I were driving or drawing all over it.</font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A: 
        You mean, to the writing? Everything was an obstacle. That was part of 
        the problem of trying to write <i>outside </i>of a vacuum&#8212;that is, to 
        have always imagined the poem as something that could be written <i>only 
        </i>inside perfect, uninterrupted time, an air-tight vacuum: quiet. Waiting 
        for the day when this moment would finally arrive. But everything kept 
        breaking-in on continuity; everyone wanted your attention, if you were 
        a mother. Each person imagined he or she was the only one. Apparently 
        the maternal image is in there, pulsing pure neon. You could be carrying 
        a dozen other lives inside you waiting to unfold. But it seems unavoidable, 
        this leaning towards motherlove. This wanting to be held and listened 
        to. This continuous presence of expectation. </font></span>

        I never had trouble like that. I could just sit in the front room and 
        write, with the kids playing and their friends tearing in and out.</font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A: 
        Not me. I wanted a door. I had to get completely closed off from someone 
        else&#39;s waiting and needing. It kept hovering. The phone was always ringing. 
        You wanted to be available, to be a generous person. Especially to your 
        actual child. But the milk kept running out, so it was off to Safeway 
        again, instead of to the desk. I&#39;d hear something starting up inside my 
        brain, trying to get out&#8212;even just the <i>desire </i>to think <i>anything</i>, 
        to find words for it, move them around on the page...and I&#39;d run for a 
        pen and begin but it was mostly disruption and intervention, arguments 
        and pardons, hugs and little cups of custard meant to last a few days 
        in the fridge.  </font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>                
        </span>Time kept running out. You could either stop and cook or point 
        at the refrigerator and fight the guilt. And always there was something 
        new to track down, to keep that child&#39;s mind open and flexible and muscular, 
        to honor its curiosity and persistence...(but oh, the tedium of playgrounds 
        and birthday parties...my god, the chat could drive you to the edge!). 
        I used to wince when I heard men&#8212;usually writer types&#8212;talking about &#34;the 
        abyss&#34;...as if it were an immense set of cosmic jaws lying in wait, in 
        some abstract future oblivion. Whereas, I felt that darkness hovering 
        around the corner, almost every normal day. And I <i>knew</i> what it 
        was. It was the bleakness and frustration of no time alone, no free path 
        into the forest, no access.  </font></span>

        </span>It was the problem of feeling trapped with no way out...feeling 
        one had lost one&#39;s hold on an authentic self. I mean, if a writer can&#39;t 
        find time to make notes and shape the perceptions and voices unravelling 
        inside her, she can get very crazy. Most of the time, it was just the 
        two of us and somehow that made for more interruptions than less. And 
        of course there were the problems of earning a living&#8212;dentist bills, the 
        car payment and the mortgage&#8212;thinking ahead, before sleep, about the next 
        morning, the order of what must be done to get us both to school on time: 
        his day, my day, his night, my night.</font></span>

        It&#39;s really about survival...how one stays alive to one&#39;s private art, 
        one&#39;s particular connection to being and making something new out of&#8212;okay&#8212;the 
        life you&#39;ve chosen, but also what is choosing you. How do you stay alive 
        to that? By working. Alone in your work space. If you are a writer, you 
        <i>must</i> write. To only think about it, and wish for it, without sitting 
        down to do it, is to deny your gift, to damp it down. Either way, the 
        muscle of the mind atrophies and the intimacy of one&#39;s relation to one&#39;s 
        work (the <i>pleasure</i> of doing it) diminishes proportionately. Self-diminishment 
        is painful. Poor mother, poor child&#8212;they both feel its effects. </font></span>

        </span>I <i>had</i> to find a way to write. Writing was different than 
        loving him or working for us or all the big and little shifts of fiction 
        and passing romance which kept going on above and below the life of me 
        and him and of writing. Loving and writing and earning a living were the 
        priorities. I had to find time enough for all three or I felt I would 
        not survive. Bottom line. Still, my students kept arriving for conferences. 
        Their manuscripts and mid-terms piled-up on my writing desk. The weekends 
        were entirely eaten up by being useful and resourceful. Necessity. Consolation. 
        Transportation. One day it hit me. It wasn&#39;t going to stop. There wasn&#39;t 
        going to be the perfect vacuum of silence and continuity. So I had to 
        invent another way to capture the poems&#8212;a place I could walk into and 
        back out of. Trust with a phrase or a sentence. Accretion of parts, maps 
        of disruption. </font></span>

        I had to keep my eye on things. I had to remember for two. The old idea 
        of &#34;beauty&#34; no longer served&#8212;neither the question, nor the answer. My 
        thoughts were blips and scrolls and departures. The task was to catch 
        them just as they came up to the surface. Unexpectedness, chaos, pressures 
        and breaks. Everything seemed to tilt, to barely maintain itself. In spite 
        of all effort. I thought, why not write that way? While the beautiful, 
        seamless poem stopped being relevant to my own way of working, the open 
        field of the page became more and more compelling. That mark of a seismograph 
        across an empty score.</font></span>
