What was sad was each of us         losing someone out of our daily lives, someone we loved and needed. One         way or another it happens, but ideally not so soon in a persons life.         But he didnt lose me and I didnt lose him. He helped me to pay close         attention. I learned to let him grow up. We both had our own long journeys         going on inside us.

Waiting         for the day when this moment would finally arrive. But everything kept         breaking-in on continuity; everyone wanted your attention, if you were         a mother. Each person imagined he or she was the only one. Apparently         the maternal image is in there, pulsing pure neon.

But the milk kept running out, so it was off to Safeway         again, instead of to the desk.

Whereas, I felt that darkness hovering         around the corner, almost every normal day. And I <i>knew</i> what it         was.

And         of course there were the problems of earning a livingdentist bills, the         car payment and the mortgagethinking ahead, before sleep, about the next         morning, the order of what must be done to get us both to school on time:         his day, my day, his night, my night.</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>                        </span>Meanwhile, art supplies, guitar strings, Star Trek uniform...only         one certain color and fabric would do.

How do you stay alive         to that? By working. Alone in your work space. If you are a writer, you         <i>must</i> write. To only think about it, and wish for it, without sitting         down to do it, is to deny your gift, to damp it down. Either way, the         muscle of the mind atrophies and the intimacy of ones relation to ones         work (the <i>pleasure</i> of doing it) diminishes proportionately.

Writing was different than         loving him or working for us or all the big and little shifts of fiction         and passing romance which kept going on above and below the life of me         and him and of writing. Loving and writing and earning a living were the         priorities. I had to find time enough for all three or I felt I would         not survive. Bottom line. Still, my students kept arriving for conferences.         Their manuscripts and mid-terms piled-up on my writing desk. The weekends         were entirely eaten up by being useful and resourceful. Necessity. Consolation.         Transportation. One day it hit me. It wasnt going to stop. There wasnt         going to be the perfect vacuum of silence and continuity. So I had to         invent another way to capture the poemsa place I could walk into and         back out of. Trust with a phrase or a sentence. Accretion of parts, maps         of disruption. </font></span>       <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">B:         But what about beauty and form?</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A:         Beauty, as Id been taught to think of it, no longer interested me in         the same way.  </font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">B:         I really dont see...</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A:         ...how you can write a poem without it, right?</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">B:         Right.</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A:         I had to keep my eye on things.

The task was to catch         them just as they came up to the surface. Unexpectedness, chaos, pressures         and breaks. Everything seemed to tilt, to barely maintain itself. In spite         of all effort. I thought, why not write that way? While the beautiful,         seamless poem stopped being relevant to my own way of working, the open         field of the page became more and more compelling.
