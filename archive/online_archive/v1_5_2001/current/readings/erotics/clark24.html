METAPHOR: Woe to you who first dissed metaphor in my           hearing! that <i>move across what</i> is a delirium of destabilization           that feels like an abandonment inherent in language. I want to let the           beauty of its doomed effort show. What are you afraid of? Its thrownness           is yours. If &#147;we&#148; live <i>like</i> and <i>as</i> whatever           whatever, <i>that's </i>toxic; leave metaphor out of it. </span></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line'>A syntax, e.g. of adoration, might largely extremely deny           cause and effect. Instead there is faked tautology [metaphor], restlessness,           the reflexive. It may feel like destruction (of language) (of thought)           until you realize that language (thought) is what is driving it. &#147;It&#148;           being whether presence or absence will prevail. </span></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line'>Metaphor, <i>glorying</i> in its own clumsiness.

TITLING: Depending anything from anything is a device           of thinking; what depends from words without context is understood as           their context. This is very strange. It's just a habit of course. It           came from ways of making humans responsible for &quot;their&quot; pasts           (when they went to V*** at the extreme north end of the island, and           the cop asked all the women their names, the first fifty said, Woman;           after a long while, he got it) and comes from metaphor's use in taxonomy.           Content is possession; and possession is more than nine-tenths of epistemological           law. What is contained is possessed by what contains it. Sometimes what           is uncontained [abject] is unrecognizable [stateless]. The &quot;constituitive           inside.&quot; If the outside is ripe and the inside unknown, a title           is a guess, an attractant, strangely unpromiscuous. The text walks.           The title hovers. It's <i>outside</i>.</span></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line'>3.

BULK INCAPACITATING UNDERSTANDING: what is too much           to hold in the mind is what ruptures the mind-that-holds. To make this           show in language is all I want to do. Here is a description of the archangel           Gabriel from the Muslim tradition : &quot;He has 1600 wings, with saffron           colored hairs (bright yellow gold), from head to foot, a sun between           his eyes, each hair containing a separate sun and moon, and he enters           the Sea of Light 370 times in one day and a million drops fall from           each wing and from each drop God creates an angel in the form of Gabriel           that glorifies God until the Day of Rising.&quot; ...</span></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line'>6.

The faux-rigorous, relentless, structuring devices &#151;           nesting, indices, supplements, footnotes, tables of contents, cross-reference           &#151; are to counter the fact that every successful page or poem self-annihilates.           They're the corpse of it. And I'm sorry but I think that all the earnest           <i>apparatus </i> is just funny and a bit frightening. Like someone           else's sex toys.
