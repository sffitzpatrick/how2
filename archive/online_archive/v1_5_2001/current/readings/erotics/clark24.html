layout-grid-mode:line'>1. METAPHOR: Woe to you who first dissed metaphor in my 
          hearing! that <i>move across what</i> is a delirium of destabilization 
          that feels like an abandonment inherent in language. I want to let the 
          beauty of its doomed effort show. What are you afraid of? Its thrownness 
          is yours. If &#147;we&#148; live <i>like</i> and <i>as</i> whatever 
          whatever, <i>that's </i>toxic; leave metaphor out of it. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>A syntax, e.g. of adoration, might largely extremely deny 
          cause and effect. Instead there is faked tautology [metaphor], restlessness, 
          the reflexive. It may feel like destruction (of language) (of thought) 
          until you realize that language (thought) is what is driving it. &#147;It&#148; 
          being whether presence or absence will prevail. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>Metaphor, <i>glorying</i> in its own clumsiness. Its own 
          clumsy toss across the chasm, its unworthiness, trad. squire, tells 
          it as proof of the <i>glory</i> &#151; nb &#151; of the object it addresses

layout-grid-mode:line'>2. TITLING: Depending anything from anything is a device 
          of thinking; what depends from words without context is understood as 
          their context. This is very strange. It's just a habit of course. It 
          came from ways of making humans responsible for &quot;their&quot; pasts 
          (when they went to V*** at the extreme north end of the island, and 
          the cop asked all the women their names, the first fifty said, Woman; 
          after a long while, he got it) and comes from metaphor's use in taxonomy. 
          Content is possession; and possession is more than nine-tenths of epistemological 
          law. What is contained is possessed by what contains it. Sometimes what 
          is uncontained [abject] is unrecognizable [stateless]. The &quot;constituitive 
          inside.&quot; If the outside is ripe and the inside unknown, a title 
          is a guess, an attractant, strangely unpromiscuous. The text walks. 
          The title hovers. It's <i>outside</i>.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>3. Repetition, to release the strangeness as much as welcome. 
          The adorers' characteristic repetition of you &#151;</span> You You 
          You You You You You You You You &quot;because a ten-fold repetition 
          is wont to please <img src="../32.gif" width="23" height="20" border="0" alt="note 32" onMouseDown="MM_openBrWindow('note32.html','note32','width=200,height=125')">&quot;

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>4. When there is &quot;no place,&quot; anyone bursts into 
          place hysterically. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>5. BULK INCAPACITATING UNDERSTANDING: what is too much 
          to hold in the mind is what ruptures the mind-that-holds. To make this 
          show in language is all I want to do. Here is a description of the archangel 
          Gabriel from the Muslim tradition : &quot;He has 1600 wings, with saffron 
          colored hairs (bright yellow gold), from head to foot, a sun between 
          his eyes, each hair containing a separate sun and moon, and he enters 
          the Sea of Light 370 times in one day and a million drops fall from 
          each wing and from each drop God creates an angel in the form of Gabriel 
          that glorifies God until the Day of Rising.&quot; ...</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>6. Endless interruption, another enterprise of syntax, 
          ditto. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>7. The faux-rigorous, relentless, structuring devices &#151; 
          nesting, indices, supplements, footnotes, tables of contents, cross-reference 
          &#151; are to counter the fact that every successful page or poem self-annihilates. 
          They're the corpse of it. And I'm sorry but I think that all the earnest 
          <i>apparatus </i> is just funny and a bit frightening. Like someone 
          else's sex toys. Evolution?</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'>8. BIO: Eden: nouns in crisis: first verb: <i>to receive</i>. 
          This blowsy nothing &#151; &quot;my book&quot; &#151; a result. The 
          agglomerative, endless, bulgy, insultingly, needlessly big, an actually 
          [word count] tiny book, made and unmade as fast. Made to be <i>for</i> 
          &quot;everything&quot; but not a container, much gooeyer than that. 
          And, I offer Jean-Francois Lyotard a little machine that does, or may, 
          suffer from the burden of its memory, as he wished. </span></font></p>
