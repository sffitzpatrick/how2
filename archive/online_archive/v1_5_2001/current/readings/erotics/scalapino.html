        as structure of the book, the second being a single day as the structure/process

        event, every motion, every transition of his or her own mind, &amp; could 
        perform this process of translation on himself, using the code, for a

style='font-size:12.0pt'>She may mean transcription of every event, every motion,

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be no lineage 
        in order to see what the mind is. That&#39;s just a construct, also. As lineage

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the relation 
        of one&#39;s mind to people&#39;s behavior (including one&#39;s own). Writing is itself

        is fact/action/events, and also characteristics and repetition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If writing is viewed

        of true or inherent existence within phenomena. In the alternative linguistic 
        formulation, however, emptiness is characterized as the fact that the 
        referent labeled by a term is not found when searched for by an analysis 
        that examines the ultimate nature of the object. As a corollary...nothing

        a stream (in a series of epiphanies, as if anthologizing or it has the 
        same effect as anthologizing). The form of the fabric of allusions seems 
        thus to transcribe &#39;them,&#39; the people. And the substance and connections

        writing) of the referenced person. Thus while apparently submissive, the 
        fabric of allusions is a hidden narrative.</span> <br>
        <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 
        academic format assigns lineage and describes a poet&#39;s body of work <i>in</i> 
        relation to that prior manifestation or example. It is as if history or 
        thought is hierarchical and a poet&#39;s work is only seen in that hierarchy. 
        What occurs as the shape/motion or sound that is the language is not in 
        the description or seen to be there, only the writing&#39;s relation to other 
        things&#8212;that is, the background and its connections to the present are 
        not assessed, rather the background is simply reified. In that way, background

        be said to have is a very weak, conventional one that is reflected in 
        the patterns of interconnection, that is, in the usage of language. What 
        emerges is a picture of a world of elements in free fall. Because they 
        all fall at the same rate, however, there is the appearance of solidity;
