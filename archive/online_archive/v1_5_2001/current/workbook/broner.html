          How does a work partly about the bearing of pain elicit such pleasure? 
          Your close, close attention to language is certainly part of it.You have 
          been able to speak of unspeakable physical pain and yet the reader does 
          not flinch away, but rather is educated. In reading “2. Much that I don't 
          remember,” the letter “O” is capped repeatedly and you speak about “a 
          decreasing capacity/to find wORDs.” “O”s keep breaking through the words’ 
          construction. I read it as a calling out—Oh!—interrupting your thoughts, 
          as pain does. You seem to be tracking your perception of pain and speak 
          of the loss of language. Also, in  “3. The Nerves like Tombs,” you write: 
          “As if an island under fog, memory's/outline blurs in fall and disappears/in 
          spring.” Could you say something about the loss of language in relation 
          to experiencing pain—the present tense of it (you speak of “present perfect,” 
          in no. 11); the relation of language to memory, and the tracking of language’s 
          loss through language itself?</font></span> 
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>CH</b>: 
          Much of the poem is taken from the journal I kept during that time. Because 
          I had trouble writing and concentrating for about a year from neurological 
          impairment, I used the journal to track the disease’s progress—literally 
          to track the loss of language IN language. So I had a record of cognitive 
          and linguistic loss, and for a writer, this is an incredible experience. 
          The typographical experiments in some of the sections—like the recurring 
          “O”s and other words and sounds, morphemes (which I thought of as Virginia 
          Woolf’s “ords, scraps, fragments” from <i>Between the Acts</i>, written 
          just before the suicide that she described in her journal as “the one 
          experience I will not write about”) nested in the longer words—began to 
          emerge first as lament, and then as discovery. </span> </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I 
          began slowly, hesitatingly, to work on the poem as my cognitive capacities 
          returned. The actual experience happened five years ago, and the process 
          of writing the poem, which is the process of writing through the disturbing 
          isolation that disease produces, has taken all these five years to make 
          a kind of sense of. As one’s identity disappears into disease (I was “nobody” 
          even as, when physical pain was at its height, I was also not “no body” 
          but something more like “only body”), one becomes impossibly aware of 
          the world’s bodies-in-pain, about which one can DO nothing. One realizes 
          that very quickly, one comes to—if not identify, then—empathize: what 
          I’ve come to think of as a capacity to feel with, not feel for (as in 
          sympathy) others. But one can do nothing for others, but, perhaps, listen 
          from that awakening consciousness to others whom one knows or meets. So, 
          in other words, very little. Or nothing. It all becomes a kind of spiritual 
          process as well as poetic process one goes through.</span> </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The 
          experience of this particular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, was, as I 
          have said, in the present perfect—a perfect presence and present (in both 
          senses of the word), a constant, of physical pain. Physical (and of course 
          intense mental) pain is—or perhaps I should say <i>feels</i> like—an infinity. 
          It is so present, so inescapable, that one can no longer remember what 
          life was like before the pain began or imagine life resuming without it 
          in the future. One is contained by the physical sensation of pain, which 
          is indescribable, unsharable, as Elaine Scarry has written in <i>The Body 
          in Pain</i>. There is that central irony in the poem: that the tense one 
          uses to convey that sense is the present <i>perfect</i> (as if the condition 
          were perfect), that the poem is “about”—attempts to track in language—something 
          that is beyond language and in fact, has taken language away. So both 
          like memory (because the experience itself was beyond language) and as 
          memory (because the experience is now in the past perfect of “was having 
          pain”), the experience of disease is a reconstruction in and through language. 
          Why do that?, I guess has been my question over the years.</span> </font>

          I’d like go back for a moment to the morphemes. I was moved by words that 
          had embedded in them (in bed with them) other meanings or their opposites, 
          serious-minded puns. “Take it, beLIEve that it’s/not in your control.” 
          (from “4, Green surrounds the mind of summer). The word “lie,” lying within 
          “belief,” parallels how one feels the body has betrayed. (Is illness a 
          lie the body believes or is health?) Later, “de-/tachMEnt from ambI-/shuns—wORld-…”(from 
          “8. Since I cannot think”) I did not expect to find “ME” in detachment, 
          though “I” is at home in ambition, and while ambition butts into the world, 
          it doesn’t shun the world. And later in that section, you write “tendering 
          the tENDer/pARTs.” The word “end” opposes “tender” and also evokes “art’s 
          end.” Or, “not my wILL” that ill should be part of will and “here” part 
          of “there,” and “all” in “small.” I somehow feel the truth most in these 
          kinds of opposites, just as death plays counterpoint to life. Or language’s 
          needle pokes through experience to create some kind of garment.</span> 
          </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>CH</b>: 
          These words-within-words began, as I recall, first as lament—perhaps a 
          bit as prayer or invocation, in that tradition (the “OM”s that form part 
          of pattern). I started by emphasizing the “O’s” because I wanted a sort 
          of long, low undertone to be raised to the level of consciousness, through 
          a cumulative visual effect. But then I began to discover little words 
          within words that supplemented the linear meaning, and created a tension 
          within it. That tension of the shattered “I” that I was exploring thematically 
          and, at the level of the text, typographically and spatially.  </span> 
          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>That 
          strain of “opposites” you note wasn’t really conscious at all. Well, yes, 
          the irony of the “ME” straining against an experience of inexorable detachment 
          from a unified sense of self (Me being the objective case), the “I” in 
          “ambition” (subjective). But the “lie” one discovers, as one threads one’s 
          way through the medical establishment, is that there’s no mind/body relationship, 
          as Kathy Acker has written about in “The Gift of Disease.” The quotation 
          from <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> about the body caging the soul is precisely 
          descriptive of the experience of illness. So the text oscillates between 
          awarenesses.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>SB</b>: 
          In “7. The Hour of Lead,” I read a soft, short breath in the lineation 
          that embodies illness or pain. In a note from Kathleen Fraser, regarding 
          “The Incognito Body,” she asks “What has changed (if anything) in your 
          pleasure in/understanding of the poem’s “making”—its possibilities—during 
          this lengthy (5 years) revision process, i.e. what has shifted in your 
          structuring of the poem/the line as you worked to uncover or take apart 
          this difficult subject, issues of ‘personal lyric’ vs. distancing devices, 
          etc.” I realize you have spoken to this in part, but I wonder if you describe 
          the line of movement from one kind of poetry into another. Perhaps related 
          is fluctuating rhythm between a kind of lyrical prose/rhythm/reference 
          and the investigative gesture of the morphemes—a magnifying glass held 
          to a word.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>CH</b>: 
          At first, I had the experience of ‘disappearing’—being a no-longer-self, 
          and the lines and spaces around the morphemes, words, and lines tried 
          to track the hesitancy, the long silences around, thoughts and spoken 
          words. Then, as the poem began to take shape, I experimented with collaging 
          in other ‘languages’—of medical anthropology, for example, which I eventually 
          came upon framing (as the self is “framed” by examination, as well as 
          by the identity of having a disease). I had been fascinated with the way 
          Marianne Moore, for example, uses unpoetic language—languages from many 
          sources (advertisements, guidebooks, prose studies of all sorts like magazine 
          articles and Biblical exegesis)—to create the texture of her poems. It 
          has always seemed to me to argue against Bakhtin’s writing off poetry 
          as monological (unlike novels)—that the layering of languages (what he 
          calls heteroglossia) is not just found in the novel, but also in modern 
          and postmodern poetry (it’s so obviously there in performance art, for 
          example). So in the beginning, of necessity to some extent, I was structuring 
          the poem through collage and pastiche, playing with the buried linguistic 
          puns and the spatial arrangements to interrupt and disrupt what was, after 
          all, a very straightforward description of personal trauma. </span></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 
          the last year or so, as I wrote the final sections, my sense of self had 
          literally re-coalesced, and so had the poem’s sections, formally. At this 
          point, the poem emerged more clearly to me as an arena of possibility 
          as well as limitation. The sections that most literally describe physical 
          pain are “contained” within the sonnet form (conventionally a “little 
          song” about love and very asymmetrically gendered). The style of the personal 
          lyric is perhaps most evident in section 9, “Body Scans,” but there the 
          voice is in the second person “you”—both to convey the sense of self as 
          observed and to evoke a kind of identifying activity within the reader. 
          Both sonnets allude to and even quote directly from one of Dickinson’s 
          poems about pain, so at moments in the poem that are most autobiographical, 
          another voice enters in. The sonnet you mention, “The Hour of Lead,” also 
          uses repetition a lot (“dream” is repeated three times, for example)—and 
          the sounds themselves are not so much rhymed as repeated—to suggest a 
          paucity of language, its loss, that stumbling.  </span> </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I 
          had also become interested in the possibilities of abstract language as 
          a component of the poem and the linguistic experimentation with language 
          in the poem. So in the last sections, though in conventional stanzaic 
          forms, the language is actually very abstract—a kind of epistemological 
          and ontological inquiry.  </span></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>About 
          the poem’s structure and rhythms, I can only say that they emerged intuitively, 
          through trial and error, except of course in the sonnets. I’ve disrupted 
          the narrative chronology, although it’s there, embedded in the arrangement 
          of the sections. There’s a lot of interruption (even in the sonnets, by 
          parenthetical lines and phrases)—of one language by another, of one style 
          by another, of words by space, and within words by typographical shifts. 
          One could say that such interruption is a structural principle, a signifying 
          on “normal” life being interrupted by some trauma, like an illness, and 
          on the memorializing, conceptualizing processes of the mind being interrupted 
          by incapacitation, forgetting.</span> </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The 
          changes in the writing over the years that this poem took shape have to 
          do with the aesthetic pleasures of shaping a series tracking something 
          that happened “to” me, which I survived well and luckily, rather than 
          one that I conceived of as a planned project (like saying “for my next 
          project, I’m working on…”). My relationship to language, even to poetry, 
          as well as to self had changed. I returned to the poem and its ideas as 
          to an originary scene. The poem then unfolds with the urgency of a repetition 
          compulsion, a reconstruction around a memory (which now seems more like 
          dream) of trauma. In its seeking to find a language that could approximate 
          lived experience, it was more ecstatic (out of the body) or revisionary, 
          though, than pleasurable in the writing.  </span></font>
