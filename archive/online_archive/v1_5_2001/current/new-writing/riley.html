        three texts included here are all part of Riley&#146;s <i>Selected Poems.</i> 
        &#145;A shortened set&#146; (originally from <i>Mop Mop Georgette)</i> 
        adapts a line from a traditional song from Nigeria, and repeats one Stevie 
        Winwood phrase and a Lewley Gore line from &#145;It&#146;s My Party&#146; 
        written by W. Gold, J. Gluck Jr, and H. Wiener. The paintings referred 
        to in &#145;A shortened set&#146; are by Ian McKeever. &#145;Wherever 
        you are, be somewhere else&#146; <i>(Mop Mop Georgette)</i> is a title 
        based on the Nintendo Game Boy slogan; the italicised phrases in the poem 
        are adapted from the old Chyavash, from the play <i>The Peach Blossom 
        Faz</i> by K&#146;ung Shang-jen, and from the ballads &#145;Fair Annie 
        of Lochryan&#146; and &#145;Sweet Willia and fair Annie&#146; in Alexander 
        Gardner&#146;s <i>The Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland</i>, 1893 &#151;also 
        a source of the lines italicised in &#145;Knowing the real World&#146;. 
        The title of &#145;Outside from the Start&#146; is from Merleau-Ponty, 
        <i>The Phenomenology of Perception:</i> &#145;Nothing determines me from 
        outside, not because nothing acts upon me, but on the contrary because 
        I am from the start outside myself and open to the world&#146;</font></span>
