        <i>In Situ</i> while working in a State Park as a naturalist or as the 
        Park Service calls it: an interpreter. Interpreting what, I don&#39;t know, 
        the mysteries of the environment, the foreign tongue of tree, creek, deer. 
        I was also asked to present living histories, narratives drawn from the 
        lives of those who lived within the territory of the park. I was given 
        stories about Italian and Spanish explorers, Russian cartographers, Irish 
        immigrants. I was told no native people lived in the area, passing through 
        only occasionally, gathering berries on the way to the sea. At the end 
        of the season, a mortar was &#34;discovered&#34; on a slope of rock. Clearly, 
        they said, an indication of enduring native presence. And what of the 
        other stories, other lives, the Chinese farmers, the Californios, the 
        slaves and free blacks, the Miwok, Yurok, Ohlone people who were enslaved 
        after California became a state and before the Emancipation Proclamation 
        made this practice illegal. The list is endless and I staggered under 
        its weight. I read and wrote and unearthed myself, another object, its 
        inquiry.</font></span>
