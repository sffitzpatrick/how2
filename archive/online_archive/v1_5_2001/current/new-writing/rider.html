        the narrative, precedes and follows her own birth. The whole body has 
        the same tone, thus no ellipsis, no separate commentaries or asterisks.)

      be. I could not ask for more. But the best green-found girl is gone behind

        A warrior must prepare for battle even on her deathbed, my mother used 
        to say. Though when they came, she looked up from her bones and with one
