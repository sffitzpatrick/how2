              I sit down to write, November 25, 2000, I&#39;m beset by a swarming
              myriad of diffuse exuberances, agitations, desires, dreads and erotic
              terrors, the paralysis I once saw in a hare being chased by a fox
              on the median strip of an airport runway&#8212;I was seated in the plane
              coursing down the runway watching the predatory drama which took
              place in a faint wash of fresh December snow. The enormous hare
              froze in place and the fox was bearing down fast but as the plane
              took off the din and chaotic air disoriented the fox so much that
              it ran right past the now-statued hare and trotted out onto the
              runway ... &nbsp;I&#39;m always both fox and hare&#8212;disoriented, paralyzed,
              acting, reacting, freezing or blindly continuing right past my putative
              goal to produce some unexpected result.</font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I
              had no idea, for example, that when I sat down to write &#34;when I
              sit down to write&#34; I&#39;d end up writing the fox-on-the-runway memory,
              which is less than ten years old. I thought I&#39;d write about old
              ghosts and older desires, and I&#39;m sure that about a hundred or so
              words into this runway I will.</font></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It
              strikes me as noteworthy that I&#39;ve continually imagined the description
              of this exercise as beginning &#34;when you sit down to write&#34; and just
              this morning&#8212;November 25, 2000, after a Thanksgiving in which I
              was truly grateful to be alive&#8212;more details may follow&#8212;just this
              morning as I printed out Nada&#39;s description-cum-urgent-appeal I
              realize it does <i>not</i> say &#34;when you sit down to write&#34; but
              rather &#34;during the act of writing...&#34; To what can I attribute this
              persistent misprision on my part other than the intrusion of that
              anxiety that makes the gearing-up for sitting-down more of an anticipatory
              preoccupation than the actual &#34;writing itself&#34; whatever that is?
              It&#39;s the swarm of ghosts called Mourning, Melancholia, Rage, Perfectionism,
              Prozac (cognitive impairment), Tug, Undertow to which I&#39;m losing
              my train; there&#39;s a brain drain in my think tank. </font></span></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All
              the drama takes place before I &#34;sit down to write,&#34; before I&#39;m in
              the duration of the act of writing. But all of this is only provisionally
              true&#8212;some months ago I would have responded differently, I would
              have said the whole thing was torture, that I&#39;m lucky to put in
              a sentence a day sometimes when I&#39;m working on certain critical
              projects. My so-called book for example. At the mention of it my
              thoughts scatter like buckshot like a flock of gamebirds startled
              by the shot, I can&#39;t follow a line of flightwords to any logical
              terminus and my heart flutters with restless irritability in the
              face of my frenzied inarticulateness. There, now this really is
              torture, I can&#39;t bear to write those ideas that mean so much to
              me&#8212;the celebration and analysis of quaint &#34;&eacute;criture brute&#34; which
              others find contemptibly mediocre, immersed in prefab sentiment,
              etc.&#8212;newspaper verse, poetry written for funerals by orphaned children&#8212;real
              tearjerkers that make my avant-garde pals puke, cringe and wince,
              and that outrage my craft-oriented poet friends. How can I &#34;explain&#34;
              &#34;myself&#34; or my &#34;project&#34; how can I slow this frantic brain-pulse
              down sufficiently to present the proper context whereby the beautiful
              fragments of raw words that I tend and cherish can be palatably
              processed by the &#34;real writers,&#34; &#34;real critics,&#34; etc. The frustration
              becomes embodied in my windpipe&#8212;it&#39;s the body of my father, who
              turned gold and leaf-like in his last days almost thirty years ago
              and then on his death his fragile body folded into a fetal ball
              and moved wholesale into mine, cutting off my larynx right at throat
              level (redundant?)&#8212;he got between me and me, I couldn't talk through
              him. What if he dissolves and I lose him, at what cost do I write,
              claim myself unambiguously as a writer? And then there&#39;s the sweet
              on-the-verge-of boyfriend I repudiated harshly three days after
              my father died, who later turned out to be a murderer, at what cost
              do I reclaim that adolescent eroticism in all its enormity? This
              confession is spilling out clumsily, hurriedly, and I&#39;m not &#34;connecting&#34;
              with it, possibly because it corresponds too closely to what I thought
              I was spozed to write, what I see as the psychological underpinnings
              of a lifelong &#34;writer&#146;s block.&#34; Interesting that I read Nada&#146;s
              description as an invitation to confession. &#34;You&#39;re so unambiguously
              a poet,&#34; my college friends would say, &#34;so absolutely a writer,
              but you don&#39;t write!&#34; And two decades later when I meet the langpos
              in Louisville, Charles B asks, &#34;Do you write poetry? I know you
              write criticism <i>poetically</i>, but do you write poetry?&#34; Noyesnoyesno,
              I try not to think in those genre-divisive terms, but of course
              I&#39;ve internalized them ho-hum. </font></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So&#8212;when
              I sat down to write today, Novmber 27, 2000, at the caf&eacute;, a former
              student came up and introduced himself, said he was taking classes
              from Lucie Brock-Broido and Carolyn Forch&eacute;, not bad for a kid whose
              creative writing T.A. here at the U of MN told him he was such a
              bad poet he should never take another creative writing class. He'd
              been out East to check out Harvard and B.U. for grad school, after
              the graduate student in our dept here who was in charge of advising
              undergrads had told him to forget graduate school, it was impossible
              to get in and then impossible to get a job if you did get in, and
              I remember that incident, some years ago his coming to my office
              almost in tears to tell me this and my saying, don&#39;t ever let anyone
              piss on your dreams just because they&#39;re having a hard day. He cleans
              houses to support his poetry habit, it&#39;s great to see him. I kept
              saying, that was a really fun class you were in, a few years ago,
              hoping he&#39;d say, yeah you were one of the best teachers I ever had,
              but he didn&#39;t. Don't you just hate that? Then a recently retired
              colleague pulls up a chair for a long yak about departmental politics
              and history, I learn for the first time the deep sexual scandals
              of the unit I&#39;ve been a part of for 12 years. During this conversation
              we move to the sunniest window table at the caf&eacute; which becomes available
              as we get into it&#8212;the dept. chair who ran off with the evil principle
              office staff member, the abject incident that explains why so-n-so
              is a permanent tenured assistant professor, the controversies around
              last year's hiring process. All is pleasant, heartfelt and collegial
              and all keeps me from writing when I sit down to write. Thus after
              three hours there is no &#34;during the act of writing,&#34; but I knew
              this would happen and I welcome it. </font></span></p>

              during the act of writing I am ready to fall in love. A determined
              unfolding of the unforeseen, the confident crabbed shaping of ink
              traces on blue-lined notebook paper&#8212;fragile boats set asail down
              blue streams on moseying journeys to themselves, to haven in themselves,
              to shelter in their own delicate tracings and outside it begins
              to snow. The snow falls on blue rivulets, the page, the sidewalk,
              I&#39;m beset with a flurry of side-thoughts&#8212;who&#39;s in power, who&#39;s not&#8212;is
              it too hard just to make shapes on the blank expanse, the whole

              themselves in sadomasochistic pleasure-practice. To create is to
              destroy etc., we must labor, stitching and unstitching our lips,
              hands, eye-skin, to be beautiful and so forth. And what if I overcome
              my reactiveness, my oppressors, completely? My writing would be
              fully physical, my body would write a house of jewels as I moved
              down the sidewalk or the dingy halls of my workplace, there would
              be no inside no outside unmarked by wonder of colorsound (wait&#8212;would
              there be no marking, or nothing unmarked? no inside and no outside,
              or no border undecorated? herein lies the tension between spiritual
              and aesthetic practice), there would be no space between me and
              me, I&#39;d be a continuum of languagebody practice all the time, all
              senses revealed in a godhead of continual metamorphosis guided by
              the snow, the pen, the hearth, the road, the garment, the mendicant
              sensibility of open writing, tattered resplendent, a translucent
              golden leaf floating to the frozen ground of being.</font></span></p>

              not now going to get into how or why I began writing or how and
              why what I wrote got to become, or be called, poetry (by some at
              least, and those who don&#39;t call it poetry &#34;like Marjorie Perloff&#34;
              don&#39;t know what else to call it). I am also aware that it may be
              very presumptuous of me to call journal writing more natural than
              A) Cover letters on the one hand and B) POEMS on the other. I obviously
              didn&#39;t (don&#39;t?) always feel this way. But I do remember about 10
              years ago sending some writing which I called poetry to Laynie Brown
              and her telling me that it was too much like a journal entry and
              not enough like poetry and the image of a parent scolding a child,
              &quot;NOW, EAT YOUR PEAS OF POETRY or you&#39;ll go to bed without any
              dessert of journal writing,&#34; flashed through my body, an ouch without
              stilts. And so I react to this taboo, which I find takes many other
              shapes.... </font></span></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Poetry,
              or what is called that, shouldn&#39;t be, and can&#39;t be forced (maybe
              one has to trick oneself, or be tricked by others into writing it,
              but that isn&#39;t the same as being forced). I think a problem many
              poets face after publishing at least one book is that in the social
              world, the fact that you&#39;ve published and performed poems publicly
              makes you a POET...and what do poets do? Well, write poems of course.
              This circular logic is fine if one can continue to comfortably contain
              her or his other interests in that house called poetry, yet few
              can and many must strain to do so&#8212;not that straining is always a
              bad thing (and the circle may be a spiral). Freedom, sometimes,
              IS straining for it, while in it. </font></span></p>

              Yet, when someone recognized as a poet comes to you at a poetry

              content yourself,&#34; and it stuck. Even if I feel now that the style
              of want I want to make public now differs from the style I was writing
              when I came up with that aphorism. The two are inseparable of course.
              Even the most natural (lazy?) modes of writing &#34;have&#34; form and style.

              necessarily mean that I will come to overcome my oppression more
              completely than I do now, but I can, at least, I hope, become less

style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have always loved encyclopedias. There was a set by
              my grandfather&#39;s reading chair, and I would plunge into it every
              time we visited. I could look up &#34;tiger&#34; and get &#34;q.v.&#34;&#39;d toward
              a half dozen other references. This was before poetry; I was 7 or
              8. My other grandfather had the big globe I would pore over; this
              one had the encyclopedia. He would disappear into the basement where
              he had a small workroom near the laundry area. He worked on transistors
              and things there; it was always vague. When I lived in Brooklyn,
              near the street where the man called me inside to see his roomful
              of radios, there was an overgrown lot&#8212;fenced off&#8212;where a rowhome
              had been demolished. On the chainlink was tied a fresh bouquet of
              flowers and an anguished note addressed to the deceased. The same
              objects were attached to the fence every time I passed the place.
              Someone kept replacing the flowers and note. I wondered what had
              happened there, and I knew there must be some way to find out. Research
              skills would have to be honed, a Saturday afternoon would have to
              be spent at some municipal building searching through files. Unknown
              territory beckoned. I was always on my way to the library, alone
              in my enthusiasms.</span></font></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>One Labor Day weekend, while my family vacationed at
              the Jersey shore, our house burnt down. Most photographs and all
              the home movies, toys, clothes, and books of my childhood were immolated.
              Just a few weeks later, as detectives were closing in on the perpetrator
              (who had let himself in our house in the pre-dawn hours with an
              ax), my grandfather&#39;s house was set afire and he himself shot (I
              mean, he shot himself) in the head in his reading chair. It was
              the first funeral I ever went to and the things that struck me were
              that I didn&#39;t recognize him in his coffin, and my father shed no
              tears. But what had happened in the meantime was that I was told
              &#34;he wanted you to have his encyclopedia&#34; and it was duly bestowed
              on me, a little water damaged, but useful for school papers and
              rainy-day q.v.-ing until I went to college where I determined not

              my writing and where it can go. The trouble occurs when writing
              happens and isn&#39;t a result of being reactionary. Reacting is a tough
              word because somewhere inside me it brings me to the &#8212;pure&#8212; feelings
              of either envy or desire or both. And desire feels &#34;nicer&#34; than
              envy. I quit trying to validate envy but try to convert it to something
              helpful quickly. </font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Reacting to oppression may be a theme if I take on the
              idea that my poetry tries to give voice to protest, but protest
              of what a poet like myself can&#146;t help but react to: abstract
              thought over the literal, to inarticulations and unrest, and to
              the clarity of a confused ideology confounded in boredom. These
              things then play into gender and race and ultimately get expressed
              in the poem. I am very ideational (I&#146;ve never used that word
              before, it&#146;s kind of marvelous!) I like Homi Bhaba&#146;s line
              about &#34;ironic compromise,&#34; (he talks about mimicry and post-colonial
              identity, how mimicry is ironic compromise) from his book <i>Location
              of Culture</i>. I find the poem, for myself, mimics a lot of different
              kinds of voices&#8212;of ironic compromise, playful and troubled. I guess
              as a way of writing out of meaninglessness for me.</span></font></p>

              straight forwardness&#8212;anything! Even a painting gets to be straight-forward.
              Sometimes, poetry makes me feel awkward as a genre but also enriches

              does one overcome self-loathing? We may all have at least a little
              bit of this? This may play again into themes of oppression. I like
              to think about poetry as Frere talked about education, that poetry

              can be a big problem for a poet, hence the frenzy into sense-making

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There
              is a neutral non-zero (cosmic) field out there, and since life is
              a microcosm within a macrocosm, it seems to be efforting against
              the latter in order to preserve and maintain itself. Hence, I, by
              nature, am oppressed to the core, seeking the chaos that sustains
              the world of languages, stretching and curling with shame and wonder
              to and fro lamentations and prayer. Being the offspring of a marginalized
              culture oppresses me, needing an ethmoid process for direction (having
              lost mine as a human) oppresses me. </font></span></p>

              act of writing is always on. One is always <i>en face de</i> X,
              scraping against deaf matter, reacting to or against the systole
              and diastole of it with vigor and swagger. If we were to look up
              the word &#34;oppressed&#34; in Arabic, the dictionary would lead us to
              the root and related words like press, depress, repress, impress,
              suppress. Yet, &#34;oppressed&#34; is different. Oppressed people&#39;s voices
              are muffled because with oppression, the soul and the spirit are
              implicated. What oppresses me does not occlude either, as I am always
              in the process of willing you into existence, through language.
              Love is at play here and is catching. After all, isn&#39;t that how
              it was in my family? Dad, a genocide survivor and deacon in the
              church, basically talked to God all his life (at the expense of
              his children&#39;s well-being). That&#39;s what I do, don&#39;t I? And mom,
              a housewife, was always keen on cooking/catering but not serving/hosting
              in the limelight. Isn&#39;t that similar to doing poetry in a world
              driven by capitalism?</font></span></p>

              if I were a tenured academic with a loving husband and three amazing
              children (does she exist??), and I had just recently and simultaneously
              won a Pulitzer and the California Lottery, I would still do poetry
              yes, but sadly, sadly, the work (act) would suffer, unless of course
              I latch on to newer oppressions. OK, I won&#39;t dwell on <i>des id&eacute;es
              fixes</i>. But it&#39;s hard not to these days while we, vestigial to
              a biophysically energized living system, may be at the dawn of a
              techno-driven life force, the panoramic view of which is still inaccessible
              to our present day vision. What moves or oppresses us has always
              been flow of energy related. How does energy flow in this new (what
              we now call artificial) life where code is paramount? Code over-riding
              code. How will that be for poetry? Meanwhile (I love Nanny Fine

            <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I
              intended to write you a nice piece for the <i>How2</i> forum but
              haven&#39;t been able to get around to it, and when I try to write something
              I'm rather stumped. It seems to me that anyone reading my poetry
              would see that I&#39;m am reacting&#8212;perhaps more than responding&#8212;to a
              load of social and personal forces, and if I had any way of describing
              what these were I would probably not put them in my poems, or at
              least find an adequate way of not permitting them into my poems.
              As an Asian American I&#39;ve been expected, several times in the past,
              to list these forces on some level, and have so far refused simply
              because I think they are not that interesting, or are far more interesting
              when I collide them with my interests in art, which is to say poems
              have always been more interesting to me when they both encourage
              and denounce this sort of language, of &#34;oppression&#34; and so forth.
              This sort of language hasn&#39;t seemed that interesting to me personally
              in an American context, at least, and since I expect most of my
              poetry to be read in an American context I don&#39;t know how to use
              the language in them. I think I am of several split identities,
              actually, which is to say I don&#39;t have a very coherent past, but
              in any case I think I express this by being rather polyglot in my
              formal means, hence not having to deal with the discursive ways
              of expressing whatever it is you, and now I, am writing about. </font></span></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One
              thing I can mention: I tend to think that there is a conflict with
              certain types of ideological thinking and the kind of thinking I
              find most useful for considerations of art, or poetry in this case.
              Poets become complicated individuals the more they deal with the
              problems of words, whereas it appears necessary, for ideology, to
              simplify individuals in order to create larger coherent patterns.
              This isn&#39;t to say that poets are more complicated than other people,
              but that their activities&#34;the writing and publishing of poetry&#8212;make
              visible certain patterns and attitudes in society that would not
              be visible otherwise, complex and unmediated patterns which can
              be referred to and analyzed in private. One takes it as a responsibility,
              when thinking about art, to look at all of these patterns simply
              because one wants to find &#34;where the good poetry is&#34;&#8212;after your
              adolescence reading about other literary societies and finding faith
              and excitement in those moments when new verbal patterns are discovered,
              new content introduced, etc., one becomes addicted to the process
              and challenges oneself to discover these moments as they are occurring.
              They are not often occurring, this is true; discoveries are not
              made with the frequency one&#39;s reading of the moderns or romantics
              would suggest. But nonetheless, one reads all of the new writing,
              and in the meantime attains a fairly complex picture of a certain
              small segment of society, and acquires an image of poetry society
              as a nexus through which individuals flow, many of whom, because
              of their engagement with art, have been divorced from the social
              niche in which one might figure them to have been predestined to
              fill. It&#39;s this sense of &#34;predestination&#34;&#8212;which is a religious term&#8212;that
              I link to ideological thinking that chooses to sacrifice this complex
              image for the coherent one; it&#39;s not just class or ethnicity, but
              education and aesthetic motivations. But the zinger is this: that
              &#34;ideological&#34; thinking is not limited to those poets who might be
              the most likely suspects, namely those who read literature that
              is about or which promotes ideological thinking, but that it is
              often to be found in those who don&#39;t read or write poetry for the
              reasons I have suggested above, with the hope of breaking things
              open and complicating one&#39;s sense of literature, complicate it because,
              once it has become a coherent field, it no longer resembles a place
              of possibility, of discovery, where the intelligence can run with
              the antelope. My sense is that even the most conservative writer,
              provided he or she has a genuine interest in writing poetry, will
              want to keep this field open, perhaps even &#34;incoherent,&#34; simply
              because more things happen there. Writers who have no desire of
              doing this may still end up being good and successful writers, but
              my guess is that they are missing the chance to acquire knowledge
              about&#8212;perhaps&#8212;the future, which of course may just not be very interesting.
              It&#39;s the difference between reading the conflicting details and
              reading in large, undifferentiated swaths. I guess my point is that
              there is one thing that I tend to react against in my work, which
              is anything that renders this place of poetry less disciplined and
              focused, but also less complex and dynamic. I want the &#34;field&#34; of
              poetry to constantly be a place of danger and liveliness; however,
              with the sort of obscuring of the stage that narrow views of poetry
              promote (often under the guise of social justice, and often with
              very good intentions) it becomes no place at all.</font></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Oppression
              in writing begins with the chair. The one I currently occupy is
              uncomfortable. There is a better one a few feet away but I sit on
              this unforgiving tuffet because its seat height is adjustable. The
              low height is crucial because the keyboard rests on a comfortable,
              felt-lined pull-out drawer that is not much higher than my knees.
              I sacrifice legroom for nearness to the keyboard. The cheap office
              chair has a plywood seat on which crummy fabric is glued or stapled
              and out of which two bolts stick, into my ass cheeks. So I have
              to sit on the edge of the seat as if I am completely and utterly
              absorbed in what I&#39;m writing. That is why I have to make my writing
              so exciting.</font></span>
            <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I constantly have trouble trying to find a comfortable
              position in which to write. This could be the reason why my essays
              are so angry. I write essays sitting in a chair in front of a computer
              screen, which is uncomfortable&#8212;especially when I have to work with
              a bad mouse, which was often the case last year before I got this
              computer. In conversation John Wieners said he stopped writing because
              his typewriter broke. Fortunately, I write poems while sitting or
              lying just about anywhere&#8212;&#34;Lying is ecstasy,&#34; Tzara said&#34;and I accomplish
              this with a pen and some pieces of paper. That way, nobody can stop
              me. And if the muses are in the house, I zone out or get into the
              zone, whichever. Hours pass and uncomfortable sensations come and
              go, including hunger, loneliness, fatigue, various unclassifiable
              pangs and lusts and so on. As everyone knows, poetry allows pain
              to be reincarnated as pleasure. When I write essays, however, I
              frequently have to stand up and take a break, check references,
              call my lawyer/personal trainer, change socks and so on. This exacerbates
              the situation, especially when you are pressed for time and there
              are two bolts lying in wait to board your caboose.</span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>I like poetry because it can create and destroy time.
              That&#39;s why it&#39;s magical. Time appears and disappears in the poem
              and you get to watch and listen to it happen. You get to caress
              all kinds of moments the poet has arranged for you in the room of
              the poem, and if they&#39;re good, the moments let you be the match
              that strikes them and ignites as they pass. I love writing because
              it&#39;s simultaneously a discovery and a remembrance. Poetry isn&#39;t
              for those trying to forget or avoid the inevitable. Things come
              back to me suddenly when I write&#8212;fears, hopes, loves, angers, truths.

              avant-garde is dead. There&#39;s no need to fret. What we want is a
              release from the game of necessity, or at least to reach a point
              when desire and necessity are no longer at war with each other.
              In one of his essays, Stevens speaks of that &#34;radiant and productive
              atmosphere&#34; in which poets and their imaginations move. In this
              ambience everything is a friend of poetry until proven otherwise,
              each thing and occurrence a possible vehicle with the next poem&#39;s
              cargo. Disasters are DISASTERS and nothing more. Death is another
              character on the stage of life. Stevens&#39; argument is basic: poetry
              is not reactive with regard to oppression or beauty or anything
              else. Rarely does art that has any longevity come from the attempt
              to formulate a radical aesthetic program whose goal is to serve
              some project of opposition. Of course, there are uses of the ephemeral,
              and the avant-garde has made good use of them. But the point, here

                and didn&#39;t like. The same thing can happen in music; there are
                things to rebel against, but we can&#39;t let them dictate our reaction.
