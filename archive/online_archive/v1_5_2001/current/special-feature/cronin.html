      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why 
        write poetry? How not to write poetry? I never knew the answer to the 
        first question and I no longer know the answer to the second. But some 
        important thoughts: I write poetry because, for me, it is a way of &#39;being&#39; 
        in the world. In that world (this world?) I express, communicate, make 
        sense of some things, am bewildered by others, I relax, I am stimulated, 
        I understand and I am baffled. I also eat, sleep, walk, have sex, clean, 
        cook, go to the toilet, cry, laugh etc etc. Poetry takes care of all that. 
        Poetry cares for none of that. It is an interaction of what is instinctive 
        and intuited with what is presented and expected; of awe with what is 
        taken for granted; of all that is not fully understood with all that is 
        fully understood. It is the essential mystery of humanness&#8212;all that I 
        am capable of as an intellectual and emotional entity who desires to &#39;make&#39; 
        ever more meaningful and wondrous images to push out into the conversation 
        of life&#8212;in my own words, words that never lose their mystery and do not 
        desire to, for truth is, by its very nature, mysterious. It is a constant 
        and yet everchanging joining of what I do not know and what I do; a way 
        to learn how to be whilst immersing myself fully in being. </font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And 
        in this process&#8212;for it is a process&#8212;I attend to as much as I can and when 
        I become aware of how much I have seen I am even more aware of what I 
        have missed, what it is that I might not know, what I might (will) never 
        know. That must go into poetry: the missing, the silence, the looking 
        at the knowing of oneself that acknowledges the incompleteness of all 
        things. And the contingency of the self and of the world is at the core 
        of life and thus, at least for me, of poetry, for it is in realizing that 
        one is a part, that all connections are made possible. Poetry is the celebration, 
        and also the exploration, of these connections (and lack of) and it makes 
        its way in the world by bumping and pushing and eliding and slipping and 
        wavering. I went looking for it and its way of life one day when it become 
        clear that I could not make sense of life and it has never disappointed 
        me. But then, I have never given it a hard time. I do not bad-mouth it 
        and I enter its sensibility easily and without complaint. All of its harsh 
        and beautiful musics I let straight to my heart&#8212;it can seep right through 
        the flesh if you know the proper way to eat it! Don&#39;t ask me where 
        the words come from&#8212;other people&#39;s I can guess at (and will probably be 
        wrong, but it doesn&#39;t matter); my own are less my own than what I could 
        ever guess.</font> </span>

layout-grid-mode:line'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With 
              a skin that tears ragged like a fruit this heart has not always 
              rested in this position, slightly tilted in a bowl beneath the lights, 
              a bruise two-thirds of the way down and to the side, aorta, a stem 
              and with all the significance of that without a branch and from 
              branch to tree. How to live?! I always wanted to whisper to a particular 
              lover. To keep our words beneath the terror of sound. I account 
              for this with the secret, that large bite taken and kept in the 
              mouth till it warms to the temperature of the body. This exact heat 
              it shares with disclosure, that passion that becomes too great to 
              remain an inhabitant of any place. Visitors are like this and so 
              it has been confirmed since my time here. They come with flowers 
              and oranges, never with any fruit that marks, though the flowers 
              die and do so all over the floor and furniture. They come with things 
              to tell, trying to speak but gushing or falling to the chairs with 
              a mouthful of silence. Falling in that tight circle drawn by responsibility 
              and guilt. They know me. They cannot unknow me. On good days I call 
              the nurses and ask them to bring my heart on a plate, cut into quarters 
              and seeded. I offer it round. But on days when I&#39;m bleeding all 
              over I lie still and quiet and think of my own plans. My old plans. 
              For a time my chest hums with bird-twitter through the leaves and 
              the lonely frou of the sun&#39;s soft voice, the orchard&#39;s hymn in my 
              memory sung by light that occupies the air as if a context. This 
              is when I close my eyes and move my lips into that faint language 
              of the breath.<i> Lover</i>, I say, as quiet as a sensation along 
              the skin, <i>will you eat my heart, core and all? </i>I need to 
              know if you can crush me in an instant. I need to know if survival 
              is a plea you will ignore.</font></span></p>

layout-grid-mode:line'>It is the tongue that welcomes another to the body.<br>
        The hands can only give signs.<br>
        The hair would seem to indicate joy, but cannot <br>
        speak.<br>
        The arms fulfil the desires of the chest &#8212; to love.<br>
        Eyes speculate and search for the mirror that coats <br>
        the surfaces of all other bodies.<br>
        Ears and nose peel the potatoes in a relationship.<br>
        Feet do the tricks and promote dizziness.<br>
        The spine waits bravely to be hurt so the body can <br>
        lean towards another.<br>
        The stomach stores pain and sometimes distributes <br>
        it.<br>
        The head turns, to or away, and the body before it <br>
        loses or gains edges &#8212; this is significant.<br>
        Neck, by itself, bends in a way reminiscent of life.<br>
        Shoulders are not married to solid objects as they <br>
        are in art, but are soft and reveal the child.<br>
        The pelvis, held firmly like a basket, is for <br>
        masking pain.<br>
        Fingers and toes, fingers and toes. What fun!<br>
        The genitals are always talking, even chattering.<br>
        The breasts and nipples are transparent in eternity. <br>
        Through them can be seen a dirty string that is <br>
        joined to something that can&#39;t be seen.<br>
        The collarbone is beautiful &#8212; like a staircase with <br>
        only one step.<br>
        Legs are actually tongs and should be used for <br>
        gripping.<br>
        The mouth is so harmful.<br>
        The back surrounds us with the idea of it and <br>
        together with the head is how we think of <br>
        ourselves.<br>
        When the body is naked and opens itself to another <br>
        it assumes its one anonymous posture, for even in <br>
        death and sleep we are <i>ourselves, thinking</i> <br>
        ourselves at the end of the world.<br>
        Inside another body &#8212; just at the moment of <br>
        entering and if you enter quietly enough &#8212; you can <br>
        hear the true pronunciation of your own flesh&#39;s <br>
        name.</span></font></p>
