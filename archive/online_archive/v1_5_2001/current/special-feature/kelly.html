      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
        are a great many sorts of poetry that I enjoy and admire, so anything 
        I say about the poetics of my own writing is not trying to be prescriptive 
        for poetry in general. Using words makes me aware of at least a notional 
        reader (even if it might be only oneself on another day) and so although 
        I write for my own satisfaction, my poetics are reader-oriented - about 
        pushing the way a reader will read the poem (which raises complex questions 
        about what sort of reader one is expecting). I want the reader to experience 
        something, not just receive ideas or information. A poem I write usually 
        arises from sources of image or phrase rather than from a &#145;subject&#146;. 
        Ideally each phrase or image is lucid; but it&#146;s more important to 
        get right the sensory and the affective, producing a coherent sequence 
        of experience, than always to produce easy access to some one lucid idea 
        or situation that the whole poem might be &#145;about&#146;. The way meaning 
        is structured in poetry is so much affected by sequences of images, and 
        by lines and the grouping of lines, that it often does not need a grammatical 
        sentence. So although I write in a variety of ways, my work is directed 
        to multi-layered use of language, even in poems that are conversational 
        or apparently casual phrase by phrase. </font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        challenge is to make all the elements work together: the literally sensuous 
        elements (rhythm, line-pacing by punctuation and lineation, what is heard, 
        what happens in the mouth, what is seen on the page); the imaginary sensuous 
        (overt imagery and implied or latent imagery); the voice of the speaker 
        (who is at least partly, and sometimes entirely, fictional); and intertextual, 
        cultural and unconscious elements. That&#146;s the sort of analysis that 
        happens when I come back and try to look objectively at a draft, and it 
        aims at an ideal that may never be achieved. However, while I&#146;m actively 
        writing I&#146;m not working on a theory, just trying to make this poem 
        feel as right and as strong as possible. </font></span>
