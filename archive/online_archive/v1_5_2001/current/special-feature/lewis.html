        am currently writing a lot of prose poems. The poems just seem to fall 
        that way on the page, regardless of how they start out. Precision, brevity 
        and appropriate verse form have always been of value to me as a writer. 
        I&#39;m trying to bring these things to bear on my prose poems, but to an 
        extent this mode is unknown territory.</font></span>

        I like the idea of a lateral narrative&#8212;telling a story in a way that appears 
        fragmented but has an internal, intuited logic. Of describing the psychological 
        reality of a story via the choice of literal descriptions. It&#39;s hard to 
        do, and I&#39;m not sure why it is important to me&#8212;my earlier poems have very 
        little narrative content, are more &#39;still&#39; in that they take as subjects 
        particular moments.</font></span>
  <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
layout-grid-mode:line'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        guess I like the idea of following my ideas through, of testing the limits 
        of a metaphor until it hits the point of absurdity. And maybe drawing 
        some new, inferred meanings from that which will lead to new poems.</font></span>

        mild night. He craves relief from a flat world. From watching stones thrown 
        from a jetty, abysmal little stones in a bottomless pool, floating downwards 
        on some mystical arc, probably to surface again later in another country. 
        Coming home he feels nothing. Objects sold or thrown out over years. And 
        the people &#8212; all older. Pain is so filthy when it affects the body. Each 
        night, he stubs himself out with sleep. And her face will move with him 
        like fever when the sun has gone from the fields. Who is holding him now 
        like glass, with a like compassion? Black river, his second wind.</font></span>

        he wakes I dare not sleep. And it won&#39;t stop, this vigilance. Because 
        in darkness hope can grow, as in a womb. Days dip into oceans of feeling, 
        and the rider cannot rest until he arrives at the other&#39;s side. But who 
        needs care and who is frantic? Can injuries be traced to one body? <i>&#34;</i>Surrounded
