      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>My introduction to Anna's poetry was through a mutual 
        acquaintance asking if Anna could send me a manuscript for consideration 
        for a fine press book. After an initial reading, I wrote to Anna expressing 
        interest, but I couldn't do anything for a year as I was in production 
        with a project. Four months passed and I read the work again. Anna's poetry 
        resonated with me in such a visual way, that it inspired a set of photographs 
        tied to each poem in the suite titled <i>Broder</i>. We met and agreed 
        to join in a collaboration that would bring the photographs and poems 
        together in a fine press artists book.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>About the poems</b></span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The title <i>Broder</i>, with its proofreader&#39;s &#39;transpose&#39; 
        mark in the word to make &#39;Border&#39; is a play on the French word to embroider, 
        and indicates that this work usually occurs along the edges of a piece. 
        The poems look at specific types of embroidery and lacework, challenging 
        the idea that stitching is simply &#34;surface ornament.&#34; The various kinds 
        of openwork described&#8212;drawn-thread work, broderie anglaise, and faggoting 
        (decorative bridging between strips of cloth) are all concerned with opening 
        up the woven surface. Embroidery is seen as stereotypically female and 
        docile, but the techniques described here&#8212;piercing, binding, etc.&#8212;speak 
        more of violence than gentility. The underlying theme of the violence 
        that enters women's lives through the domestic arena is central to the 
        poems and the images.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>About the photographs</b></span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>These images are meant to be seen alongside their respective 
        poems and are not intended to stand alone. However they are not merely 
        illustrations of the poems, but responses to them. I set up the photographs 
        from items in my collection of fine linens that I've saved from boxes 
        of rags I get from St. Vincent de Paul's for cleaning up my press. Although 
        these beautiful old pieces of needlework are worn, slightly stained or 
        ripped (and thus seen as unsuitable to sell in the shop), I would never 
        use them as rags so I keep them in a cupboard in my studio. The fact that 
        these linens were cast off this way brings yet another equation for women's 
        lives into the work.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The series of photographs begins with an image that is 
        soft, reflective and gentle; an unformed piece of weaving, and moves through 
        various stages to the final image of a slash and the open blades of a 
        scissors alongside torn threads, evoking both female anatomy and the sharp-edged 
        violence that is the underlying theme of the poetry suite. These abstract, 
        beautiful images and poems draw the reader in and slowly reveal the dual 
        nature of women's domestic lives.</span> </font>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I was also compelled by the formal qualities of Anna's 
        poems. Her attention to the spacing and the quality of her lines attracted 
        me as a letterpress printer who sets type by hand. We are both sensitive 
        to the look of the page and how the visual informs the text. I designed 
        the book in a square format which fit the poems and gave me a neutral 
        space in which to work.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The book is an accordion format comprised of five images 
        with five poems, alternating between image and text. The pages are individual 
        sheets, 6 x 6&quot; joined by strips of black and white reversible Unryu 
        paper, with the black serving as a border between the pages. The book 
        is bound on black linen cloth-covered boards, with a black flax slip sleeve 
        over the book. The sleeve has a title label affixed to the front and the 
        colophon on the back. A linen-covered clamshell box houses and protects 
        this book.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The images are B/W duotones printed with archival inks. 
        The text is handset type in Perpetua and letterpress printed.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><i>Broder </i>was the winner of the 2000 Minnesota Book 
        Award in the Fine Press Category and was included in the &#34;Recent Acquisitions&#34; 
        exhibit at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and in &#34;15 Years, Faculty

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I&#39;m still amazed at what Paulette has made from this 
        tiny sequence of poems. For me, one of the most exciting parts of our 
        collaboration was visiting her studio, not long before I left Minneapolis 
        to move to Buffalo. We&#39;d spoken on the phone and exchanged letters (neither 
        of us had home email at that point), and weren&#39;t sure that we&#39;d manage 
        to fit in a meeting, too. When I arrived at her studio, in a loft conversion 
        in downtown Minneapolis, I expected to see sample papers, typefaces, and 
        possible illustrations, maybe a layout or two. Instead, a beautiful dummy 
        of the entire book was spread out on her workbench, very nearly complete. 
        </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>She&#39;d mentioned that she was thinking of including photographs, 
        and I had felt a bit hesitant about &#34;pretty-pretty&#34; illustrations of dainty-looking 
        embroidery. I couldn&#39;t have been further from the spirit of her work, 
        the way its starkness contains softness and vulnerability, the sensuality 
        of folds together with the hardness and softness of edges. I was, of course, 
        extremely excited to see such a lovely and sensitive interpretation of 
        my work, but also very moved by what it had sparked in her: a delicate 
        and subtle moon-shape that emerges in the second image, and the unmistakable 
        brutality of the last image (it was only when I saw that I remembered 
        that I had had to do some writing on female circumcision at the time I 
        was developing these poems&#8212;a another take on cutting and stitching...). 
        That final image and its accompanying poem (the latter originally published 
        in <i>Prosodia</i>) appeared in the dummy as the last-but-one piece. As 
        soon as I saw it there, I realized that it needed to move to the end, 
        and that the poems are in fact much more of a sequence than I had thought. 
        </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I don&#39;t think we had talked much about embroidery itself, 
        and I had no idea when I sent my manuscript to Paulette that she had any 
        interest in sewing and its materials. To me, this makes her work feel 
        like a wonderfully direct response to the words on the page. But I&#39;ve 
        discovered since that embroidery, or work with textiles in general, often 
        still seems to work as a kind of &#34;hidden&#34; language for women readers, 
        despite its wide currency in feminist criticism. Women friends see <i>Broder</i> 
        and are first, inevitably perhaps, struck by its violence, and then start 
        to tell me about the church lace an aunt made, or crewel work done as 
        a teenager, and I&#39;m aware this is something they haven&#39;t talked about, 
        or even thought about, for years. I&#39;m interested in the possibility of 
        writing in &#34;all the languages I know,&#34; including a poem that is partly 
        written in stenographer&#39;s shorthand, one now (gladly!) neglected part 
        of my background. Another part of my experience is proof-reading and copy-editing 
        for book publishers; the transposition mark in the title comes out of 
        this. Paulette suggested that I provide her with some handwritten samples 
        that she could use to make a plate. And so my handwriting (&#34;the mark of 
        the poet,&#34; as I think she described it!) enters into the printed book.  
        Similarly, I had always thought of these poems as being in a square format, 
        but I don&#39;t think I had mentioned this to Paulette (I took a copy of Barbara 
        Guest&#39;s <i>Quill, Solitary Apparition</i> to her studio, to show as an 
        example, only to find that she had already planned a very similar shape!) 
        Page format and the alignments of the words&#8212;up and down the page as well 
        as across&#8212;are very important to me. Paulette not only understood this, 
        but was able to use her typographer&#39;s (and photographer&#39;s?) eye to arrive 
        at much more satisfying and subtle arrangements than I could achieve on 
        my Apple at home.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The original manuscript I sent to Paulette seemed to 
        be mainly about green spaces and flowers; at some point &#34;linens, spread&#34; 
        had crept into it, and this group of poems took off from there, and now, 
        of course, have taken on a life of their own. That was a process that 
        started to happen when Paulette told me that she was thinking of selecting 
        this group to work with. Whereupon I sent her a revised set with the working 
        title of &#34;Surface Ornament&#34; and (I think it was at this stage, but may 
        be misremembering) provided some background notes on that theme. </span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I also noticed&#8212;to my pleasure!&#8212;that the treatment of 
        this group seems very &#34;American,&#34; even though the fuller manuscript seemed 
        to be set in a deliberately idyllized England. (The italicized material 
        in the introductory poem comes from Rose Macaulay&#39;s 1930s novel, <i>They 
        Were Defeated</i>, about an imaginary young woman poet in 17th-century 
        Cambridge.) Paulette mentioned the atmosphere of the lofts where she works, 
        and their industrial history. I think I can see how this has influenced 
        the treatment of the photos, which in some ways are very plain and to 
        the point, and remind me a bit of black-and-white or sepia-toned photos 
        in an old embroidery manual, perhaps rather like the big sewing encyclopedia 
        I had as a child&#8212;passed on to me from my mother&#8212;where I would have first 
        read about techniques like faggoting, and seen exactly how smocking was 
        done. But even in a book like that, written for middle-class enthusiasts, 
        and maybe for school libraries, there&#39;s also a sense of sewing as industry&#8212;not 
        only dress-making and upholstery, but something like Mountmellick work, 
        a fine kind of embroidery that was originally developed, I believe, to 
        provide work for a particular community of women in Ireland. (That process, 
        of course, is still going on in the Third World, some of it &#34;fair-traded&#34; 
        to the Developed World, some not.) So when I saw Paulette&#39;s photos laid 
        out in her loft space, I thought I detected a faint but entirely unsentimental 
        period flavor, and was reminded of immigrant textile workers in the USA 
        during the 19th and 20th centuries, and how one might make images of their 
        work.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I hope it&#39;s clear from all this how immensely satisfying 
        the collaboration was, and how the different media we chose to use (photography 
        and book-making and putting together poems) seemed to communicate in a 
        direct way beyond what we articulated to each other in notes and discussion. 
        Particularly pleasurable to me was the way that Paulette didn&#39;t stop at 
        interpreting, or even realizing the poems in book form, but used them 
        as occasions for her own creative work; as she describes it, a gathering-up 
        of &#34;unconsidered trifles&#34;&#8212;rags, tags, scraps of old histories&#8212;taking me 
        back to my own obsessions with fragments, oddments, and what seems to 
        have been cast off.</span></font>
