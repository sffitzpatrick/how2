What makes this climactic statement         of demand (desire&#39;s correlate in Lacan&#39;s terminology) in language so powerful         is, of course, what has come before it. The sequence, &#34;O&#39;clock,&#34; is the         longest of the text, and, to pay due attention to its affect, the most         painful.
