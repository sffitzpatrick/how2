Eleven         of them are women,* which is an improvement on some other recent British         innovative poetry anthologies, but still disappointing.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>         </span>As a poetic project, <i>foil</i>, according to Johnson, &#34;represents         changes in expectation of&#8212;and within&#8212;language; idioms up for grabs.&#34; Such         changes emerge through writing that is &#34;[p]unned, sampled or appropriated,         serpentine and spatial, hysteric or vitriolic: this poetry pays keen attention         to sound and has a driving pulse rhythm.&#34; As we might expect from an anthology         of this size, the editor&#39;s description holds only partially true.</font></p>      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>For         Johnson <i>foil</i> contains, &#34;a generation of writers, performers, activists,         mavericks and shadowy presences&#8211;many not previously anthologized&#8211;The 20<sup>th</sup>         century&#39;s last invisible generation.&#34; Again there are exceptions to this         generalisation, such as John Kinsella and Tracy Ryan. It is nevertheless         true that many have only had pamphlets published. Johnson emphasises how         these younger British poets, writing outside the mainstream, are inadequately         published and undistributed. Accordingly, he draws attention to &#34;the event&#34;          that could be said to constitute poetic performance. However, not all         the poets here would define themselves through performance.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>Sometimes         it seems easier to think of this large anthology in terms of provenance,         the centres of culture that Johnson has drawn on.  In England these include         Dartington College of Arts and Cambridge. Perhaps not quite so romantically         outside the &#34;the standardised English education system&#34; as Johnson would         have us believe!</font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>Although         I read <i>foil</i> with interest and mostly pleasure, my focus in this         review is on the women poets that Johnson includes. His choice here, as         we might expect, tends to reflect his general preferences within the anthology.         Most of the women poets Johnson showcases are linguistically innovative,         to use a phrase that he will not have the anthology be defined by. One         exception is the volume&#39;sfirst female contributor, Meg Bateman. Here         we have simultaneous versions of her poems in Gaelic and English. Living         on the Isle of Skye, she learned Gaelic as a non-native speaker. Bateman         is one of various poets that Johnson includes who use other languages         in their writing. However, there is a great difference between using other         languages in fairly traditional form, as Bateman does, and the distortion         and incorporation of other languages which we find in poets such as Caroline         Bergvall and Brigid McLeer, or even Tracy Ryan. McLeer, who was born in         Ireland, incorporates Gaelic into her complex collage, &#34;Collapsing here,         version 2.3: home &#39;go foil.&#39;&#34; I think it is hard to find experimental         poets actually living north of Hadrian&#39;sWall and this view seems to be         reinforced by Johnson&#39;sother choice of woman poet living in Scotland,         Alison Flett. Writing in Scots dialect, she celebrates rather than disrupts         the spoken language. Her use of the popular monologue no doubt works very         well in performance. An example is &#34;Whit Lassyz Ur Inty&#34; (or, what lassies         are into), which revolves around the &#34;shite&#34; of the dancing toy ballerina         of childhood. How odd to have this followed by Drew Milne and lines such         as &#34;beyond purely verstehenden explication&#34;! Their poetics could not be         further apart.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>In         both Bateman and Flett&#39;scase Johnson seems to have been drawn to them         because they demonstrate his interests beyond the experimental. In Flett&#39;s        case it is evidently the performance.  In Bateman&#39;s case it is her &#34;questioning         of utilization of landscape&#34;&#8212;as a strong rural theme runs through this         anthology. Reflecting his own writing, Johnson is strongly drawn to work         which combines the experimental and the pastoral. There is evidently a         tension here between the modern and the world we have almost lost or never         existed.  </font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>The         women poets who express this tension in new and interesting ways include         Helen Macdonald, Jenny Chalmers and Harriet Tarlo. Macdonald, who has         worked in falcon conservation and research programmes is interested in         the tension between the lyric voice and specialist vocabularies which         fracture the sense. She takes these vocabularies from science and biology         &#34;orienting the reader into a field populated by different versions of         the self and its relation to the natural world.&#34; For example, the poem         &#34;Dale&#34; begins: &#34;The storm runs forth on several seas whose manner is/         the hard edge of a clamber down gneiss with a split thumb.&#34; Chalmers work         is, I think, more lyrical than Macdonald&#39;s, though still challenging.         She is more concerned with the language of passion interwoven with the         language of landscape: &#34;the language/ riots then expires or goes/ wandering         across these hollows/ searching for the border.&#34; </font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>Harriet         Tarlo also writes &#34;outside&#34;: &#34;writing outside is being on the outside         of what you cannot understand&#8211;writing outside is also being in it, being         aware of where it is...the inter-linking elements...to carry on your back         the history of the sublime, beautiful and close-your-eyes-to-all-the-rest         aspect of pastoral...to know and use your own desire in language, desire         in landscape&#8230;to know that place does not come free.&#34;  The visual presentation         of Tarlo&#39;spoetry is also significant, and shared with some of the other         poets in <i>foil</i>. Johnson comments on it in the introduction when         he refers to the &#34;text as environment, matched by the book,&#34; and some         of these poets have produced books which are visual objects. In this anthology         only McLeer&#39;swork includes graphics, and I missed the visual component         in the extract from Tertia Longmire&#39;swork, since she is an important         artist as well as poet. In Tarlo&#39;swriting, to return to the natural metaphor,         the poem moves like waves across the page. Elsewhere the effect of large         font size words is breathtaking. It draws attention to the excitement         of the words, &#34;building&#34; them, as the natural patterns are built up.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>        </span>If         I have found myself focusing especially on these experimental women writers         of the natural world, I think it is because this is also Nicholas Johnson&#39;s        preferred locus, and somehow these poets are best represented.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;'>*The poets are Meg Bateman, Tracy Ryan, Caroline Bergvall, Brigid McLeer,         Alison Flett, Danielle Hope, Helen Macdonald, Jenny Chalmers, Harriet         Tarlo, Tertia Longmire, and Karlien van den Beukel.</span></font></p>      </font>       <hr>      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bio:         Frances Presley lives and works in London.
