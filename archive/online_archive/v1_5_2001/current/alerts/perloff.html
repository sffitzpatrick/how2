Underneath the portrait, Duchamp inscribed the letters <i>L.H.O.O.Q</i>,         a sequence which, read aloud in French, equals <i>elle a chaud au cul</i>         (she has a hot ass). But his was not just a crude joke; as he explained         it many years later, &#34;The curious thing about that moustache and goatee         is that when you look at the <i>Mona Lisa</i> it becomes a man.  It is         not a woman disguised as a man; it is a real man, and that was my discovery,         without realizing it at the time.&#34;  </font></span>       <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here         Duchamp implies playfully what Freud, in his famous study of Leonardo         da Vinci, took very seriously&#8211;namely the artist&#39;s latent homosexuality.         In both cases, the model herself (a local merchant&#39;s wife) is seen as         mere object, &#34;the occasion for these ruses,&#34; to use Frank O&#39;Hara&#39;s phrase         in &#34;In Memory of my Feelings.&#34; And of course art historians have taken         this object status as given: Ernst Gombrich, for example, argues that         the universal appeal of the Mona Lisa&#39;s enigmatic smile may be attributed         to &#34;Leonardo&#39;s famous invention which the Italians call <i>sfumato</i>&#8211;the         blurred outline and mellowed colors that allow one form to merge with         another and always leave something to our imagination.&#34;</span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed,         the painting&#39;s <i>sfumato</i> does leave something to the imagination,         and in her brilliantly inventive <i>Luca: Discourse on Life and Death</i>,         Rochelle Owens has imaginatively recreated Mona Lisa from multiple perspectives,         including Mona Lisa&#39;s own. Owens&#39;s is a profound meditation on how Leonardo&#39;s         painting &#34;the very epitome of Renaissance art&#34; was really produced and disseminated,         and what the process meant to the women (Mona and her friend Flora, who         appears in so many Leonardo works) as well as the children who served         as the models for Jesus and St. John the Baptist in various paintings.         Owens&#39;s &#34;narrative&#34;&#8211;which is complexly disjunctive, weaving in and out         of Renaissance Florence, our own time, and the more distant past of pre-Columbian         cultures&#8211;circles around three characters: &#34;Lenny&#34; (Leonardo) the artist/scientist,         the artist&#39;s model Mona Lisa, referred to here as Mona or <i>La Gioconda</i>         (&#34;the smiling woman&#34;), as the painting is also called, and Siggy or Sigmund         Freud, whose rationalist analysis destroys the heart and soul of the culture         it &#34;murders to dissect.&#34; In the course of the narrative, Mona and Flora         become part of a larger company of women, especially poor women from various         Indian tribes, who continue to be oppressed in the Americas of the present:</span>         </font>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Leo             na r do had not heard you you answer</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>correctly             you calculate the edge reflect</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reflect             on the sketch</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of Indian             women</span> </font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>The conjunction of time frames and situations makes for         a bravura performance&#8212;that rare long poetic sequence that holds the reader&#39;s         attention from beginning to end even though it is by no means a linear         narrative.</span></font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Marx will         never be the same after one reads Owens&#39;s <i>Karl Marx Play</i> (1973),         so &#34;Lenny&#34; emerges as a complex character, obsessed with anatomy and hence         the dissection of cadavers, much taken with young boys, alternately giggly         and abstracted, and always consumed by his work.  Sigmund is his alter         ego&#8211;hard, cold, &#34;trimphantly smil[ing] on reading/a pathological review         of a great man.&#34; In &#34;The First Person,&#34; for example, we read:</span> </font>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you             said</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the smile             of Gioconda floats upon</span> </font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her             features  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you             hook your neck</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pursing             your lips saturate your dry</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>eyelids             with oil and very lightly</span> </font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brush             in this preherstory widening</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>your             fibrous memory </span> </font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This         passage gives us a good idea of the diction and tone that distinguish         <i>Luca</i> from most poetry written today. Owens&#39;s theme, here as in         <i>The Joe Poems</i> or <i>Futz</i>, is that of <i>violation</i>&#8212;the violation         of one person&#39;s space by those others who want to control or absorb it,         who will not let it be. Freud&#39;s &#34;fibrous memory&#34; won&#39;t let the Leonardo         story be; he has to explain away childhood memories as homosexual fantasies         and find explanatory mechanisms for the artist&#39;s sublimation. But Owens         doesn&#39;t relate these things dispassionately: in her macabre vision, Freud         is seen &#34;hook[ing] [his] neck&#34; and, in a horrific image, &#34;saturat[ing         [his] dry/ eyelids with oil.&#34; Owens does not shrink from the violence         and horror she finds everywhere around her and which she projects back,         most convincingly, into what was supposed to be, according to Burckhardt         and Berenson, the ordered and measured world of Renaissance Florence.         This poet enters her narrative and calls the shots as she sees them:</span>         </font>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>             At times it seemed</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to her             she looked like other women</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wearing             a baffled look her brain</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>retained             an image the very long</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>teeth             due to gum deterioration her</span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>exhaling             suddenly looking in the </span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>middle             instead holding her head to the </span><br>            <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>side.</span>             </font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>The sardonic suggestion that Mona Lisa&#39;s fabled smile         is the result of gum deterioration is characteristic of Owens&#39;s X-ray         vision.

But Owens is angrier, more energetic, and more         assertive than most of her Language counterparts, male and female, and         she presents herself as curiously non-introspective. Hers is a universe         of stark gesture, lightning flash, and uncompromising judgement; it is         imperative, in her poetic world, to face up to the horror, even as the         point of view is flexible enough to avoid all dogmatism.</span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immensely         learned, sophisticated, and witty in its conceits, this <i>Discourse on         Life and Death</i> demands two kinds of reading.

But a second reading is required so as to note the poem&#39;s microstructure&#8211;its         superb modulation of rhythms and internal rhymes, its ironies and paradoxes.         It is the layering of cultures and especially of myths including our own         contemporary myths of the Great Creative Genius (always male), creating         beauty out of the detritus around him, that makes <i>Luca</i> so distinctive.         Watch out, Owens seems to be saying, for those high-minded claims and         take another look at the evidence of actual life: &#34;a stream of molten lava         burning,&#34; &#34;doses of nitrogen muscle saliva,&#34; or even &#34;the seams / of a         discarded wallet.&#34; Owens has no easy answers for the pain and sorrow she         presents for our contemplation but her insistent questioning is itself         a gift.</span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp; </p>      <hr>       <p style='line-height:200%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO</b>:         Marjorie Perloff's most recent books are <i>Wittgenstein&#39;s Ladder </i>(1996)         and <i>Poetry On &amp; Off the Page</i> (1998).  She has just retired         from the Sadie D.
