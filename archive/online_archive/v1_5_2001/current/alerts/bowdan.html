        I have a fault to find with<i> Aleatory Allegories</i>, it is that Susan 
        Schultz&#146;s use of detail is so fascinating that I get caught up in 
        it and neglect to attend to the larger configurations this collection 
        produces. Take the movement of an idea into an image, and the flow from 
        one poem into another: after Schultz reports on a poll on angels which 
        found &#34;half of all Americans believe actual,&#34;(&#34;Oceanic Feeling&#34; 5) in 
        the next poem, she deftly twists David Letterman into Emily Dickinson, 
        &#34;stupid/angel tricks, inebriate godsends (quite/literally).&#34;(&#34;Promised 
        Notes&#34; 7) Or take the hunger in &#34;Spare Ribs&#34; for actual solutions to real 
        and spiritual poverty: this travels from Biblical laws to prophetic caveats 
        for writers by way of commercial schemes:</font></span>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>But this collection is more than a tour de force, a show 
        of poetic pyrotechnics lighting up obsessions from baseball to brainwaves, 
        the natural to the national, continuously changing angles to reflect more 
        light. (&#34;Submit most baroque life plans/to the zoning board,&#34; she says 
        in &#34;Performance Art.&#34;) The question of representation and its intersection 
        with the real is always linked to the problem of moral agency. Schultz 
        asks about life as art; how, as military strategy, you are to map it, 
        live it happily, knowing that &#34;happily&#34; originally meant &#34;by chance.&#34; 
        (&#34;An arbitrary happiness is elicited by/dissonance,&#34; she says in &#34;Promised 
        Notes,&#34; and in &#34;Ceci n&#39;est pas,&#34; &#34;Accidental happiness is/what there is.&#34;)  
        </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The logic of this world may turn on random puns, allowing 
        us to deliberate on the fall of spiritual to market values. The book is 
        divided into five sections. In the first, Schultz opens her quest for 
        art into the question of her own motives: &#34;Is it art, or real/danger that 
        confronts me when I/leave my white house to forage/among the witnesses 
        of this world to find another?&#34; (&#34;Oceanic Feeling&#34; 6) Associations take 
        her repeatedly to history, political maneuverings, mothers and language. 
        The second section continues to deal with these issues, countering selfish 
        needs to social ones, examining how things go wrong somewhere between 
        Murphy&#39;s Law and planned obsolescence and attempting to settle there: 
        &#34;This will be/my paradise, this never knowing.&#34;(&#34;Prone in a Rowboat&#34; 20) 
        The third section disturbs this, facing terrible truths that politics 
        and media sensationalize as dramathe war in Bosnia, the existence of 
        death row, the situation of the homeless. &#34;I think there is/such a thing 
        as overload of meaning,/synonymous with the suffering that we/forgive 
        ourselves for seeing.&#34;(&#34;Star-gazing&#34; 49) Schultz directs a stream of questions 
        for Oswald about Kennedy&#39;s death, a paranoid media frenzy commenting on 
        how even the portrayal of justice is distorted and thwarted.(52) In &#34;Safe 
        Haven,&#34; she warns, &#34;Put off posterity: madeleine dipped/in blood triggers 
        centuries of worse.&#34;(54)</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The fourth part of the collection is Schultz&#39;s long poem, 
        &#34;Holding Patterns.&#34; Earlier, in &#34;Oceanic Feelings,&#34; she discerns, &#34;Recurrence 
        of pattern is confinement&#34;(5). Here, against the &#34;old specter of benign 
        neglect&#34;(62) and the &#34;history of deprivation,&#34;(63) Schultz plots our losses, 
        in some ways caused by what we refuse to do without: </span> </font>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Homelessness runs through the poem, with even (or especially) 
        infants threatened (in real estate language) by amortization; added to 
        this is the crossing of language zones, the insecurity of language&#39;s impact 
        on people: &#34;Are we convertible?&#34;(61) There are moments of advice, the 
        serious mixed with the parodic: &#34;Only adapt&#34;(65); &#34;Attempt no field goal 
        before its time&#34;; &#34;Scan refusal for clues of recompense&#34;(69). Recompense 
        is in the pensive, in the ephemeral transitions of language from one field 
        to another, across the world on email or airplanes or inside the navigation 
        of metaphors. &#34;Our business is to relay possibility&#34;: &#34;screen messages 
        stay fixed/like visualizations meant to/effect cures by symbolism&#8230;/&#8230;image/visioned 
        to prove poetry&#39;s worth,/the literal healing art of/substitution and eventual/decay.&#34;(71)</span>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>From this holding pattern, a plane above the world trying 
        to gain an objective view of it, we land precariously: in &#34;Performance 
        Art,&#34; we are still on the mission &#34;to overfly enemy territory, taking/care 
        to avoid friendly fire, noting/&#8230;missiles /pointed, you suspect, at your 
        own back yard. No landscape that is not/moralized interests the inner 
        cartographer.&#34;(77) We come then to a series of intersections mapped by 
        the vectors of the recurrent images, the communications, commerce, relations 
        and games (whether baseball or mind), and in these crossings, what was 
        neglected, unknown, unexpected as love, rises to the surface to be cared 
        for. &#34;Finders sweepers;/to the early bird goes the trumpet,&#34;(98) Schultz 
        writes in &#34;Major Funding for Despair.&#34; In &#34;At Chaos Gate,&#34; &#34;order conceived 
        as dry land [is]/where line-ups of cartoon heads/turn to see caravans

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the end, it is those details, their fascinating and 
        intricate connections, that make us see the complexity of the real world 
        without the flattening attempts of media spins and sound bytes, without 
        the superficiality we can fall for in lazily desiring simple pictures, 
        obvious solutions. Schultz&#39;s allegories reward their reading and deserve 
        re-reading; their attention to the world demonstrates how it is in caring 
        for the small, chance-met things that you find what you need.</span></font>
