Take the movement of an idea into an image, and the flow from         one poem into another: after Schultz reports on a poll on angels which         found half of all Americans believe actual,(Oceanic Feeling 5) in         the next poem, she deftly twists David Letterman into Emily Dickinson,         stupid/angel tricks, inebriate godsends (quite/literally).(Promised         Notes 7) Or take the hunger in Spare Ribs for actual solutions to real         and spiritual poverty: this travels from Biblical laws to prophetic caveats         for writers by way of commercial schemes:</font></span>       <blockquote>         <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>contracts </span><br>          <spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>signed only to be breached</span><br>          <spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>when a better offer knocks           at the door</span><br>          <spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>like baby Moses.

(Submit most baroque life plans/to the zoning board, she says         in Performance Art.) The question of representation and its intersection         with the real is always linked to the problem of moral agency. Schultz         asks about life as art; how, as military strategy, you are to map it,         live it happily, knowing that happily originally meant by chance.         (An arbitrary happiness is elicited by/dissonance, she says in Promised         Notes, and in Ceci nest pas, Accidental happiness is/what there is.)          </span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>The logic of this world may turn on random puns, allowing         us to deliberate on the fall of spiritual to market values. The book is         divided into five sections. In the first, Schultz opens her quest for         art into the question of her own motives: Is it art, or real/danger that         confronts me when I/leave my white house to forage/among the witnesses         of this world to find another? (Oceanic Feeling 6) Associations take         her repeatedly to history, political maneuverings, mothers and language.         The second section continues to deal with these issues, countering selfish         needs to social ones, examining how things go wrong somewhere between         Murphys Law and planned obsolescence and attempting to settle there:         This will be/my paradise, this never knowing.(Prone in a Rowboat 20)         The third section disturbs this, facing terrible truths that politics         and media sensationalize as dramathe war in Bosnia, the existence of         death row, the situation of the homeless. I think there is/such a thing         as overload of meaning,/synonymous with the suffering that we/forgive         ourselves for seeing.(Star-gazing 49) Schultz directs a stream of questions         for Oswald about Kennedys death, a paranoid media frenzy commenting on         how even the portrayal of justice is distorted and thwarted.(52) In Safe         Haven, she warns, Put off posterity: madeleine dipped/in blood triggers         centuries of worse.(54)</span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>The fourth part of the collection is Schultzs long poem,         Holding Patterns. Earlier, in Oceanic Feelings, she discerns, Recurrence         of pattern is confinement(5).

Recompense         is in the pensive, in the ephemeral transitions of language from one field         to another, across the world on email or airplanes or inside the navigation         of metaphors. Our business is to relay possibility: screen messages         stay fixed/like visualizations meant to/effect cures by symbolism/image/visioned         to prove poetrys worth,/the literal healing art of/substitution and eventual/decay.(71)</span>         </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>From this holding pattern, a plane above the world trying         to gain an objective view of it, we land precariously: in Performance         Art, we are still on the mission to overfly enemy territory, taking/care         to avoid friendly fire, noting/missiles /pointed, you suspect, at your         own back yard.

Schultzs allegories reward their reading and deserve         re-reading; their attention to the world demonstrates how it is in caring         for the small, chance-met things that you find what you need.</span></font>       </p>      <hr>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b>         Janet Bowdan teaches at Western New England College and publishes both         poetry and criticism.</font></span>       <p>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="index.html">alerts</a>         </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="../index.html">table         of contents</a> </font></p>      <hr>        <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </td>  </tr>    <tr>     <td width="86" height="1" valign="top"><img width="1" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="14" height="1" valign="top"><img width="14" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="1" height="1" valign="top"><img width="1" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="60" height="1" valign="top"><img width="17" height="1" src="../../transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
