A legacy of avant-garde         practice by African-American women poets including Julia Fields and Elouise         Loftin. A legacy of work that has escaped the notice of most scholars,         that has been allowed to go out of print, or was poorly published in the         first place. It is important to situate Hunt within this context of innovative         African-American writing, a corollary and a parallel process of which         is dismantling the construction of the American poetry avant-garde as         white. The history of avant-garde practice by African-American women poets         has been both misplaced and misread, leading to readings of avant-garde         literatures that are entirely too white, and collections of African-American         literature that eschew formal experimentation.</font></span></p>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt,         whose lineage includes Language poets, feminist writers, and politicized         writers of color, produces works that draw upon these categories while         at the same time exploding the boundaries between them. In drawing from         these multiple trajectories, a reading of Hunt&#39;s work makes apparent the         ways in which scholarly mappings of these traditions have been insufficient.         While Hunt is commonly referred to as an &#34;experimental&#34; poet, the term         &#34;experimental&#34; as used in relation to American literatures is both an         over-used and under-theorized category. Erica Hunt's work requires one         to position the term &#34;experimental&#34; across literary traditions, to understand         how the term is used in the contemporary understandings of each tradition,         as well as how its meaning has migrated historically. This paper seeks         to position an understanding of experimentalism across the traditions         from which Hunt draws&#8212;African-American, women&#39;s, and avant-garde literatures&#8212;in         order to both contextualize and provide a reading of Hunt&#39;s writing practices.</span></font></p>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is         instructive to begin with a statement of poetics by Hunt, an essay entitled,         &#34;Notes for an Oppositional Poetics.&#34; This essay reveals that Hunt, a social         activist, is intimately involved with working to dismantle those social         structures that maintain racial and patriarchal hegemonic systems. She         has incorporated these ideals into the interrogation of language, a fundamental         part of her poetic experiment:</span></font></p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>One             troubling aspect of privileging language as the primary site to torque             new meaning and possibility is that it is severed from the political             question of for whom new meaning is produced. The ideal reader is             an endangered species, the committed reader has an ideological agenda             both open and closed, flawed and acute, that we do not address directly.             On one level the lack of address is a problem of the dispersed character             of the social movements in this country at present; on another level             it is the general difficulty of looking squarely at the roles we play             as writers in forming social consciousness (&#34;Notes&#34; 687).</span></font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>       <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For         Hunt, then, language as a political tool&#8212;and the role writers play in         shaping, illuminating, or subverting it&#8212;is at the heart of her writing         practice. Hunt goes on to call for a poetics in which it is &#34;important         to think how writing can begin to develop among oppositional groups, how         writing can begin to have a social existence in a world where authority         has become highly mobile, based less on identity and on barely discerned         or discussed relationships&#34;(&#34;Notes&#34; 687). This passage from the one articulation         of poetics Hunt has published is particularly useful in understanding         the ways in which her writing negotiates between what might narrowly be         called &#34;Language poetry&#34; and a kind of &#34;testimonial&#34; social voice often         expected from African-American poets.<ahref="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>Â  In short, Hunt incorporates         aspects of both projects in producing a work that contains recognizable         elements at the same time that it is entirely &#34;new.&#34;</font></span>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we         will see throughout this paper, critical readings which are based upon         and reinforce identity-based categories often perform a kind of normalizing         function, enforcing conservative reading practices and expectations. What         does it mean to read a writer such as Hunt up against the canonized versions         of African-American writing? I propose that a new critical history is         necessary to encompass readings of radical African-American literary practices,         a tradition that includes such writers as Fields, Oliver Pitcher, Lloyd         Addison, and Norman Henry Pritchard, and was carried forward through the         work of several poets including Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, and Bob Kaufman.         Readings that posit the avant-garde of American poetries as white have         contributed to the disappearance of a number of these writers equally         as well as a conservative black aesthetics that cannot account for their         language and poetic experiments. The influence of these writers is felt         on practicing contemporary African-American poets including Hunt, Harryette         Mullen, Will Alexander, and Nathaniel Mackey.</span> </font>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we         widen the conversation about black writing to include the precursors to         the Black Arts Movement detailed in Aldon Nielsen&#39;s excellent history         of post-World War II black experimental poetries, <i>Black Chant: Languages         of African-American Postmodernism</i>, we can begin to see how the work         of a writer such as Hunt participates in a dialogue which might include         both African-American poets from, for example, the Umbra Group, <i>and</i>         the Language poets, a loosely connected group that was never made up exclusively         of white men in the first place, though some critical histories may lead         readers to believe that to be the case.</span></font></p>             <p style='line-height:200%;'><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We         begin to see, then, with the example of Hunt&#39;s work, that the question         was never &#34;either/or:&#34; either form or content, either black or avant-garde.         Her work illustrates the ways in which reading the histories of African-American         literature and avant-garde poetries as separate colludes in a kind of         essentializing of &#34;identity&#34; in American letters that leads one to draw         pre-formed conclusions about the ways in which African-American literature         is supposed to behave. Indeed, meeting normative expectations for how         and what an African-American writer should write has often been a prerequisite         to success. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Again, if         we go back to Nielsen, we see that the necessary critical acclaim from         predominantly white critics and editors was often achieved by black poets         who &#34;sounded black&#34; or included &#34;black subject matter&#34; or content. For         those writers who persisted in &#34;sounding black&#34; in a way that was not         recognizable to a white audience, publication was hard-won, or often non-existent.         </font></span>       <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American         literatures that are seen as part and parcel of &#34;identity&#34;(eg. women&#39;s         literature, African-American literature, lesbian literature) are pigeonholed         by particular expectations for form and content. Indeed, it has been the         texts that meet those expectations that have been more readily canonized.         In the particular case of &#34;women&#39;s writing,&#34; texts that meet normative         expectations for narrative form have garnered favor from mainstream academic         critics, whereas texts which employ such techniques as visual experimentation         or use of the entire page as a field are still often absent from college         curricula. These choices were borne out of cultural feminist publishing         projects that celebrated women&#39;s poetry, particularly writing about women&#39;s         experiences. A range of &#34;experiences&#34; or subject matter constituted the         primary litmus test for what might be considered &#34;feminist&#34; writing. What         was ignored, however, was the fact that these writers were filling the         same container&#8212;the narrative poem which became institutionalized in American         literature after World War II&#8212;albeit with different content. As Lynn Keller         and Cristanne Miller illustrate in their paper &#34;Gender and Avant-Garde         Editing: Comparing the 1920s with the 1990s,&#34; the academy continues to         exacerbate the division between &#34;testimonial&#34; or primarily narrative-based         works, and feminist poetry that is concerned with linguistic innovation,         and therefore is more &#34;experimental&#34;: </span></font></p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>                      <p><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[W]omen&#39;s             contributions to experimental poetry publication today are not well             recognized in current scholarly narratives.

Thus,             Kim Whitehead&#39;s scholarly study, <i>The Feminist Poetry Movement</i>             (published in 1996), assumes that there is only one feminist poetry             movement, best represented by Minnie Bruce Pratt, June Jordan, Judy             Grahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Irena Klepfisz, and Joy Harjo.

As I have stated earlier, this is a hazard of critical reading practices         informed by identity politics. Michael Awkward examines this topic in         a discussion of the critic Joyce Joyce&#39;s attacks upon Houston Baker and         Henry Louis Gates, Jr.:</span></font></p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>Joyce suggests that there is a single acceptable black             practice of critical reading and a single acceptable outcome. Such             reading is extratextual in focus (it asks, in effect, not what the             text does, but what it can do for the Afro-American reader), and is             infinitely more concerned with content than with formal strategies.             Scholars whose use of critical theory suggests to Joyce that they             are more interested in exploring language of the black text than in             studying its potentially inspiring content are accused of disloyalty             to the cause of black liberation. Pre-supposing a uniform Afro-American             experience of racism or, in the words (if not the precise wording)             of George Kent, a singular adventure of blackness in Western culture,             Joyce and other traditional Afro-American critics argue that experience             ought to lead to a common, overtly political interpretation that is             essentially unconcerned with the aesthetic qualities of black texts.(30)</span></font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>For Erica Hunt, however, &#34;the aesthetic quality of black         texts&#34; is an essential concern of her writing practice.

The work         does so in a way that engages form as well as what might broadly be called         &#34;content.&#34; Furthermore, her writing participates in dismantling normative         reading expectations while still concerning itself fundamentally with         issues of race and gender.

It is important to note         that the current canon of African-American literature (as exemplified         by the new Norton anthology) champions work that fulfills traditional         expectation for form, content, and voice.

Baker provides insight into the ways in which black writing         has negotiated, encompassed, and rebelled against normative literary expectations.         Readings of black vernacular have changed over time, having been seen         variously as reactionary and radical. In <i>Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance</i>,         Baker proposes that the defining moment in African-American modernism         is Booker T. Washington&#39;s 1895 address to the Negro exhibit of the Atlanta         Cotton States and International Exposition, which Baker reads as an enactment         of the performance of minstrelsy: &#34;And it is, first and foremost, the         mastery of the minstrel mask by blacks that constitutes a primary move         in Afro-American discursive modernism.&#34;(17) This &#34;mastery of form&#34; is         an example of radical &#34;back talk&#34; for the African-American speaker/writer:</span></font></p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>Obviously, an Afro-American spokesperson who wished             to engage in a masterful and empowering play within the minstrel spirit             house needed the uncanny ability to manipulate bizarre phonic legacies.             For he or she had the task of transforming the mask and its sounds             into negotiable discursive currency. In effect, the task was the production             of a manual of black speaking, a book of speaking <i>back and black</i>.&#34;(Baker             24)</span></font></p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt'>For the African-American writer, then, mastery of dominant         forms took on a subversive quality. Indeed, this mastery had to take place         in African-American literature before what Baker calls the &#34;deformation         of mastery&#34; could occur. In learning to manipulate the dominant discursive         practice&#8212;which was the vernacular&#8212;Washington negotiated an effective method         of black speaking in which to &#34;talk back&#34; to the oppressor. Therefore,         Hunt&#39;s refusal of &#34;black vernacular&#34; or the &#34;authentic voice&#34; must be         understood within its historical moment. It is a moment in which the very         notion of &#34;authenticity&#34; is called into question, and black speaking/writing         has attained multivalent structures. As always, the sanctioned or canonized         version of what that voice should entail is structured to support particular         ideologies.
