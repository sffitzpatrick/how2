style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
        review the connections between Mina Loy and Ezra Pound should be a relatively 
        straightforward matter. There is, after all, no shortage of biographical 
        material on Pound, and we now have Carolyn Burke&#39;s <i>Becoming Modern</i>, 
        as well as the essays brought together in <i>Mina Loy: Woman and Poet</i>.<a href="#note1"> 
        1</a> Yet, <a name="back1"></a>while Pound&#39;s reading of Loy and his support 
        for her work have received a fair amount of comment, the available biographical 
        studies of the two poets tell us surprisingly little about their meetings 
        and intellectual exchanges. Of course, Loy hardly seemed a significant 
        player when Norman and Stock wrote their early books on Pound, but it 
        is slightly surprising to find no mention of her in Humphrey Carpenter&#39;s 
        more recent work (and Carpenter certainly has a developed interest in 
        Pound&#39;s relations with women, particularly in the early stages of the 
        poet&#39;s career). <a href="#note2">2</a> What<a name="back2"></a> is even 
        more striking is the absence of any hard information about their meetings 
        in Paris in the early twenties in Carolyn Burke&#39;s <i>Becoming Modern</i>, 
        especially as she reproduces two photographs of them together (Burke is 
        equally unforthcoming about Loy&#39;s encounters with Wyndham Lewis in Paris 
        and London&#8212;tantalising indeed <a href="#note3">3</a>). <a name="back3"></a>One 
        can actually glean very little: we know, for example, from Virgil Thomson&#39;s 
        autobiography (but not from Burke) that Loy attended the Parisian premi&egrave;re 
        of Pound&#39;s opera, <i>The Testament of Villon</i>, in 1926, and she must 
        have heard other arrangements by him because she notes in the recently 
        recovered essay of 1925, &#34;Modern Poetry,&#34; that &#34;his music was played in 
        Paris,&#34; <a href="#note4">4</a> but of t<a name="back4"></a>he conversations 
        they must have had only one intriguing trace seems to remain: in a 1943 
        interview, Loy recalled that &#34;Pound was like a child, and an old professor 
        at the same time. His craze then was endocrine glands. He would talk about 
        it a great deal&#8212;very learned discussion. Glands&#8230;were the latest thing 
        at the time.&#34; Just how illuminating Loy found this it&#39;s impossible to 
        know, but it&#39;s likely that Pound&#39;s often hectoring manner did not appeal. 
        Loy went on: &#34;He was a sensitive man who didn&#39;t think other people were 
        sensitive. One of his friends said he had brought from America the faults 
        of America, and none of the virtues.&#34;<a href="#note5"> 5</a> <a name="back5"></a>(Williams 
        Carlos Williams is the likely source of that last remark.)</font></span></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There is surprisingly little to go on, then, apart from 
        Pound&#39;s isolated comments on Loy which are, with the exception of the 
        1918 <i>Little Review</i> piece on the <i>Others </i>anthology, usually 
        brief, but insistent that Loy be considered part of the American vanguard. 
        The 1918 account of Loy and Moore is well-known, for it was there that 
        Pound first produced his account of &#34;logopoeia,&#34; &#34;a dance of the intelligence 
        among words and ideas and modification of ideas and characters&#34; (in the 
        1929 &#34;How to Read&#34; the formulation would be slightly modified to &#34;the 
        dance of the intellect,&#34; now the most familiar version). <a href="#note6">6</a> 
        Pound <a name="back6"></a>famously aligned the &#34;arid clarity&#34; he discerned 
        in Loy and Moore with a specifically American modernism. Several months 
        later, in a review section for the magazine <i>Future</i>, he wrote of 
        the <i>Others</i> anthology again, this time quoting passages from Loy&#39;s 
        &#34;Effectual Marriage&#34; (misremembering&#8212;perhaps deliberately?&#8212;its title as 
        &#34;Ineffectual Marriage&#34;) and observing that &#34;Laforgue&#39;s influence or some 
        kindred tendency is present in the whimsicalities of Marianne Moore, and 
        of Mina Loy.&#34; <a href="#note7">7</a> Beyond<a name="back7"></a> this, 
        we have sporadic comments in letters to the editor of the <i>Little Review</i>, 
        Margaret Anderson, which tell us little more than that Pound wanted to 
        retain Loy as a regular contributor, and several remarks in letters to 
        Williams and Moore which argue more forcefully for her prominence in the 
        American literary scene (&#34;is there anyone in America,&#34; he writes to Moore, 
        &#34;except you, Bill and Mina Loy who can write anything of interest in verse?&#34; 
        <a href="#note8">8</a>).<a name="back8"></a> Pound, of course, spent parts 
        of 1924 in Italy and settled permanently in Rapallo the following year, 
        thus removing himself from the round of dinners and parties which Loy 
        attended and which Williams enjoyed during his visit to Paris during Pound&#39;s 
        absence in 1924. <a href="#note9">9</a> With <a name="back9"></a>his attention 
        shifting increasingly to political and economic matters, it is thus surprising 
        to find Pound suddenly returning to Loy&#39;s work as late as 1933. The occasion 
        was an open letter from Marinetti to Pound, published in <i>Il Mare</i>, 
        the Rapallo paper to which Pound was a frequent contributor during the 
        early thirties. While addressing Pound in a friendly spirit, Marinetti 
        drew a distinction between what he called masculine/heroic and feminine/pessimistic 
        types of writing, noting that some of the writers Pound had been publishing 
        in <i>Il Mare</i> unfortunately represented the second tendency. The criticism 
        was enough to prompt Pound to write a long piece in which he paid tribute 
        to the women writers of his generation. Noting first that &#34;the most valuable 
        part of Anglo-American literature in my half-century has been nursed, 
        nourished, and supported in reviews edited by WOMEN,&#34; he went on to affirm 
        the importance of three writers: Mary Butts, Kay Boyle, and Mina Loy. 
        His comment on Loy is as follows: &#34;MINA LOY holds her position in Anglo-American 
        poetry of my decade, perhaps the most spontaneous, perhaps the most original, 
        a bit absent-minded, who sometimes succeeded and sometimes didn&#39;t. It 
        would take an entire article for an adequate discussion.&#34; <a href="#note10">10</a> 
        Whether<a name="back10"></a> or not Pound was trying to needle Marinetti 
        by praising the futurist&#39;s ex-lover, his comment at this remove in time 
        suggests that Loy&#39;s work had made a deep and lasting impression on him. 
        Indeed, he had recently returned to the poem he called &#34;Ineffectual Marriage,&#34; 
        including it in his 1932 anthology <i>Profile</i>, a work he described 
        as &#34;a collection of poems which have stuck in my memory and which may 
        possibly define their epoch.&#34; <a href="#note11">11</a></span> <a name="back11"></a> 
        </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>These fragmentary comments raise the interesting possibility 
        that, the paternalistic tone of the <i>Little Review</i> piece notwithstanding, 
        Pound&#39;s discovery of Loy was actually in some way pivotal to the development 
        of his own work. Most critics, of course, have tended to read the influence 
        the other way, drawing comparisons between &#34;Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose&#34;(1923) 
        and the earlier <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i>(1920), <a href="#note12">12</a> 
        b<a name="back12"></a>ut Carolyn Burke for one has suggested that the 
        example of &#34;logopoeia&#34; in Loy&#39;s work allowed him to develop &#34;a critical 
        theory that could justify and explain&#34; his recently published <i>Homage 
        to Sextus Propertius</i>. <a href="#note13">13</a> <a name="back13"></a>As 
        far as&#34; I know, though, only Reno Odlin in a brief aside in his review 
        of <i>The Last Lunar Baedeker</i> has gone so far as to propose that the 
        <i>style</i> of <i>Mauberley</i> was somehow directly affected by Pound&#39;s 
        reading of Loy: &#34;it must now be plain to everyone where he got the cadences 
        which come off so beautifully toward the end of <i>Mauberley</i>,&#34; says 
        Odlin. <a href="#note14">14</a> The <a name="back14"></a>observation is 
        not developed, but it has confirmed my growing sense of a kind of reciprocal 
        influence at work across these texts of Pound and Loy. Certainly, Pound 
        had been following <i>Others</i> magazine before his <i>Little Review</i> 
        piece on Loy and Moore (he was an active contributor) and he would have 
        read <i>Songs to Joannes</i> there. <a href="#note15">15</a> And<a name="back15"></a> 
        while it remains difficult to specify the extent to which Loy and the 
        poets of <i>Others</i> impelled him in a new direction, the publication 
        of &#34;Moeurs contemporaines&#34; in 1918 made it clear that Pound was trying 
        to supplement the often coy refinements of his imagist verse with a lighter, 
        more ironic <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>. <a href="#note16">16</a> But<a name="back16"></a> 
        the anecdotal observations of &#34;Moeurs contemporaines&#34;<i> </i>rarely approached 
        the complex and impacted verbal forms of Loy&#39;s <i>Songs</i>, and it was 
        not until <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i> that Pound was really able to approximate 
        the &#34;logopoeic&#34; handling of abstract vocabulary that already made Loy&#39;s 
        satirical style so distinctive. Part of the section from &#34;Effectual Marriage&#34; 
        that Pound reproduced in his review for <i>Future</i> seems, in fact, 
        to ghost the cadence and verbal play of <i>Mauberley:</i></span> </font>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Loy&#39;s use of abstract words like &#34;incipience,&#34; &#34;correlative&#34; 
        and the soon-to-be-Poundian &#34;instigation&#34; mimes the shift from &#34;palpable&#34; 
        to &#34;transcendent&#34; which for Miovanni/Papini is the ultimate test of Gina/Mina&#39;s 
        usefulness. The &#34;fantasy&#34; is Papini&#39;s, though it is ironically undercut 
        as an expression of male privilege by the fact that this is Mina&#39;s vocabulary 
        not his. He may like her softness and pliability, but the pseudo-scientific 
        word &#34;mollescent&#34; reserves to itself the force of ultimately superior 
        judgement, its analytic clarity providing the necessary &#34;irritant&#34; to 
        this lamely conventional male fantasy. Pound has been criticised for his 
        view that Loy&#39;s work displays &#34;no emotion whatever&#34; and that it demonstrates 
        an &#34;arid clarity,&#34; but in one sense that might seem a valid response to 
        a language which gains its power from its sheer externality or from what 
        Lewis would term the &#34;external method&#34; of satire. <a href="#note17">17</a> 
        C<a name="back17"></a>ompare Pound&#39;s epitaph for Mauberley:</span></font></p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The cadence and phrasing definitely recall Loy&#39;s &#34;Being 
        an incipience&#8230;,&#34; and Pound&#39;s latinate vocabulary (&#34;disjunct,&#34; &#34;intermittences&#34;) 
        similarly catches the lazy fantasising of Mauberley even as it coldly 
        holds the persona at arm&#39;s length. If Loy&#39;s &#34;Effectual Marriage&#34; was particularly 
        important to Pound (and it was the one poem of hers that he cited repeatedly) 
        it was partly because, as he put it in the <i>Little Review</i> piece, 
        &#34;It has none of the stupidity beloved of the &#39;lyric&#39; enthusiast and the 
        writer and reader who take refuge in scenery description of nature, because 
        they are unable to cope with the human.&#34; <a href="#note19">19</a> The 
        i<a name="back19"></a>dea of &#34;cop[ing] with the human&#34; already expresses 
        a Lewisian contempt for the purely &#34;natural.&#34; &#34;Art,&#34; says Lewis memorably, 
        &#34;consists&#8230;in a <i>mechanising</i> of the natural,&#34; <a href="#note20">20</a> 
        and<a name="back20"></a> the cadence and idiom that Pound develops from 
        Loy offer a way of subordinating psychology to aesthetic form, with this 
        vocabulary, ostensibly so inappropriate to lyric, conducting its own implicit 
        critique of romantic fantasy. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For it is precisely that fantasy that apparently destroys 
        the &#34;artist&#39;s urge&#34; in the second part of Pound&#39;s poem and accounts for 
        the hedonistic &#34;drifting&#34; memorialised in Mauberley&#39;s epitaph. Hence the 
        coldly &#34;aesthetic&#34; presentation of the soprano in the final poem, &#34;Medallion,&#34; 
        a part of the sequence which has caused much disagreement, with critics 
        still tending to read it as an evocation of artistic impoverishment. <a href="#note21">21</a> 
        Yet<a name="back21"></a> there is a crucial intertext for this poem, a 
        review by Pound of a performance given by the soprano Raymonde Collignon 
        on whom the singer in &#34;Medallion&#34; is generally thought to be modelled. 
        Part of the review is as follows:</span> </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>No one has a more keen perception than she has of the 
          difference between art and life; of the necessary scale and proportion 
          required in the presentation of a thing which is not the photograph 
          and wax-cast, but <i>a re-creation in different and proportional medium</i>. 
          As long as this diseuse was on stage she was non-human; she was, if 
          you like, a china image&#34;<a href="#note22">22</a><a name="back22"></a></span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>This argument against mimesis affirms a fundamental principle 
        of Pound&#39;s aesthetics, announced as early as the 1911/12 series of articles 
        titled &#34;I Gather the Limbs of Osiris,&#34; where he argues the point in strikingly 
        similar terms:</span></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are few fallacies more common than the opinion 
          that poetry should mimic the daily speech. Works of art attract by <i>a 
          resembling unlikeness</i>. Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the 
          barber&#39;s wax dummy is to sculpture. In every art<a name="back23"></a> 
          I can think of we are damned and clogged by the mimetic&#34; <a href="#note23">23</a></span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>So whether we like it or not (and most critics have not), 
        Pound does seem to have intended the sequence to end on a high note, with 
        the confusing immediacy of the passion which sets Mauberley drifting, 
        temporarily overcome by making the experience of desire one which is thoroughly<i> 
        mediated </i>by previous cultural contexts&#8212;a move which interestingly 
        inverts Loy&#39;s concluding snub to Love as &#34;the preeminent litt&eacute;rateur&#34; 
        in <i>Songs to Joannes</i>. In &#34;Medallion,&#34; the woman becomes an object 
        of desire only in so far as she is cast in a &#34;different medium&#34; and thereby 
        rendered &#34;non-human&#34; and thoroughly aesthetic. In repudiating any confusion 
        of what Pound elsewhere calls the &#34;caressable&#34; with artistic values, <a href="#note24">24</a> 
        he<a name="back24"></a> here deviates quite deliberately from the usual 
        idiom of passionate celebration&#8212;it is, for example, <i>the, </i>not her, 
        sleek head&#34; which emerges from the frock, and in the typescript Pound 
        had originally used the very un-erotic &#34;pate&#34; instead of &#34;head,&#34; the eventual 
        deletion showing, perhaps, that he was unwilling to go as far as Loy in 
        demystifying the romantic body. <a href="#note25">25</a> <a name="back25"></a></span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>If there is, then, some kind of buried dialogue between 
        &#34;Effectual Marriage&#34; and <i>Mauberley</i>, the relation between <i>Mauberley</i> 
        and <i>Anglo-Mongrels </i>is more obviously suggestive. Thematic connections 
        between the two poems have often been noted, especially the relevance 
        of the Brennbaum section and the similarity between Esau and Mauberley. 
        <a href="#note26">26</a> Bu<a name="back26"></a>t beyond these parallels 
        or allusions, there are also numerous half-echoes of Poundian phrases&#8212;&#34;The

        fascination with &#34;the imaginary/Audition of the phantasmal sea-surge.&#34; 
        Such lines do seem to stage an oblique encounter with Pound&#39;s poem, and 
        the sense of an acknowledged relation between the two is strengthened 
        when we hear that Pound apparently admired <i>Anglo-Mongrels</i> as an 
        example of the &#34;free verse novel,&#34; a description which cannot but bring 
        to mind his own account of <i>Mauberley</i> as &#34;an attempt to condense

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The partial and momentary intersection of these works 
        by two essentially very different poets may tell us something useful about 
        divergent strands within this period of Anglo-American modernism. For 
        Pound&#39;s review of Loy&#39;s work occurred at a particularly rich moment in 
        the evolution of his poetics, a moment (1918) in which he was also exploring 
        &#34;the prose tradition in verse&#34; through the writings of Flaubert, James, 
        Lewis and Joyce, and coordinating these with an intensive reading of Laforgue 
        initially inspired by Eliot&#39;s enthusiasm for the French poet. <a href="#note31">31</a> 
        It is<a name="back31"></a> Laforgue, of course, about whose irony Pound 
        had written an important essay the year before, who provides the context 
        in which he reads Loy and Moore. In that essay of 1917, &#34;Irony, Laforgue, 
        and Some Satire,&#34; Pound had praised Laforgue for his command of what he 
        called a &#34;good verbalism&#34; (&#34;Bad verbalism,&#34; he says, &#34;is rhetoric, or 
        the use of <i>clich&eacute;</i> unconsciously, or a mere playing with phrases&#34; 
        <a href="#note32">32</a>). <a name="back32"></a> Pound emphasises that 
        this is not &#34;the popular language of any country but an international 
        tongue common to the excessively cultivated,&#34; and it is that internationalism 
        which Pound specifies in the idioms of Loy and Moore as a &#34;distinctly 
        <i>national</i> product,&#34; the paradox affirming the exorbitantly polyglot 
        nature of the American language. All these concerns centering on satire 
        and &#34;verbalism&#34; are focussed in what Pound sees as Laforgue&#39;s <i>modernisation</i> 
        of poetic style, and I want to look at this in more detail since it provides 
        the key to Pound's interest in Loy and also explains why, after <i>Mauberley</i>, 
        his own work would move in a very different direction from hers. Certainly, 
        the &#34;modern&#34; qualities of Laforgue&#39;s poetry are clear enough: there is 
        his exploration of free verse and his fascination with types of &#34;social&#34; 
        subject matter; there is the daringly hybrid and neologistic vocabulary, 
        and the often risqu&eacute; management of familiar romantic themes (Laforgue 
        is said to be the first French poet to use the word &#34;clitoris&#34; in verse). 
        Above all, there is, as Pound notes in his 1917 essay, the &#34;delicate irony&#34; 
        and the intellectual cast of the writing: &#34;The ironist,&#34; observes Pound, 
        &#34;is one who suggests that the reader should think.&#34;(281) Yet with its 
        appeal to the &#34;excessively cultivated,&#34; Laforgue&#39;s work is also very much 
        of its time, the time of decadence. Pound notes in passing that Beardsley&#39;s 
        <i>Under the Hill</i> was &#34;until recently the only successful attempt 
        to produce &#34;anything like Laforgue&#34; in our tongue,&#34;(283) but he doesn&#39;t 
        pursue the question far, moving instead to a discussion of satire. The 
        more we look at Pound&#39;s account, though, the more we may be struck by 
        its partiality. It is, above all, Laforgue as &#34;purge and critic&#34; that 
        Pound wants to stress, and accordingly we don&#39;t hear very much at all 
        about the poet&#39;s darker side, about his &#34;Buddhistic sense of fatality,&#34; 
        <a href="#note33">33</a> his<a name="back33"></a> preoccupation with solitude 
        and with moments of psychic fragility, his Schopenhaurian view of the 
        will, and his quite un-Poundian pursuit of self-mortification. Laforgue&#39;s 
        &#34;nonchalance of manner,&#34; as Pound terms it, actually represents only one 
        aspect of his work, certainly masking the mordant and macabre features 
        of his irony to which Eliot was predictably drawn.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>To this we can add that the decadent and the modern are, 
        in fact, more closely interwoven than Pound would have us believe, <a href="#note34">34</a> 
        though <a name="back34"></a>Laforgue, he does admit, is &#34;exquisite,&#34; another 
        indication that the &#34;hardness&#34; for which he is to be admired is not quite 
        yet the &#34;hardness&#34; of modernist style. Indeed, the dazzling coinages which 
        feature so prominently in Laforgue&#39;s work are closely allied to the decadent 
        cult of the &#34;rare&#34; word, which, drawing on Mallarm&eacute;, sought to create 
        the effect of a language partially dead and not in any practical sense 
        for use (we can find more obviously decadent forms of it in, say, the 
        work of&#34; Stefan George and Walter Pater). In fact, the &#34;verbalism&#34; for 
        which Pound praised Laforgue might suggest something not so very different 
        from the allegedly &#34;false&#34; autonomy of the decadent style which always 
        threatens to substitute a purely artificial language for a social one 
        (the <i>OED</i> defines &#34;verbalism&#34; as &#34;the predominance of what is merely 
        verbal over reality or real significance&#34;). What is of particular interest 
        about this question is that it points up a major ambivalence within Anglo-American 
        modernism, an ambivalence which turns on the relation of the modern to 
        the decadent, and which is focused on exactly this issue of linguistic 
        self-sufficiency and verbal &#34;materiality.&#34; This strand of modernism derives 
        much of its power from such ambivalence: on the one hand there is the 
        turn to a &#34;writerly&#34; language (in Roland Barthes&#39;s sense of the term), 
        while on the other there is an insistence on the need for modes of objectification, 
        for the &#34;welding of word and thing&#34; of which Pound spoke so forcefully. 
        <a href="#note35">35</a></span> <a name="back35"></a> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>If it&#39;s not always easy, then, to see precisely what 
        Pound took from Laforgue it&#39;s partly because he seems to have seized on 
        the poet&#39;s irony as a sort of mediating term between these two ways of 
        writing. Irony offers the necessary escape from sentimentality and romantic 
        expressivism, providing a strategic means by which to affirm the self 
        as strong and authoritative&#8212;&#34;modern&#34; as opposed to &#34;decadent&#34; in Pound&#39;s 
        scheme of things. Of course Pound himself would never actually be much 
        of an ironist, lacking both the delicate touch of Laforguian humour and 
        the poet&#39;s related fascination with the minutiae of social behaviour. 
        Instead, Pound came to associate the satirical aspect of Laforgue&#39;s verse 
        with the key terms of his own modernism&#8212;&#34;image,&#34; &#34;form,&#34; &#34;energy,&#34; &#34;objectivity&#34;&#8212;all 
        terms whose technical application also implies the agonistic relation 
        the avant-garde would assume toward its subject matter and audience. &#34;Form&#34; 
        must be seen to be won through what Pound, in a discussion of Lewis&#39;s 
        painting, calls the &#34;combat of arrangement&#34;(GB, 121), a combat only marginally 
        less dramatic than his description elsewhere of the artist as &#34;the phallus 
        or spermatozoide charging, head-on, the female chaos.&#34; The connection 
        exceeds simple analogy, reminding us that this privileging of intellect 
        above emotion, along with its related activities of &#34;seeing&#34; and &#34;knowing,&#34; 
        leads not to forms of rigorous <i>self</i>-scrutiny but rather to an often 
        aggressive objectification of the other. To which we can add that the 
        &#34;inorganic&#34; style of decadent writing is not so much jettisoned as reworked 
        so as to produce an ideal of psychic authority and coherence where the 
        fin-de-si&egrave;cle writers had discerned the instability and, sometimes, the 
        very extinction of the self.</span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is especially interesting about Pound&#39;s construction 
        of a Laforguian modernism and his way of using this as a lens through 
        which to read Loy&#39;s work is precisely its programmatic partiality. Yet 
        while the values of surface and &#34;hardness&#34; so crucial to his avant-garde 
        polemics of 1918 would certainly shape the ostensible technical protocols 
        of <i>The Cantos</i>, Pound would actually never lose his parallel attraction 
        to the &#34;softer&#34; Swinburnian poetics which were to characterise many of 
        the visionary sequences of the poem, early and late. Indeed, Laforgue 
        makes an appearance in the very last &#34;full&#34; Canto Pound ever wrote, Canto 
        116, where we read:</span> </font>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>This late revisiting of Laforgue suggests another dimension 
        of the French poet&#39;s work, reminding us again that a strand of decadent 
        style runs through <i>The Cantos</i>, with the specially heightened lyric 
        mode drawing attention to verbal and phonic values in a way which the 
        ideologically clearer parts of the poem would dismiss as fetishistic. 
        These richly ornamental passages exploit linguistic density and sound-patterning 
        to produce effects quite removed from Laforguian logopoeia as Pound had 
        defined it in 1918. On the other hand, though, these highly stylised, 
        Pre-Raphaelite tableaux, with their frozen gestures and inorganic landscapes, 
        <i>are</i> reminiscent of some of Laforgue&#39;s prose writings&#8212;and notably 
        of the celebrated prose passage about the Berlin aquarium which, significantly, 
        Pound had cut from his 1918 translation of <i>Salom&eacute; </i>but to which 
        the Laforguian &#34;deeps&#34; at the very end of <i>The Cantos</i> undoubtedly 
        refer:</span></font></p>

          stumps with antennae winking at the neighbouring coral, a thousand aimless 
          warts; a whole fetal, claustral, vibrating flora, trembling with the

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The narcotic life of these aquarium &#34;deeps&#34; is as much 
        a product of Laforgue&#39;s desire for a state of will-less &#34;Nirvana,&#34; with 
        its fixity, calm and silence, as it is of an intense feeling for language, 
        whose items it enumerates with an almost sensual pleasure. <a href="#note39">39</a> 
        Ph<a name="back39"></a>rases like &#34;fetal, claustral, vibrating flora&#34; 
        exemplify less the &#34;dance of the intelligence,&#34; as Pound had originally 
        defined logopoeia, than an almost fetishistic delight in language for 
        its own sake, in the rich &#34;opacity&#34; of words, to use Laforgue&#39;s own term. 
        In becoming &#34;opaque&#34; in this way, language provides the poet with a luxurious 
        freedom, a freedom from the obsessive self-consciousness which characterised 
        Laforgue's genius but which he also felt as a constant affliction. So 
        &#34;the ideal things,&#34; he observed in another account of the Berlin aquarium, 
        &#34;are these sponges, these star-fish, these plasmas, in the opaque, cool, 
        daydreaming water.&#34;<a href="#note40">40</a><a name="back40"></a></span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>At first sight, such mindless drifting might see anathema 
        to Pound, who had, of course, satirised it as a weakness of the aesthete 
        in <i>Mauberley</i>, but by the time he reappraised Laforgue a lot of 
        water had flowed under the bridge. The experience of profound mental and 
        physical debility which Pound underwent during his years at St Elizabeth&#39;s 
        arguably made him more responsive to several new things in Laforgue&#39;s 
        writing. In the closed regions of the aquarium&#39;s dreamlike, subaquatic 
        world, words no longer had to cleave to things but could be relished for 
        themselves; and furthermore, Pound might have been led to notice that 
        Laforguian word-play wasn&#39;t just a matter of active social satire&#8212;it was 
        also intensely reflexive and internalised, a matter of intricate cross-reference 
        and echo, stylistic qualities which would come very much to the fore in 
        late Cantos such as 110. <a href="#note41">41</a><a name="back41"></a></span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have sketched these two Laforguian moments in Pound&#39;s 
        thinking in a very abbreviated way, but I hope it is clear that neither 
        of them fully defines Loy&#39;s particular brand of logopoeia. While her &#34;verbalism&#34; 
        seems closer in kind to the materiality of the second type, with an emphasis 
        on internal play rather than on Poundian &#34;objectification,&#34; it also departs 
        from the quasi-symbolist reflexivity we might discern in some of the late 
        Cantos.&#34; We can best understand this difference by looking more closely 
        at Loy&#39;s recently recovered essay on &#34;Modern Poetry,&#34;<a name="back42"></a> 
        <a href="#note42">42</a> where, as some critics have noted, the American 
        language is characterised as a &#34;composite language,&#34; a &#34;welter of unclassifiable 
        speech,&#34;(159) &#34;English enriched and variegated with the grammatical structure 
        and voice-inflection of many races.&#34;(158) <a href="#note43">43</a> In 
        v<a name="back43"></a>iew of this &#34;novel alloy&#34; (the word-play seems deliberate), 
        &#34;It was inevitable,&#34; says Loy, &#34;that the renaissance of poetry should 
        proceed out of America, where latterly a thousand languages have been 
        born.&#34;(158) What has not so far been noted about this essay is that it 
        seems deliberately to allude to the terms of Pound&#39;s 1918 review of her 
        work. Not only does Loy celebrate at the outset Pound&#39;s &#34;magnificent Cantos&#34; 
        and his role as &#34;the masterly impressario of modern poets&#34;(158), but she 
        also follows him in elaborating the paradox of a national language as 
        a polyglot one and in arguing that this is the true idiom of modernity. 
        The Laforguian idea of verbal coinage is prominent, too, for, as she puts 
        it, &#34;Every moment [the true American] ingeniously coins new words for 
        old ideas.&#34;(159) Even more intriguing, though, is the following passage: 
        &#34;The variety and felicity of these structural movements in modern verse 
        has more than vindicated the rebellion against tradition. It will be found 
        that one can recognize each of the modern poets&#39; work by the gait of their 
        mentality.&#34;(157) It is hard not to feel that this last phrase&#8212;&#34;the gait 
        of their mentality&#34;&#8212;is a calculated reformulation of Pound&#39;s &#34;dance of 
        the intelligence.&#34; If it is, it&#39;s a telling one, with Loy substituting 
        for the stylish symbolist dance the more deliberately mundane figure of 
        walking (a &#34;gait&#34; is also something a horse has). It is not necessary 
        to retrace here the historical progress of the partially disembodied dancer, 
        from Mallarm&eacute; through Yeats, to Stevens, to signal the emphatic embodiment 
        conveyed in this one word when read against its Poundian precursor. This 
        &#34;mentality&#34; takes pleasure in its pedestrian encounter with words whose 
        ungainliness and imperfection incite new rhythms and cadences which root 
        them in a human world with all <i>its</i> acknowledged grubbiness and 
        rough edges. We are already far from the &#34;non-human&#34; soprano figured in 
        Pound&#39;s &#34;Medallion,&#34; and we can also note that where Pound&#39;s &#34;logopoeic&#34; 
        words are rooted in a traditional if abstract lexicon, Loy&#39;s move between, 
        on the one hand, the recondite and archaic (&#34;elusion,&#34; &#34;aniline,&#34; etc.), 
        and deliberate if recognisable coinages, like &#34;changeant&#34; and &#34;eclosion,&#34; 
        &#34;inideate&#34; and &#34;stoppled.&#34; On a number of occasions, a word can also simply 
        be &#34;wrong&#34;&#8212;&#34;insuccess,&#34; for example. This, then, is the &#34;foreign language&#34; 
        she told Julien Levy she was trying to make, <a href="#note44">44</a> 
        a<a name="back44"></a>nd &#34;foreign&#34; not just in its repudiation of the 
        normative and familiar, but also because it is the alienating language 
        of satire, a medium which Lewis was currently reconstituting as one in 
        which the intellect derives its power from a head-on confrontation with 
        the grotesqueries of the &#34;wild body.&#34; This is something very different 
        from the epigrammatic wit of <i>Mauberley</i> and its final celebration 
        of the &#34;non-human,&#34; reminding us that Loy&#39;s &#34;Pig Cupid&#34; also finds his 
        home in the messy materiality of the garbage heap. In that sense her vision 
        is finally closer to Lewis&#39;s world of big babies and overheated German 
        frauleins than it is to Pound&#39;s celebration of &#34;Luini in porcelain.&#34; Satire, 
        in this sense, renews its connection to the tradition of the grotesque 
        as Bakhtin describes it in his study of Rabelais:</span> </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#34;the artistic logic of the grotesque image ignores the 
          closed, smooth, and impenetrable surface of the body and retains only 
          its excrescences (sprouts, buds) and orifices, only that which leads 
          beyond the body&#39;s limited space or into the body&#39;s depths&#34;.If we consider 
          the grotesque image in its extreme aspect, it never presents an individual 
          body; the image consists of orifices and convexities that present another, 
          newly conceived body. It is a point of transition in a life eternally 
          renewed, the inexhaustible vessel of death and conception. <a href="#note45">45</a><a name="back45"></a></span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The contemporary scandal of Loy&#39;s work was due, I think, 
        as much to its outrageous invocation of this tradition as it was to her 
        outspoken feminism and her public role as a &#34;new woman&#34; (the two were 
        in fact, of course, closely linked). As a result, Loy&#39;s logopoeia was 
        a notably hybrid one, turning Pound&#39;s elegant symbolist conception upside 
        down and showing the &#34;logos&#34; of &#34;logopoeia&#34; to be embedded in the very 
        body it was supposed to rise above. The &#34;verbalism&#34; of phrases like the 
        &#34;sub-umbilical mystery/of his husbandry&#34; and the &#34;impenetrable pink curtain&#34; 
        <a href="#note46">46</a> her<a name="back46"></a>e made partial obscurity 
        a means at once of evading censorship <i>and </i>of being almost gratuitously 
        specific, with linguistic density being simultaneously the measure of 
        the unseen <i>and</i>, obliquely, the embodiment of what convention seeks 
        to hide. There was a humour here to which Pound, with his rather Pre-Raphaelite 
        notion of sexual passion, was not particularly well-attuned and which 
        can be missed even by contemporary commentators like Carolyn Burke who 
        seem keen to emphasise depressive tendencies at work in Loy&#39;s writing. 
        As the connection with Pound shows, however, it was precisely Loy&#39;s achievement 
        to push &#34;logopoeia&#34; to a boisterous extreme, where even the ironist&#39;s 
        pretensions to aloof superiority would ultimately fall victim to the &#34;humid 
        carnage&#34; of the bodily life. <a href="#note47">47</a><a name="back47"></a></span></font></p>

        for a discussion of the late &#34;reversal of Pound&#39;s earlier poetics of assertion 
        and&#8230;his new willingness to entertain previously threatening and unexplored 
        states of mind.&#34;(184) Hamilton notes that &#34;Pound&#39;s regard for Laforgue&#39;s 
        Buddhist passivity [is] gradually modified&#34;(183) and that a certain reflexivity 
        in some of the late Cantos reconnects Pound to the Symbolist (Mallarm&eacute;an) 
        tradition. [<a href="#back39">back to text</a>]</span> </font>
