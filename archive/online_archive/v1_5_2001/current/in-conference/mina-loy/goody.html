        Loy was a prominent figure in avant-garde Paris of the 1920s and is a 
        colourful presence in accounts of the modernist period. She was a beautiful 
        woman who for a time approached mythic status, reputedly disputing rumours 
        of her own insubstantiality by a public appearance at Natalie Barney&#39;s 
        famous <i>rue Jacob</i> salon. Modernist accounts often offer a fictionally 
        reconstructed Loy: eg. in <i>Post-Adolescence</i>, Robert McAlmon&#39;s novel 
        of Greenwich Village life in the 19teens she appears as &#34;Gusta Rolph,&#34; 
        a woman with &#34;a romantic soul underneath sophistication&#34; who is &#34;her own 
        original portrait of the artist&nbsp;;<sup><a href="#note1">1</a> </sup>and 
        <a name="back1"></a>in <i>Ladies Almanack</i> as &#34;Patience Scalpel&#34; the 
        dissenting heterosexual voice amidst the women of Djuna Barnes&#39;subversive, 
        lesbian text.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a> </sup>Memoirs<a name="back2"></a> 
        and reports remark on Loy&#39;s physical attractiveness as frequently as on 
        her work itself, and often the two are described interchangeably. Indeed 
        Loy&#39;s public reputation as author of the scandalously frank <i>Love Songs 
        to Joannes</i> and other alarmingly &#34;free&#34; verse appeared inextricably 
        bound up with projections of her as desirable and desiring woman. She 
        represented an emblem of modernity who embodied, as much as intellectually 
        and creatively explored, the challenges and innovations of the avant-garde.<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
        From <a name="back3"></a>her first contacts and involvement with the Italian 
        Futurists F. T. Marinetti and Giovanni Papini, through her status as widow 
        of the mysteriously vanished Arthur Cravan (posthumously canonised by 
        the Dadaists and Surrealists), to her participation in the artistic community 
        of inter-war Paris, Loy was an iconic figure, a presence reported, constructed, 
        and gossiped about. Until recently one usually encountered this anecdotal 
        Mina Loy before her writing or art. Loy has however benefited from the 
        &#34;refiguring&#34; of modernism undertaken by contemporary critics,<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
        and her rem<a name="back4"></a>arkable poetry is finally being read constructively 
        in the wider Anglo-American literary world. But, while the revival of 
        interest in her work has enabled readers and scholars to begin exploring 
        and elucidating the complexities of her writing, the enigmatic aura of 
        Loy&#39;s exemplary expatriate existence remains while her poetry continues 
        to resist exclusive categorisation and interpretation.</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        are two possible approaches to interpreting &#34;Mina Loy.&#34; Firstly, one could 
        look at the ways in which she constructed and deconstructed her artistic 
        and authorial identity, actively participating in the production of an 
        enigmatic public persona. Secondly, one could focus on the import of her 
        writing, not only her formal experimentalism, but her radical political, 
        philosophical, and aesthetic vision. The starting place for many discussions 
        in this second approach is her &#34;Feminist Manifesto&#34;(1914) which expresses 
        in the innovative typography and style of the Futurist avant-garde, the 
        most extreme ideas about the rejection of masculinist constructions of 
        female identity. The manifesto calls for the &#34;<i>unconditional</i> surgical 
        <i>destruction of virginity</i> through-out the female population at puberty&#34; 
        &#34;as a protection against the man made bogey of virtue.&#34;<sup><a href="#note5">5</a> 
        </sup>This<a name="back5"></a> text indeed proposes a complete re-evaluation 
        of women&#39;s self-conceptions; &#34;<i>NO</i> scratching on the surface of the 
        rubbish heap of tradition, will bring about <i>Reform</i>, the only method 
        is <i>Absolute Demolition</i>.&nbsp;(<i>LLB</i>, 153) </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two 
        approaches suggested above do not need to be mutually exclusive. As I 
        will argue in this article, Loy&#39;s &#34;life&#34; and her &#34;art&#34; exhibit, indeed 
        proceed from, a common polyvalence, an equivalent instability and subversive 
        equivocality which serves to undermine notions of the autonomous self 
        (artist as singular producer) <i>and</i> the singular aesthetic object. 
        It is by exploring the speaking subject and aesthetic vision of Loy&#39;s 
        poetry <i>alongside</i> her systems of disguise and modernist performance, 
        considering the intersections between them, that it becomes possible to 
        elucidate some of the major strategies of her modernist poetics. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;To You,&#34; 
        a poem first published in Alfred Kreymborg&#39;s <i>Others</i> in 1916, offers 
        a clear intersection between a thematic posing of personal/public identifications 
        and a textual exploration of the construction of the speaking subject. 
        It is clearly, although somewhat ambiguously related to <i>Love Songs 
        to Joannes</i> (1917), currently the best known and most discussed of 
        her work.<sup><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> This ar<a name="back6"></a>ticle 
        proposes a strategic reading of the apostrophic &#34;To You,&#34; one which reveals 
        a linguistic subject who stands for/as the author herself, both as speaker 
        and addressee, thereby making the subjectivity of her utterance and the 
        attribution of authorial control problematic. This in turn provides a 
        clear example of the more general enunciative instability that Loy deliberately 
        exploits in her double-crossing attitude to modernism. Such a textual 
        strategy is certainly linked to Loy&#39;s presence as a woman in the hegemonic 
        masculinism of modernism, enabling her to stand inside and outside the 
        avant-garde simultaneously. Loy&#39;s doubleness can be read as an example 
        of the general textual self-consciousness in modern poetry centred on 
        the instability of the speaking-subject, an affect of the mutable culture 
        of modernity. But, as Carolyn Burke points out, in a wider sense it seems 
        a manifestation of the scrutiny of the linguistic subject similar to that 
        in the work of Emily Dickinson.<sup><a href="#note7">7</a></sup> &#34;When 
        I<a name="back7"></a> state myself, as the Representative of the Verse&nbsp;it 
        does not mean&#8212;me&#8212;but a supposed person, Dickinson writes,<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
        and th<a name="back8"></a>is personal and textual&#34; questioning of the 
        self-possessed/self-possessing author, acutely informed by the gendering 
        of the poet-genius, certainly resonates with Loy&#39;s work. Loy&#39;s undermining 
        of the assumed transparency of subjective utterance (the identification 
        of author with textual &#34;I&#34;) is mirrored in the &#34;disappearances, falsifications, 
        disavowals, and deliberate disguises&#34; of her writings.<a href="#note9"><sup>9</sup></a> 
        Her<a name="back9"></a> use of anagrams, pseudonyms, and her own renaming, 
        are all linked to her subversion of authorial certainty but they also 
        serve as a strategy for resisting, or at least co-opting the fetishistic 
        commodification of Loy, as avant-garde woman.</span></font></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loy was 
        born Mina Gertrude L&ouml;wy in London in 1882 and died a naturalised citizen 
        of the USA in Aspen, Colorado in 1966. She was the child of an Eastern-European, 
        Jewish immigrant tailor who was a fairly successful businessman by the 
        time he married Loy&#39;s English, Protestant mother, who was from a working-class 
        background but aspired to bourgeois respectability. The eldest of three 
        daughters, Loy received no consistent education and left England in 1900 
        never to return for any lengthy period. She moved between Paris, Florence, 
        and New York for the next four decades, living among the homeless of New 
        York&#39;s Bowery district before retiring to live near her daughters in Colorado 
        in 1953.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing 
        her given name from L&ouml;wy to Loy as she entered the art circles of Paris 
        in the early 1900&#39;s, Loy was forced to abandon the independence of this 
        title, along with her professional success, when she moved with her first 
        husband, Stephen Haweis, to Florence in 1906. Loy was subsumed into a 
        largely domestic role in the expatriate community, her appellation as 
        &#34;Dusie Haweis&#34; compounding the disappearance of &#34;Mina Loy,&#34; the avant-garde 
        artist, until her introduction to the Italian Futurists.<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> 
        From<a name="back10"></a> 1914 she published her poetry and prose under 
        her self-chosen name, Mina Loy, but practised a variety of linguistic 
        disguises, anagrams, verbal personas, and so on in her texts and elsewhere. 
        &#34;The Effectual Marriage&#34;(1917) details the &#34;conventional&#34; relations between 
        Miovanni and his wife Gina, certainly an intended reference to Mina herself 
        and Giovanni Papini.  In a later satire on Futurist antics, &#34;Lions&#39; Jaws(1920), 
        Mina Loy becomes &#34;Nima Lyo, alias Anim Yol, alias/Imna Oly&nbsp;, an anagrammatical 
        presence acting as &#34;secret service buffoon to the Woman&#39;s Cause.&nbsp;(<i>LLB</i> 
        49) Imna Oly also appears on the programme of a 1920 play in which Loy 
        appeared, instead of her own &#34;name.&#34;<sup><a href="#note11">11</a></sup> 
        Susan <a name="back11"></a>Gilmore argues that such disguises are not 
        simply &#34;the modernist subject [...] disappearing behind a screen-like 
        persona.&#34; Instead, &#34;Loy invokes the persona of the impostor and its linguistic 
        counterpart, the anagram, to render the woman writer&#39;s presence in her 
        texts visible yet elusive.&#34;<sup><a href="#note12">12</a></sup></span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><a name="back12"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        are disguised references in other of Loy&#39;s poems (&#34;Sister Saraminta&#34;&#8212;&#34;mina-as-art&#34; 
        in &#34;The Black Virginity,&#34; for example) and her art work is often signed 
        cryptically (and with misleading dates). Even Loy&#39;s legal name did not 
        remain static; on remarrying in 1918 she took the name of her husband, 
        Fabian Avenarius Lloyd, himself the owner of a suggestive pseudonym, Arthur 
        Cravan, and a variety of personas. As Burke notes &#34;it must have seemed 
        an extraordinary coincidence when she [...] found her chosen name absorbed 
        or contained within her new married name, Lloyd, which she took as the 
        private version of her public self. She maintained this name on her legal 
        documents even as she continued to publish and exhibit under the other.&#34;<sup><a href="#note13">13</a><a name="back13"></a></sup></span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 
        her later life Loy rewrote and re-presented her early life in various 
        ways. These autobiographical and semi-autobiographical writings (and the 
        &#34;auto-mythological&#34; <i>Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose</i>)<sup><a href="#note14">14</a></sup> 
        offer a<a name="back14"></a> range of disguises&#8212;Jemima, Sophia, Ova in 
        <i>Anglo-Mongrels</i> (suggestive of a variety of resonances from egg 
        to Oda, Loy&#39;s first child who died after a year) and, perhaps surprisingly, 
        Daniel. Even at her most personal, such as in the story &#34;Hush Money,&#34; 
        which deals with the death of her father, Loy refuses the simplistic identification 
        of author with textual subject and resists a system &#34;which abstracts and 
        universalises male authors even as it attempts to render female authors 
        all too concrete.&#34;<sup><a href="#note15">15</a></sup> M<a name="back15"></a>ore 
        than this, the biographical and textual fragments, the anagrams and performances 
        that Loy produced and manipulated suggest a disregard for a core, stable 
        selfhood&#8212;her identities and her poetic articulations issue from an unstable 
        subject position that ultimately embraces the ambivalence of contingency 
        and performativity. This radical attitude has more than a passing affinity 
        with the Dadaist performances and contingencies of Marcel Duchamp, Loy&#39;s 
        contemporary and colleague while she lived in New York. Not only her rejection 
        of conceptions of autonomy and genius, but also Loy&#39;s own approach to 
        art clearly aligns her with Duchamp&#39;s deconstruction of the art object.<sup><a href="#note16">16</a></sup> 
        Loy&#39;s <a name="back16"></a>1924 critical analysis of Gertrude Stein&#39;s 
        writing, for example, re-inscribes Duchamp&#39;s iconoclastic challenge to 
        the divisions and hierarchies of established art practice; she celebrates 
        modernism as a transfiguration of the mundane and a dismantling of aesthetic 
        boundaries:</span></font></p>

        and disruptive syntax, form, and imagery do not merely detail the estrangement 
        of the modernist poetic subject they highlight the objectification and 
        denial of women and the body that the myth of romance requires. The <i>Love

        rejection of love, emotion, and other <i>pass&eacute;ist</i> traits. A reductive 
        (mechanistic) construction of human experience actually reinforces the 
        (male) intellectual transcendence of the mechanics of life exposing the 
        inherent contradiction in the masculinist invocation of a &#34;machine aesthetic&#34;. 
        Thus, the transcendent intellect is the last refuge of the omniscient 
        Self, elevated by and through a denial of material (fleshly) existence 
        and that associated with it. As Marinetti bluntly states, &#34;we strong Futurists 
        have felt ourselves suddenly detached from women, who have suddenly become 
        too earthly, or, to express it better, have become a symbol of the earth 
        that we ought to abandon&#34;.<sup><a href="#note20">20</a></sup> In <i><a name="back20"></a>Love

        and other that &#34;Parturition&#34; enacts&#8212;is denied in the affirmation of the 
        autonomous &#34;I.&#34; From the perspective of the maternal body, the creative 
        woman can articulate the beyond, the outside that is simultaneously inside, 
        and so undermine the hegemony of the singular and the norm(al). Such a 
        perspective is derivatively reproduced in the modern movement of double 
        consciousness; it is the &#34;problematic&#34; equivocality or &#34;doubleness&#34; of 
        women/Woman that is disavowed in assertions of female inferiority at the

        her correspondence and from other evidence Loy&#39;s <i>Love Songs</i> appear

        It is possible that this biographical element to the sequence could obscure 
        the actual challenges posed by Loy&#39;s text, notably the ultimate uncertainty 
        of the voice of the sequence, whether it is, or is not, Loy as poet or 
        both.<sup><a href="#note24">24</a> </sup>To read <i><a name="back24"></a>Love 
        Songs</i> as simply a personal narrative of failure and submission emphasising 
        the disappointment of the poems, wrongly equates Loy as artist with Loy 
        as individual and with the speaking subject of <i>Love Songs</i>. (The) 
        Woman is silenced by modern love, but a voice does speak through the discontinuities 
        and ambivalences of these love poems. This voice is merely tentative and 
        partial, but it does exceed the closure of romantic myth and romantic 
        lyric alike in a manoeuvre that appears indicative of the contradictory 
        position that a female (modernist) poet occupies.</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradictions 
        and paradoxes of Loy&#39;s position as a modernist writer and as a woman cannot 
        be overstated. With the gendered ideologies of modernism (supported by 
        such studies as Otto Weiniger&#39;s influential <i>Sex and Character</i> (1907) 
        and blatantly manifest in pieces such as Wyndham Lewis&#39;s BLAST (1914/15) 
        and Ezra Pound&#39;s &#34;Translator&#39;s Postscript&#34; to Remy de Gourmont&#39;s <i>The 
        Natural Philosophy of Love</i> [1922]), to be a woman poet (not a poetess, 
        the fate accorded to Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the early twentieth 
        century) required great personal resources and unique tactical manoeuvres. 
        Loy was often compared, most notably by Ezra Pound, to her contemporary 
        Marianne Moore, and there are distinct similarities between the two writers&#39; 
        tactics of self-conscious and self-referential irony, verbal dexterity, 
        wit, and linguistic resonance.<sup><a href="#note25">25</a></sup> But 
        <a name="back25"></a>Loy&#39;s often painfully incisive poetry is the antithesis 
        of Moore&#39;s dry, regulated and controlled verse. There are also comparisons 
        to be made between Loy and both Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein.<sup><a href="#note26">26</a></sup> 
        Unlike<a name="back26"></a> these modernist writers, however, Loy&#39;s firm 
        heterosexual identification distanced her from the (textual and material) 
        strategies that they adopted; ie. Stein identifying herself as masculine 
        genius to her supportive &#34;wife,&#34; Alice B. Toklas, and Barnes revelling 
        in a sexual-textual ambiguity and excess. </span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take 
        up a position within modernism Loy, like her female contemporaries, negotiated 
        her own specific mode of being and writing which confronted the multiple 
        complexities of sex/gender, modernity and author(-)ity.<sup><a href="#note27">27</a></sup> 
        Rath<a name="back27"></a>er than employing an authority based in an ancient 
        and/or feminine or female alternative which would produce a self-sufficient 
        language (the Sapphistic tradition which informs H.D.&#39;s poetic, for example), 
        Loy used the productive gaps and contradictions in her text (as object 
        as well as signifying system). From an initial exploration of the potential 
        of the maternal body as a site and space of aesthetic conception and ontological 
        discovery (in &#34;Parturition&#34;), Loy goes on to use the text as a generative 
        matrix.<a href="#note28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a name="back28"></a>She employs 
        the suggestive spaces of her poetry (the blanks, white spaces, gaps between 
        and beyond words) and in doing so enables an iterative authorisation which 
        avoids the assumption of authorial mastery or semiotic purity. At the 
        same time, her acute sensitivity to the overdetermined constructions of 
        femininity influences her textual strategies which thus serve to confront 
        the gendering of modernism with a poetics of the situated and contingent, 
        one which asserts neither the absolute authority and singularity of language 
        nor of the self. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her 
        poetry Loy is sensitive to the performative privilege of the speaking 
        subject, a sensitivity which necessitates equivocality in the act of speaking 
        and/or writing.&#34; The instability of language that hegemonic modernism 
        explores, but through gendered strategies of displacement and authorisation 
        attempts to disavow, is demonstrated in Loy&#39;s poetry through her rejection 
        of any distinction between the voice and the text, or the prioritisation 
        of the act of speech. She offers no resolution to the crisis of representation 
        and her poetic style functions &#34;not as the privileged vehicle of avant-garde 
        authority but rather as a witness to its metaphysical pretensions&nbsp;.<sup><a href="#note29">29</a> 
        </sup>But, <a name="back29"></a>does her lack of resolution actually amount 
        to a negative response? Loy&#39;s <i>Love Songs</i> overturn the restrictive 
        ideology (and ideological representations) of romantic love by offering 
        the material reality of a failed affair and by detailing the negation 
        of female autonomy and voice in the myth of Love and in a real relationship. 
        The prevailing mood of disappointment and indeterminacy, the absence of 
        mutuality or productive self-abnegation, suggests that <i>Love Songs</i> 
        does indeed express a &#34;negative aesthetics,&#34; as Meera Shreiber reads the 
        sequence.<sup><a href="#note30">30</a> <a name="back30"></a></sup>Shreiber 
        is not alone in emphasising the negative strategies of <i>Love Songs</i>, 
        indeed Burke argues that they &#34;stage [an] inch by inch withdrawal from 
        language.&#34;<sup><a href="#note31">31</a> </sup>Ja<a name="back31"></a>net 
        Lyon goes further identifying what she describes as the &#34;absences&#34; in 
        the sequence as a crucial aspect of &#34;<i>the dialectical movement of negativity</i>&#34; 
        which is the &#34;focal point&#34; of <i>Love Songs</i>.<a href="#note32"><sup>32</sup></a><a name="back32"></a></span></font></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such 
        readings, although ostensibly demonstrating Loy&#39;s radical revisiting of 
        avant-garde practice, do suggest that <i>Love Songs</i> (and other pieces) 
        manifest a lack or insufficiency of language and articulation. This viewpoint 
        ultimately consigns Loy to a realm of silence, a realm beyond the <i>Symbolic</i> 
        which is often, almost stereotypically, cast as the space of the feminine.&#34; 
        In contrast I would wish to emphasise the excess of meaning in Loy&#39;s poetry, 
        including <i>Love Songs</i>, which demonstrates a mode of expression that 
        utilises the visual and the implicit in addition to not instead of the 
        semantic. Such profusion of signification is coterminous with the multiplicity 
        of the uncertain speaking subject, as well as being closely identified 
        with immanence and mutuality (the &#34;opulent well-being&#34; that the &#34;Human 
        Cylinders&#34; refuse to aspire to, perhaps). Thus, what Marjorie Perloff 
        describes (albeit in a different context) as Loy&#39;s use of &#34;the grim advantage 
        of what we might call negative identity,&#34;<sup><a href="#note33">33</a></sup> 
        I w<a name="back33"></a>ould recast in a much more positive and enabling 
        light as a tactical and indeed empowering employment of a multiple, duplicitous 
        voice, a subject-in-process not fixed either into the rigid authority 
        of (confessional) truth or the antithetical absolutes of a dialectic. 
        Loy&#39;s texts, such as <i>Love Songs</i>, which produce an uncertain speaking 
        subject are actually emancipatory in a much more sophisticated and ultimately 
        more progressive mode than the clarion call of her &#34;Feminist Manifesto&#34; 
        or &#34;Parturition.&#34; By exploring her contingent stance as (woman) author 
        through her texts themselves, Loy&#39;s poems offer the possibility of liberation 
        from the ideological boundaries of gender and identity without denying 
        or negating the physical actualities of existence (as a woman), and without

style='font-size:12.0pt'>This letter, in which Loy also, self-consciously and 
        ironically, invokes the example of Sappho for her <i>Love Songs</i>, would 
        appear to establish &#34;To You&#34; as the tributary preface to Loy&#39;s sequence 
        of modernist love-lyrics, and this is the motivation behind Conover&#39;s 
        grouping of the poems in his earlier edition of Loy&#39;s work <i>The Last 
        Lunar Baedeker</i>. However, Conover omits the poem from <i>The Lost Lunar 
        Baedeker</i> and admits that &#34;[Marisa] Januzzi has persuaded me that despite 
        ML&#39;s plea to CVV [...] I may have taken this request too literally in 
        LLB. I now find it difficult to read &#34;To You&#34; as a prelude to &#34;Songs to 
        Joannes,&#34; either thematically or structurally.&nbsp;(<i>LLB</i> 191) Conover&#39;s 
        caution is correct, and it is certainly misleading to read &#34;To You&#34; as 
        a simple &#34;dedicatory poem [...] an elusive evocation of the loved one 
        in the context of the city.&#34;<sup><a href="#note36">36</a></sup></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address 
        of &#34;To You&#34; does imitate the conventions of the ahistorical, apolitical 
        romantic lyric, in which the loved one (You) is invoked to facilitate 
        an expression of the speaker&#39;s state of mind (I). However, a literal interpretation 
        of Loy&#39;s poem and comments ignores the allocutory complexity of &#34;To You.&#34; 
        There is no straightforward beloved, either real or imagined at the receiving 
        end of Loy&#39;s apostrophe.&#34; As Peter Quartermain highlights, the syntactic 
        drift of this piece, which inaugurates the liberating discontinuities 
        of <i>Love Songs</i>, acts against any singularity or linearity of interpretation.<a href="#note37"><sup>37</sup></a> 
        <a name="back37"></a>The line-breaks which disrupt the semantic groupings 
        of &#34;To You&#34; produce an uncertain grammatical subject, and the prepositions 
        which structure the poem highlight the relational activity of the piece. 
        Thus, not only can we recognise the act of writing as an actual production 
        (rather than representation or deferral of meaning), but we are also witness 
        to a textual production of a relational subject. Although &#34;You&#34; is/are 
        addressed and invoked, this postulated third person (the text, the writing, 
        the subject) of the poem is the writer herself. As in her <i>Love Songs</i>, 
        Loy undermines the egocentric poetic tradition that uses the Other, the 
        addressee, the beloved, the woman, to enable a solipsistic self-exploration.&#34; 
        By placing herself as both addresser and addressee, as speaker and silent/silenced 
        listener, Loy offers a textual examination of her unauthorised status 
        as active, literary voice. In its questioning of poetic convention, &#34;To 
        You&#34; introduces the subversive tendencies and equivocal voice of the <i>Love 
        Songs</i>. </span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The name &#34;Stephen&#34; represents masculine authority with 
        a nexus of autobiographical and cultural implications. Stephen is Loy&#39;s 
        first husband (Stephen Haweis) who resented and restricted her development 
        as an artist and writer. But he is also Stephen Daedelus, the prototypical 
        modernist artist of Joyce&#39;s <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> 
        (1914-15), or his mythical precursor Saint Stephen, the original martyr. 
        In appropriating author-ity from &#34;Stephen&nbsp;, Loy establishes herself as 
        &#34;hybrid,&#34; offering a defiant doubleness which exceeds the restrictions 
        of dualistic ontology or oppositional aesthetics. The &#34;You&#34; of the poem 
        violates the boundaries of purity and control, offering, instead, a blurring 
        of the distinctions between subject and object, self and other, author 
        and audience. Thus, the cross-breed also crosses borders, trespassing 
        on the traditional prerogative of (male) author-ity, and infringing the 
        self-containment of the authorial voice.</span> </font>

        mixed heritage that Loy explores in her sequence <i>Anglo-Mongrels and 
        the Rose</i>: a linguistic, intellectual, and cultural hybridity that 
        comes to form a fundamental aspect of her aesthetic. In <i>Anglo-Mongrels 
        and the Rose</i> (first published between 1923 and 1925) Loy poses her 
        &#34;auto-mythological&#34; self Ova as a &#34;mongrel&nbsp;girl of Noman&#39;s land.&#34;<a href="#note38"><sup>38</sup></a><sup>

        racial and social outsiders undermines the supposed &#34;purity&#34; and superiority 
        of Western culture and its artistic expression. This is not simply a rhetorical 
        stance but lies at the heart of Loy&#39;s aesthetic vision. Hybridity results, 
        for Loy, in a re-invigoration of culture. Against the paralysing purity 
        of form and expression Loy offers her own multilingual poetic vocabulary, 
        celebrating the &#34;composite&#34; &#34;living language&#34; of America in an article 
        on &#34;Modern Poetry&nbsp;.<a href="#note40"><sup>40</sup></a> Inde<a name="back40"></a>ed, 
        the lexical hybridity of Loy&#39;s writing has served some critics as the 
        defining element of her work.&#34; In this context Perloff notes Loy&#39;s &#34;curious 
        polyglossia&#34; and finds it to be a distinct mark of her modernist poetic, 
        one which foreshadows the current multiplicities of &#34;English&#34; throughout 
        the world.<sup><a href="#note41">41</a></sup> This <a name="back41"></a>echoes 
        Jim Powell&#39;s earlier assessment of Loy and Basil Bunting which points

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span

          continental Renaissance and after, and more recently by imperial imports 
          from throughout the world. Loy and Bunting have created poetic voices 
          which can draw comfortably on all the registers of English, from the

        also function to regulate the modernist transgressor and impede the communication 
        of his/her specific individuality. This precarious position can produce

        above commotion&#34; that &#34;Frays to tow&#34; (ll. 29, 30), emphasising the instability 
        of the written word and presenting Truth as a balancing act. Loy chooses 
        not to mourn the passing of absolute truth and authority, so that her 
        carnivalesque figuring of the crisis of representation is in stark contrast 
        to the parsimonious edifice against chaos that Eliot constructs in <i>The 
        Waste Land</i>; &#34;These fragments I have shored against my ruin.&#34;<sup><a href="#note44">44</a></sup> 
        <a name="back44"></a>What Loy suggests is that the writer occupies a performative 
        space from which a variety of authorial poses can be presented, poses 
        which often seek to disguise the contingency of their origins in an assertion 
        of complete agency and control. Rather than adopting the armour of personae, 
        as Pound and many other modernists do, or writing with a customary detachment, 
        a dis-acknowledgment of self which is the tactic of much of Marianne Moore&#39;s 
        work, Loy &#34;seems to reject any coherent model of the self as something 
        both imaginary and conventional,&#34; as Peter Nicholls describes it, reformulating 
        &#34;modernist irony&#34; so that the &#34;reflexivity of her style turns the force 
        of the critique back upon the self.&#34;<a href="#note45"><sup>45</sup></a> 
        In<a name="back45"></a> &#34;To You,&#34; as elsewhere, Loy seeks to expose the 
        masquerade of the author through her own modernist performance which inserts 
        itself into, and subverts, the dominant discourse of the avant-garde. 
        With an incongruous blurring of reality and metaphor that parodically 
        re-enacts the literalising metaphors of racism, sexism, and masculinism, 
        the addressee of the poem, Loy as writer, presents her own equivocality 
        and textually situates herself within &#34;y[/]our mask of unborn ebony/And 
        the silence of y[/]our harangue.&nbsp;(ll. 27-28)</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is the city, as the form of the modern, which offers 
        a depersonalised audience to the performance and reinscribes the doubleness 
        of the text. In <i>Love Songs</i> Loy metonymically presents the simultaneous 
        internal/external perception of self (self as observer and observed) through 
        the eye/I homonym, which is also crossed with physical-spiritual enlightenment 
        (eye/light/enlightenment). In a similar nexus of associations the city 
        presents an illuminated/illuminating vacuity from/in the reflecting windows/eyes 
        of its gaze: &#34;Lit cavities in the face of the city/Open their glassy embrace 
        to receive you.&#34;(&#34;To You&#34; ll. 25-26) The self is both confirmed and dispersed 
        in the soul(lessness) of the metropolis. In the final lines of &#34;To You&#34; 
        Loy restates her position as silenced alien, offering it as an inevitable 
        product of the crisis of modernity. The poem returns to the &#34;stain&#34; of 
        race, but also suggests the equalising power of miscegenation as racial 
        and textual uncertainty. The ambivalence of origins destroys hierarchy 
        as it destroys legitimacy, producing an unbounded potentiality which Loy 
        implies both linguistically (&#34;levelling&#34;) and typographically, with the 
        openness of a final dash:</span> <span

        the writer, addressing her self as (a) speaking subject. The poem breaks 
        boundaries and orthodoxies and accepts an alien nature that is paradoxically 
        both a disadvantaged state and an inevitable and enabling role.&#34; As a 
        &#34;dedication&#34; to <i>Love Songs</i> this subterfuge enunciates Loy&#39;s position 
        as authorial voice against and beyond the weight of tradition and authority. 
        It is through such tactics that Loy&#39;s unique positioning vis-a-vis modernism 
        can be recognised. What her work productively explores are the contingencies 
        of language, expression, and (modern) culture, enabling the outsider to 
        speak (through) the arbitrary relations of modernity. The incongruous 
        gap in the text of modernism that so many writers attempt to fill or bridge 
        with models of linguistic precision, impersonality, stylistic self-sufficiency, 
        gender ideology, and so on, is the inter-zone that Loy explores and exploits. 
        This inter-zone is uncertain and duplicitous, and here the transgressor 
        risks annihilation while resisting co-option into the realms of authoritative/authoritarian 
        &#34;Truth.&#34; But, for Loy as artist, Anglo-Jewish expatriate, mother, modernist, 
        woman, it is the fertile space from which and of which her complex, exceptional,

        The appellation &#34;Dusie&#34; originated in Loy&#39;s year studying art in Munich 
        (1900) where she was given this nickname because of her confusion over 
        the formal and informal second person pronouns <i>Du</i> and <i>Sie</i>. 
        The name is used by Loy in her early 1910s Florentine correspondence and 
        by Mabel Dodge and Carl Van Vechten in their memoirs of the period. Burke

        DuPlessis reads &#34;two intertwined narratives&#34; in <i>Love Songs</i>, an 
        &#34;intellectual analysis of the<sup> </sup>amorous failings of these highly 
        developed intellectuals, whose precepts and experiences don&#39;t<sup> </sup>match&#34; 
        and &#34;her extreme rage and grief that she does not have his child, that 
        she did<sup> </sup>not get pregnant, or that pregnancy was not allowed 
        to happen, barred from happening by contraceptive practices, or even, 
        perhaps, aborted,&#34;(DuPlessis, 275). She goes on to argue,<sup> </sup>using 
        Loy&#39;s call for a feminist maternity in the &#34;Feminist Manifesto,&#34; that 
        Loy employs the<sup> </sup>reproductive justification of sex to facilitate 
        a non-oppositional definition of female sexuality. DuPlessis&#39; analysis, 
        although somewhat dependent on biographical speculation and a literalisation 
        of the reproductive tropes of <i>Love Songs</i>, is not incompatible with 
        my own understanding of Loy&#39;s revaluation of the creative female through

'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some critics 
        have found Loy&#39;s use of racial tropes, particularly conceptions of &#34;the 
        negro,&#34; problematic but there is no space to enter fully into this debate 
        here&nbsp;Marisa Januzzi is perhaps indicative when she writes of Loy&#39;s &#34;Widow&#39;s 
        Jazz&#34; that &#34;[h]er thematic and aesthetic appropriation of the &#39;negro&#39;&nbsp;body, 
        &#39;soul&#39;; and dialect&nbsp;may well seem dated and problematic; indeed Loy&#39;s time-bound 
        use of the trope of the&#39;Negro primitive&#39;threatens to eclipse the symbolic 
        significance of the imagery in the context of the poem as a whole,&#34; Januzzi, 
        &#34;Mongrel Rose: The&#39;Unerring Esperanto&#39;of Loy&#39;s Poetry&nbsp;, <i>Mina Loy: 
        Woman and Poet</i>, 437. However, rather than a typical modernist exploitative 
        and/or Eurocentric notion of the &#34;primitive&#34; as an unmarked, originary 
        culture, I would argue that Loy&#39;s work expresses a continuity with, not 
        an appropriation of, African-American Jazz culture or the Jewish immigrant 
        worker. These displaced, dispossessed, and hybridised cultures and peoples 
        represent the truly modern for Loy; instances of dislocation and contingency 
        which cannot belong to or in traditional forms but who are, ultimately, 
        the voice of the modern world. Januzzi&#39;s circumspection does not prevent 
        her from celebrating the &#34;challenging implication&#34; of Loy&#39;s work which 
        appears very close to the crucial strategy that the present article has 
        discovered in &#34;To You&#34; and <i>Love Songs</i>; &#34;[t]he elusive location 
        of the self in the fertile, generative material of language itself.&#34;(437)
