        and exists in various versions, having been subject to successive revisions, 
        and rendering a reliable chronology of unpublished writing almost impossible. 
        Moreover, autobiography and fiction blur, as she tells and retells her 
        story by means of self-mocking inventions and re-inventions of the self. 
        Not only was she Mina Lowy, Mina Loy, Ducie or Dusie Haweis, Mrs. Arthur 
        Cravan or Mina Lloyd to those who knew her, but she playfully employed

        of its publication. The earliest poems to appear in print were those published 
        by the New York small presses, when Loy posted handwritten drafts from 
        Florence to Carl Van Vechten. At this distance, it was impossible to avoid 
        editorial and typesetting errors. For example, in an undated letter thanking 
        Van Vechten for his article in <i>Rogue</i> (August 1915), she asks, “By 
        the way who is the hero who taps my spelling?” In another letter which 
        she wrote upon receiving the copy of the July 1915 issue of <i>Others</i> 
        (in which the first four “Love Songs” appeared for the first time), she 
        observed:</span> </font>

        corrections in April 1917, when <i>Others </i>devoted a whole issue to

        named “Pig-Cupid” and “Love Song No.1” reappeared in the 1982 anthology 
        <i>Last Lunar Baedeker </i>(the misspelling of which was itself a further 
        case of contingent renaming in the history of this <i>oeuvre</i>).<a href="#note3">3</a>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="back5"></a>The 
        indeterminate and provisional nature of the work was exacerbated partly 
        by such editorial inconsistencies and partly by her own resistance to 
        preset forms and closures. That textual variants and discrepancies might 
        sometimes be part of a deliberate strategy is suggested by the inclusion 
        of a list of tenets which she wrote in 1918 under the title of “Psycho 
        Democracy”<a href="#note6">6</a>: <a name="back6"></a>“Most movements 
        have a fixed<b> </b>concept toward which they advance, we move away from 
        all fixed concepts in order to advance.”(<i>LLB</i> 278) In her own words, 
        her writing was “tentative—intermittent—unfinishing.” Even here she uses 
        the present continuous—“unfinishing”—not “unfinished.” Features such as 
        gaps, dashes and syntactical anomalies, the use of idiosyncratic vocabulary, 
        including antiquated or rare forms of words, all serve to draw the reader’s 
        attention to formal (or informal) qualities of the writing, and put into 
        question the notion of the text as an autonomous entity which provides 
        unmediated access to a “real” world. They serve to emphasise the nature 
        of the poem as the site of ideological and psychological conflict where 
        contradictions and tensions remain unresolved.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
        aspect of the indeterminacy which surrounds Loy and her work is the misdating 
        of certain of her texts and paintings. Roger Conover asks: “When she misdated 
        her paintings, was she anticipating our posthumous eavesdropping and intentionally 
        throwing us off the track?”(<i>LLB</i> xviii) An answer to this question 
        is suggested by a particularly notable textual<b> </b>misdating, which 
        occurs on the original handwritten version of the poem ‘An Aged Woman’ 
        in which she writes:“[T]he past has come apart/events are vagueing/the 
        future is unexploitable.” This poem, the reflections of an old woman close 
        to death, is startlingly signed, “Mina Loy, July 12th 1984” (as if from 
        the grave, since Loy died in 1966). Like Conover, one is tempted to ask 
        whether this interference with time is deliberate playfulness in anticipation 
        of our “posthumous evesdroppings,” or a manifestation of amnesia on the 
        part of the elderly poet whose past had indeed begun to “come apart.”</span> 
        </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loy’s 
        deceptions have served her purpose of defying the constraints which are 
        enmeshed in language itself. When Colossus, the young hero in <i>Anglo-Mongrels 
        and the Rose,</i> declares that “All words are lies,” he expresses Loy’s 
        personal mistrust of language, her awareness of the way in which seemingly 
        transparent words are axiologically encoded. In particular, she called 
        into question the prevailing sexual ideologies of her time. In keeping 
        with the precepts of her confrontational “Feminist Manifesto” of 1914, 
        her writing is the assertion of her own status as a woman experimentalist 
        in the predominantly male communities of avant-garde artists and writers 
        within which she lived for much of her life. Although work is inextricably 
        linked to the subversive and iconoclastic activities of the Italian Futurists, 
        New York Dada and French Surrealists, her poetry also constitutes a challenge 
        to them, one which was specifically grounded in gender. The anxiety which 
        she experienced with regard to the oppressive constraints of patriarchy 
        upon her own subjectivity — constraints which manifest themselves in works 
        such as <i>Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose</i> and the unpublished<i> Islands 
        </i>and<i> Goy Israels</i>—is perhaps what she refers to when she says 
        that “this Book, constitutes my inhibition.” That is, having responded 
        to the imperative to contest patriarchy, once reified in a text, the very 
        fixity of the writing becomes, in itself, problematic. This may even explain, 
        in part, her compulsion to repeated revisions of the work.  </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 
        Loy often adopts the revolutionary mode of the historical avant-gardes 
        among whom she lived and worked, and challenges the wider artistic and 
        cultural economies which the movements were themselves defying, she simultaneously 
        challenges some of the precepts of those same movements. Indeed, certain 
        of her early poems offer specific response to contemporary Futurist texts. 
        For example, the poem “One O’Clock at Night”(1915) engages satirically 
        with Marinetti’s “scorn for women” as expressed in <i>War, the World’s 
        Only Hygiene</i>.<a href="#note7">7</a><a name="back7"></a> Her poem begins, 
        “Though you had never possessed me/I had belonged to you since the beginning 
        of time.”(<i>LoLB</i> 15) The division of self (the independent “me”) 
        and other (the passive “I”) exemplifies the kind of internalised debate 
        which is a significant feature of much of Loy’s work. A Bakhtinian confrontation 
        takes place between an autonomous “me” who is “never possessed” in the 
        first line, and the acquiescent “I” of the second line, the voice of woman 
        described by the Futurist as “the tragic trinket, the fragile woman.”<a href="#note8">8</a> 
        This<a name="back8"></a> second voice speaks with a “sideways glance” 
        at her male companion, and at the Futurist discourse of misogyny which 
        exerts its own energy as it infiltrates the language of the poem. As well 
        as the <i>intra</i>subjective debate between “active” self and “passive” 
        other, there is also the <i>inter</i>subjective confrontation between 
        the woman poet and the Futurist. This ironic and mocking intonation, whereby 
        opposing views are contained within the same utterance, is what Bakhtin 
        referred to as “double voiced discourse.” </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
        lines which follow, the poet addresses the Futurist directly, adopting 
        her allotted role, “purely animal,” and simultaneously distancing herself 
        from it by means of irony:</span> </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>And sleepily I sat on your chair beside you</span> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><br>
          Leaning against your shoulder<br>
          </span>And your careless arm across my back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gesticulated<br>
          As your indisputable male voice   roared<br>
          <span

          <span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Arguing dynamic decomposition<br>
          </span>Of which I understand nothing.  (<i>LoLB</i> 15) </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The gaps in the typography serve to stage the verbs which 
        follow (gesticulated and roared) by isolating and so amplifying them. 
        These gaps also self reflexively provide an example of “dynamic decomposition” 
        of which the poet denies all knowledge. This halting quality is a characteristic 
        of Bakhtin’s concept of the “sideway’s glance,” as the poetic voice mockingly 
        anticipates the criticism or reaction of the “indisputable” male voice.

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In “One 
        O’Clock in the Morning” the poet contests through irony the Futurist polemic 
        which, according to Marinetti, woman “without knowing it…is intimately 
        sure of being, as a mother, as a wife, and as a lover, a closed circle, 
        purely animal and wholly without usefulness.”<a href="#note9">9</a> In 
        <a name="back9"></a>the final lines of this poem, the thinking poet confronts 
        her own double, the sexual woman. The opposing drives of “animal” sexuality 
        and intellectual thought are both aroused by the bombastic futurist discussion, 
        variously described in a mildly amused tone as “cerebral gymnastics,” 
        the “self-indulgent play of children” and “thunder of alien gods.”</span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1920, 
        Loy returned to Florence after a four year absence. Here she encountered 
        the explosive atmosphere in which an intense power struggle was taking 
        place on the streets between Socialists, moderate Nationalists, and gangs 
        made up of loose associations of Fascists, <i>Arditi</i> and Futurists. 
        That she had, by this time, become profoundly disillusioned with Marinetti's 
        belligerence and with the Futurists’ enthusiastic participation in war 
        is apparent from the manifesto “Psycho-Democracy,” which was written in 
        1918 and published privately in Florence in 1920.<a href="#note10">10</a> 
        Here <a name="back10"></a>she expresses her personal cynicism concerning 
        the nationalisms which had contributed to the bloodshed of World War I, 
        and in contrast to Marinetti's description of war as “the world's only 
        hygiene,” describes military conflict as “the cataclysmic factor in social 
        evolution.”(<i>LLB </i>280)  In the poetry written during this period, 
        she throws down the gauntlet to Marinetti by manifestly employing the 
        symbolist tropes to which he had so loudly declared his bitter aversion 
        in the manifesto “We Abjure our Symbolist Masters, the Last Lovers of 
        the Moon.”<a href="#note11">11</a> His <a name="back11"></a>hatred of 
        the nostalgic poetry of Poe, Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Verlaine, and of  
        the so called “debilitating” influence of woman, was the ammunition with 
        which he had earlier mounted an attack on his rival in literature and 
        politics, the symbolist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. The sensuality and romantic 
        sentimentality of Symbolism had provided the necessary antithesis against 
        which his own belligerence and aggression could be defined. He dissociated 
        Futurism from the language of Symbolism and, in the process, condemned 
        what he called the “enfeebling” influence of D’Annunzio, “lesser brother 
        of the great French Symbolists, nostalgic like them and like them hovering 
        above the naked female body.” Since it was precisely as a woman that Loy 
        contested Futurism, it was therefore appropriate that she should do so 
        by an assertion of symbolist tropes.  </span> </font>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two poems

        these poems and Laforgue’s “<i>Climat, Faune et Flore de la Lune</i>,” 
        identifying Loy’s attraction to the Laforguian use of exotic and polysyllabic

          Baudelaire and Laforgue. “Lepers of the moon,” the public’s hostile 
          epithet, recalls Laforgue’s pierrots with “La coeur blanc/tatoue/De

        “Lunar Baedeker” satirises those decadents referred to by Marinetti and 
        described by Kouidis as moon-struck escapists. She writes, “The poem recreates 
        their exotic lunar refuge in a décor of Decadence shaped by gilded words 
        and images, and lush patterns of sound.”<a href="#note16">16</a>  <a name="back16"></a>Kouidis 
        discusses the manner in which the employment of Laforguian imagery of 
        death and decay in “Lunar Baedeker” provides a critique of an outworn 
        poetic language (according to Loy, ‘in the museums of the moon’) and of 
        those artists who seek escape from the world in “lunar” flights from reality. 
        This reading does not, however, go far enough, since such a critique would 
        coincide with the disdain of Marinetti and the Futurists for those to 
        whom he refers ironically as “our Symbolist Masters.” However, there are 
        a number of ironic references in “Lunar Baedeker” which suggest that Loy’s 
        barbs are aimed not so much at the language of Symbolism as at Marinetti 
        himself. In 1909, the year in which they first became acquainted, Marinetti 
        had published an extravagant  Futurist fantasy entitled “Let’s Murder 
        the Moonshine,” in which a horde of Futurist artists sets out to “lay 
        the great military Railroad to the flanks of Gorisnakar, summit of the 
        world!” He writes: </font></span> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span

          prudent counsellors? To their vacillating lives, broked by dismal agonies, 
          by fearful dreams and heavy nightmares, we prefer violent death and 
          glorify it as the only thing worthy of man, that beast of prey.</span></font></p>

        the language of death and decay—“infusoria,” “tombstones,” “ashes,” “Necropolis,” 
        “mildews”—to project her own vision into what Marinetti had referred to 
        as the “fearful dreams and heavy nightmares” of these despised women. 
        There is an incantatory quality in the combination of the polysyllables 
        in “cornucopia,” “somnambulists,” and “hallucinatory,” together with the 
        alliterative clustering of consonants in lavish phrases such as “Peris

        weapon of death, electricity generated by “gigantic wheels,” is parodied

        Her relationship to both Futurism and, later, Surrealists exemplified 
        what Susan Suleiman has referred to a “double allegiance,” whereby women 
        writers who are drawn to the formal and cultural radicalism of predominantly

          to the history of the avant-garde in poetry, prose and the visual arts, 
          there are also elements odd and perhaps unassimilable there, even at 
          a moment when we have come to recognize a plurality of competing modernisms.

        her place at the margin of the margins and her work was neglected as a 
        result. Luce Irigaray in <i>This Sex Which is Not One</i> might have been 
        speaking of Loy's slippery and elusive opus when she wrote of woman that: 
        “One must listen to her differently in order to hear an ‘other meaning’ 
        which is constantly in the process of weaving itself, at the same time 
        ceaselessly embracing words and yet casting them off to avoid becoming
