          but not in the usual way, which subverts a particular kind of genre, 
          has a sense of wit or irony, is honest but not na&iuml;ve, but is also 
          direct, surprising, vital and graceful. The press is especially interested 
          in work in which the writing, the page and the form of the book are 
          in dynamic relation.<br>

          Empathy in the TV Coverage of the World Trade Center Attack</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          TV images of the World Trade Center burning were horribly familiar yet 
          they stood without parallel. Black smoke billowed from both buildings 
          and I thought I saw a free-falling body twist its way past the gaping 
          hole in Tower One. Yet the studio voices that accompanied the images 
          did not mention it. Had they not seen him or her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>TV anchors, some calm, some excited, repeated that a plane had 
          crashed into the North Tower, then hit the second one. It was live footage 
          of real buildings burning in real time, but they stood silent, with 
          no natural sound, at the surreal distance evoked by long camera shots. 
          As I watched, another explosion tore through the second tower and flames 
          silently consumed a lower portion of the building. The only frame or 
          reference for such images is the fictional narratives of computer-generated 
          action films in which cities are mutilated and destroyed. Independence 
          Day, one such cartoon-like adventure, demolished New York and Washington, 
          the very cities I now watched burning.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our 
          perceptions have been permanently framed by the sensibilities of those 
          commanding fictions, and TV practitioners are certainly under the sway 
          of the techno-hyper-real. It seemed as if we were living through Life 
          the Movie. These events had already happened and this was some sort 
          of spectacular sequel. Openly awed by the visual spectacle, &#8220;it 
          was quite a sight,&#8221; one intoned. Some awareness, just below the 
          level of waking, continued to nag at my reception of the pictures, aren&#8217;t 
          there people in the buildings? The TV voices were not helping even as 
          they recounted, over and over, the actual events. A pilot on a remote 
          phone connection with Channel 4 had seen, &#8220;the plane screaming 
          by at full power.&#8221; By the time he looked out his apartment window, 
          about 4 or 5 seconds later, it had hit Tower One. As he spoke the buildings 
          burned benignly against the sky of the clear September day. Though there 
          was emotion in his voice, it was hard to bring actual human beings into 
          this zone that was essentially fictional, uniquely visual, and usually 
          without real consequences. After all, we didn&#8217;t mourn for the 
          thousands who died in Independence Day. But didn&#8217;t I just see 
          someone, an actual person&#8217;s body falling to the ground?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
          people we did hear from were the ones already out of harm's way Eyewitnesses 
          told how they had fled the building. A misguided sense of responsibility 
          might have prevented reporters from attending to those still inside. 
          Was it some desire to prevent mass hysteria? Later that night, when 
          I finally got through to my friends in SoHo, I heard their sorrow at 
          seeing dozens of people crowded at the windows on the floors with no 
          exit routes. A man very near the top had waved a white cloth through 
          a broken window for at least 45 minutes. He never got out. After 7 hours 
          of watching television, I had not heard any such stories. Whatever the 
          reasons, television did not see fit to allow us to grieve for the people 
          left trapped in the building at the time it went down. We will never 
          be able to have that collectively summoned moment of silence they all 
          deserved.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There 
          was much concern for the NewYork skyline. At Newark airport one journalist 
          pointed a camera over the tails of a fleet of United jets to find empty 
          sky, where this morning he told us, we would have seen the World Trade 
          Center. Throughout the day TV openly lamented the loss of the buildings, 
          yet the fact that people lay buried under the rubble was almost never 
          mentioned. One police officer requesting anonymity estimated losses 
          in the thousands. Whether the media decided for themselves, or simply 
          followed official admonitions, the effect was the same. One journalist 
          actually used the term &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; for those killed, 
          diminishing the humanity of those lost.<span

        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A 
          New Yorker covered in soot ran down the street. He came in and out of 
          the frame, and as he did I could see his lips move but the sound was 
          off. The studio voices were always laid over the images, they interpreted, 
          explained, but never let me hear the people on the street. Some considered 
          media worthy were brought into the studio or moved out of the direct 
          action and interviewed, but only short snippets of what they said were 
          aired. We were told that a storeowner was giving out water, but I did 
          not see such meaningful moments.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to be with my fellow New Yorkers, sharing their struggles 
          for survival, and grieving for the ones lost. Instead, there was the 
          endless repetition of the most dramatic images. In addition to The Towers 
          Burning were images reminiscent of other movies including, Armageddon; 
          clouds of dust and rubble billowing from between the buildings, pursuing 
          people running away in the street. Repeating the picture over and over 
          with no sound removed it from real experience and turned it into a fascination. 
          By days end one of the newsmagazines had produced a slick sequence molded 
          into familiar entertainments, &#8220;doctors and interns lined up like 
          on a set of a disaster movie.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I 
          didn&#8217;t want to be a detached observer, awed by the spectacle, 
          entertained by cleaver references, calmed by the stories deemed appropriate 
          by gatekeepers. I wanted to be a thinking, feeling citizen, part of 
          a human community pulling together in a crisis. I wanted local reporters 
          in the streets getting the story on the ground. By the next day, local 
          news was doing just that, giving out help-line numbers, reporting on 
          family members searching for loved-ones, and in general being good citizens.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This 
          disaster has no frame of reference adequate for its expression and able 
          to grasp its meanings. The fictional frames are just that, entertainments. 
          We grasp for a way to express human dignity in the face of terrible 
          loss. We do have storylines and image conventions for death, ones applied 
          to people outside of our own communities. When the media air grizzly 
          pictures of famine, disasters, death and war elsewhere, they are usually 
          presented with little context, from a detached perspective: people crowded 
          together, under attack, starving, suffering horrible indignities. These 
          people are presented as the Other, through narratives of exclusion, 
          as little more than sights for our fascination. Ethical battles have 
          been fought, some won, some lost, about airing graphic depictions of 
          human horror. Many have been deemed too ratings worthy to be shelved. 
          We have no words, no media frames that can recognize the sadness of 
          death as it happens, while preserving the dignity of those it is happening 
          to. Media sensationalism often overcomes our feelings of empathy and 
          compassion. Are these the reasons we could not acknowledge that the 
          buildings were full of people?</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
          city is beginning to come to terms with the loss of life, as family 
          members search for those still missing and unaccounted for. No doubt 
          there are pictures and footage that we have not yet seen, of the horrible 
          events that occurred on Tuesday. More footage of the people who jumped 
          out of the buildings is starting to be aired. The audio track of screams 
          and chaos are beginning to accompany the repeated disaster footage. 
          Let us hope that these horrible sights don&#8217;t become the source 
          of revenue, or ratings boosters when commercials make their way back 
          on to our television screens. Hopefully we will now be more aware of 
          the need for empathy and compassion when we tell stories of death, loss 
          and destruction, not only for ourselves, but also for those who find 
          themselves in front of our cameras in other parts of the world.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>

        The film footage is wobbly and blurry but stunning: A soccer stadium in 
        <br>
        Afghanistan is packed with people, but there is no match today. Instead,<br>
        a pickup truck drives into the stadium with three women, shrouded in<br>
        burqas, cowering in the back. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Armed men 
        in turbans force a woman from the truck, and make her kneel at the penalty 
        line on the field. Confused and unable to see, the woman tries to look 
        behind just as a rifle is pointed against the back of her<br>
        head. With no fanfare whatsoever, she is shot dead. The shaky video<br>
        camera captures the cheering crowd as people rise to their feet, hoping<br>
        to get a better view of the corpse on the ground. The blue folds of the<br>
        burqa begin to stain red with blood. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This public 
        execution is some of the most shocking film ever seen on<br>
        television; it is perhaps the best document that the West has of<br>
        atrocities committed by the Taliban. It is just one part of an<br>
        astonishing hour-long documentary called &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot; 
        currently<br>
        in heavy rotation on CNN. Filmed by the half-Afghan British reporter<br>
        Saira Shah, who traveled undercover to Afghanistan last year, &quot;Beneath<br>
        the Veil&quot; neatly captures the horror of life under the Taliban--the<br>
        public executions for infractions as minor as prostitution or adultery, 
        <br>
        the brutality of fundamentalist police, the slaughter of civilians<br>
        unlucky enough to live on the front line of the civil war with the<br>
        Northern Alliance. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In documenting 
        life under the Taliban, Shah went into the homes of the<br>
        Afghan people and onto the battlefields, cleverly evading the<br>
        Department of Vice and Virtue, which would have thrown her in jail for<br>
        filming illegally (all unsanctioned filming is forbidden). She visited 
        <br>
        territory occupied by the Northern Alliance, and visited a village where<br>
        the Taliban had brutally murdered dozens of civilians just weeks<br>
        earlier-- a local wedding photographer had filmed the scene as<br>
        villagers buried rotting bodies that had been scalped and mutilated. <br>
        There, Shah also interviewed three teenage girls whose mother had been<br>
        shot dead by the Taliban. They were so traumatized by the atrocities<br>
        that the Taliban subsequently inflicted upon them that two of them<br>
        would no longer speak. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But some 
        of the most heartstopping footage in &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot;<br>
        including film of the execution of the women in the soccer stadium, was<br>
        captured not by Shah but by an Afghan underground organization which<br>
        assisted her in her work. Indeed, Shah's documentary would not have<br>
        been possible were it not for the Revolutionary Association of the<br>
        Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), an underground organization whose members 
        risk their lives every day in attempts to undermine the Taliban and publicize 
        its brutality. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">RAWA was 
        originally founded in 1977 as an Afghan feminist group<br>
        focused on women's rights, but its mandate broadened when<br>
        fundamentalists rose to power. Determined to expose the frightening<br>
        abuses of the Taliban, women in the group began to hide video cameras<br>
        under their burqa and document the executions and public floggings<br>
        which take place every day under the Taliban. They also smuggle female<br>
        journalists like Shaila Shah and Eve Ensler, writer/director of &quot;The<br>
        Vagina Monologues,&quot; into the country, in hopes of bringing attention<br>
        to their cause. In defiance of the Taliban's law forbidding education<br>
        for women, RAWA also runs clandestine home-based schools for girls; for<br>
        women, who are forbidden to work, RAWA teaches handicrafts and sells<br>
        them online. In the refugee camps in Pakistan, RAWA also provides<br>
        medical assistance, housing and education for impoverished and <br>
        terrified fugitives of Taliban rule. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">RAWA, the 
        most prominent Afghan-run organization to oppose the<br>
        Taliban, has become one of the fundamentalists' greatest enemies.<br>
        Perhaps the aspect of the group most infuriating to its opponents-- and<br>
        a surprising key to its effectiveness -- is that it consists entirely<br>
        of women, nearly 2,000 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, who use the cover<br>
        of their burqas and the seeming powerlessness of their status to<br>
        strategic advantage. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By traveling 
        with RAWA, Shah got a first-hand view of what it's like<br>
        to be a woman living under the Taliban, and she was invited into RAWA's<br>
        secret schools and illegal meetings. She also got access to its library<br>
        of video footage -- which includes not just the film of the execution<br>
        of the women, but footage of the public hanging of three men in the same<br>
        soccer stadium. (The soccer stadium was funded by international aid<br>
        groups who wanted to raise the spirits of the Afghan people; instead,<br>
        the Taliban is using it only for executions. One Taliban official told<br>
        Shah that if the aid groups felt that the stadium should be used for <br>
        soccer, they should build the Taliban an extra stadium for<br>
        executions.) &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; was filmed long before the attacks 
        of<br>
        Sept. 11, and, according to RAWA members, the situation in Afghanistan<br>
        has since become more dire. Because the borders between Pakistan and<br>
        Afghanistan have closed, the Afghan people are now trapped in their own<br>
        country-- enduring the oppressive rule of the Taliban while waiting<br>
        for U.S. bombs to drop from the sky. RAWA, meanwhile, says it is running<br>
        out of money and can't afford to educate, feed and treat the millions<br>
        of refugees massed along the border. The Pakistani police, which are<br>
        sympathetic to the Taliban, regularly target RAWA members; and since<br>
        communication with Afghanistan has been cut off, the RAWA members in <br>
        Pakistan know little about what is happening to their members across the<br>
        border. <br>
        <br>
        In a telephone interview from Islamabad, a 26-year-old member of RAWA, 
        identified only as &quot;Fatima,&quot; spoke about RAWA's work in Pakistan 
        and Afghanistan, its position on war and the Northern Alliance, and its<br>
        &quot;uncompromising attitude&quot; toward fundamentalism. A seven-year 
        veteran<br>
        of the group's dangerous brand of activism, Fatima is a member of the 
        <br>
        RAWA political committee that has been trying to rally both Afghan women 
        and the international media to its agenda. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        is your life story, and what do you do for RAWA? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. I'm from 
        Kabul. I started to work with RAWA when I was 19 years old.<br>
        There has been war in our country for more than 23 years; my generation<br>
        was born with war, we've experienced just crimes, just blackness, just<br>
        sorrow in our country. We never saw happiness or democracy. I lived in<br>
        shock, because every day there were tragic stories in my neighborhood<br>
        around me. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I was 
        young I decided to do something about this. A lot of young<br>
        girls commit suicide because they are helpless and hopeless. But some,<br>
        like me, choose the way of struggle. We accept that we want to serve<br>
        our people -- that this is the best way to bring justice to our country. 
        <br>
        When I was 20 years old, I left Afghanistan; my job for RAWA was to<br>
        come here to Pakistan and work in the refugee camps. I had to cross the<br>
        border often and go back into Afghanistan to organize women for<br>
        demonstrations; and to bring RAWA's publications into Afghanistan. We<br>
        would go secretly and without documents -- no one asks you for them <br>
        because you are a woman. I wear the burqa then, because this is the<br>
        only visa required for women to enter Afghanistan. When I<br>
        cross the border, no one can know that I am in RAWA. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Why do 
        you use the pseudonym &quot;Fatima&quot;? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A.We all 
        use different names all the time, because we have a lot of<br>
        security problems. Our leader Meena and her bodyguards were<br>
        assassinated in Pakistan in 987 by the Islamic fundamentalists and the<br>
        KGB. Our members are always attacked and injured -- we receive death<br>
        threats by e-mail and letters and telephone, telling us to stop what we<br>
        are doing or they will kill us. So we are working clandestinely in <br>
        Afghanistan, and in Pakistan we are half-secret. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Have 
        you ever been personally attacked by the Taliban?<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. I was 
        flogged three times in the streets, for stupid reasons. They<br>
        will flog women that don't have the veil on, or aren't with their male<br>
        relative, or are talking to a male shopkeeper, or are out on the<br>
        streets during the evening. There are always people sobbing in the<br>
        streets because they are being beaten. This is normal. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In Pakistan 
        in1999, I was injured at a RAWA demonstration. Pakistan<br>
        is one of the countries that officially recognizes the Taliban<br>
        government; so when we take our anti-Taliban slogans into the streets,<br>
        they try to stop us. During the demonstration, we were fighting -- we<br>
        wanted to go in front of the United Nations building; but the Pakistani<br>
        police wanted to stop us. During the fighting, they beat me and broke<br>
        my hand. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        has been RAWA's most crucial activity in Afghanistan? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We teach 
        hundreds of women and children in the underground schools in Afghanistan. 
        For children, we teach mathematics, physics, chemistry,<br>
        Persian, science, social studies and the history of Afghanistan; also,<br>
        the geography of the world. For women, we just teach them two main<br>
        subjects -- mathematics and Persian. When our women go to the shops,<br>
        they don't know how to pay the shopkeeper and get change, because they<br>
        haven't had an education. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We also 
        bring in video cameras to expose the crimes of the Taliban.<br>
        It's risky work. We filmed the execution of the women that you saw in<br>
        &quot;Beneath the Veil.&quot; Also, we've filmed hangings in Kabul and 
        several<br>
        other cities, taken pictures of Afghans who have had their hands cut<br>
        off for stealing, or their necks cut. There are photos on our Web site. 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We make 
        a hole in the burqa and film through it. That's why the<br>
        quality of our films is very bad; it's very difficult. No one has ever<br>
        been caught doing it; but execution is the only punishment if you get<br>
        caught, especially if the Taliban knew we were RAWA.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        are you doing in the refugee camps in Pakistan? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We have 
        schools for girls in the fugitive camps; but in some we have<br>
        problems because of the influence of the fundamentalists. We have<br>
        handicraft projects for women; we run chicken farms, a jam-making<br>
        business and carpet weaving projects. We also have mobile medical teams<br>
        that go in to the camps one or two days a week to give free medicine. 
        We<br>
        had a hospital called Malalai, but it closed because of our financial<br>
        problems; one of our very urgent projects is to reopen it. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        are your feelings about the attack on America? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We are 
        so sorry for the victims of this terrorist attack. We want to<br>
        shower them with deep solidarity. We can understand their sorrow because 
        we also suffered this terrorism for more than 23 years. We were already 
        victims of this tragedy. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On the other 
        hand, unfortunately, we warned the United States<br>
        government about this many, many times; as well as the other countries<br>
        that are supporting and creating the fundamentalist parties. They helped<br>
        create these terrorists during the Cold War; they supported Osama bin<br>
        Laden [during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan]. Fundamentalism is<br>
        equal to terrorism; it's equal to crime. We said, this germ won't just<br>
        be in Afghanistan, it will spread out all over the world. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Today we 
        can see this with our own eyes. We warned them but they never listened 
        to our cry, to our voice. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. How is 
        the crisis in America affecting your work at RAWA? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. Thousands 
        of families are escaping from Afghanistan, leaving everything behind because 
        they are afraid of war. Thousands of others that are living in Afghanistan 
        don't have the possibility to immigrate here; and now, even the borders 
        are closed. That means that our people have to burn in the flame of war 
        and all the doors are closed. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In fugitive 
        camps it's really hard to work, especially hard because<br>
        millions of fugitives have just arrived. They are in shock, and have<br>
        nothing but themselves and the clothes on their back. I met a family<br>
        yesterday that wanted help from RAWA, they cried and said they walked<br>
        through the mountains because the border was closed. Their child fell<br>
        down the mountain and died, but they couldn't stop because they had to<br>
        escape. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our people 
        escape from Afghanistan because of the fear of killing and<br>
        rape and torture, but they will die in the refugee camps because of lack<br>
        of food, jobs and healthcare. Even here the situation is not good. We<br>
        are in a crisis in the camps; thousands have contacted us for help and<br>
        we don't know how to help them. At every moment they want their children 
        to be in our orphanages or our schools; they want a house, medicine --they 
        need everything, and we have no money. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Also we 
        are so worried about our members inside Afghanistan, about<br>
        their lives. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Are you 
        concerned about a war with the United States? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We are 
        condemning an attack of the U.S. on Afghanistan, because it<br>
        won't be the Taliban but our people who will be the victims. The United<br>
        States should decry these terrorist groups in Afghanistan; but not<br>
        through an attack. Maybe through commando attacks, though. We do want<br>
        the United Nations to be more active -- their rule is very important in<br>
        this moment. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We also 
        want to convey a message to the American people that there's a<br>
        difference between the people of Afghanistan and the criminal government 
        of Afghanistan. There is a river of blood between them. <br>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Do you 
        support the Northern Alliance? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We condemn 
        the cooperation of the United States with the Northern<br>
        Alliance. This is another nightmare for our people -- the Northern<br>
        Alliance are the second Taliban. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Northern 
        Alliance are hypocrites: They say they are for democracy<br>
        and human rights, but we can't forget the black experience we had with<br>
        them. Seventy-year-old grandmothers were raped during their rule,<br>
        thousands of girls were raped, thousands were killed and tortured. They<br>
        are the first government that started this tragedy in Afghanistan. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        government do you support, then? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We are 
        ready to support the former king. It doesn't mean that the king<br>
        is a very ideal person for us. But in comparison to the fundamentalist<br>
        parties, we prefer him. The only condition we have for the king is that<br>
        he must not cooperate with the Northern Alliance. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What 
        does RAWA need right now? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We are 
        in a very bad financial condition. We need anything we can get<br>
        -- for our mobile team, for medicine, for our schools. Maybe $1 is<br>
        nothing for them, but for us it means a lot. To run our struggle with<br>
        empty hands is impossible for us. <br>

        It is hard for us to see the suffering, even from across the seas, even

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        have lived through war. We have been greatly helped in our recovery, by 
        the United States representatives, who talked against revenge and promoted 
        reconciliation as essential to achieve a future with true peace and democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        know what it is like to be attacked, to grieve and to feel anger. Every 
        day we attend to the physical and emotional pains of the women in our 
        communities who continue to suffer from the violence of war. We listen 
        to the stories and work together with women to find ways to productively 
        channel negative emotions. Women in Kosova, still suffering from the symptoms

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Therefore 
        we understand the urge for revenge is strong. And we know that it must 
        not be given in to. We know that a violent response can only bring more 
        violence. It does not bring justice. Instead it kills more innocent victims 
        and gives birth to new holy avengers. It begins a new cycle and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        that there is talk of attacking and putting at risk millions of people&#8217;s 
        lives because of the acts of a few. We do not wish to have war on a country 
        or countries full of innocent adults and children, who already suffer 
        at the hands of their leaders and whom themselves have committed no crimes. 
        We know that bombs are not smart, we know they kill women, children, and 
        old people and we know only too well, that it is mainly the women who 
        bear the task of rebuilding societies torn apart by war. This is our work 
        at present and it is very hard work. We do not wish to see countries' 
        economies devastated, and its people made poorer for generations to come. 
        We do not wish to see Americans attacked, killed or made afraid in the 
        United States because of their religious or ethnic identities. We wish

        Wills There Are No Winners</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is four weeks 
        since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Like most of us since 
        these attacks, I have been more aware of being alive as a gift. I have 
        reached out to loved ones to tell them I love them. And like most of us, 
        I am scared and wish I didn&#146;t feel so helpless. Because as I write, 
        the U.S. has started bombing Afghanistan. The bombing does not make me 
        feel safe. It makes me feel unsafe. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the radio 
        commentators remarked on the day the bombing started, apropos of the origins 
        of war, that the Vikings didn&#146;t have a word for the meaningless escalation 
        of violence that comprises the plot of the greatest Icelandic saga, Brennu 
        Njalsaga. Njal&#146;s Saga is the story of a wise man with an unwise family. 
        What starts out as a small retaliatory exchange between two households 
        escalates, despite Njal&#146;s best peacekeeping efforts, until two whole 
        clans are involved in the rivalry. At last Njal and all his household 
        are burned alive by their enemies. When the plot is reduced to its broad 
        outlines, the horror of the violence of killing so many people is writ 
        large (one of the themes of this saga). When we reduce the September 11th 
        attacks to the nineteen young Muslim fundamentalists--the sect is so sexist 
        we need not denote their sex--who highjacked four passenger airline jets 
        and killed over 6000 people in one hour, these terrorist acts seem to 
        us clearly mad. Crazy mad. The actions of lunatics. From our perspective. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Angry mad, from their 
        perspective. Why do they hate us? Americans asked after the attack. &#147;How 
        do people reach this level of anger, hatred and frustration?&#148; asks 
        Professor of Conflict Studies John Paul Lederach. To call them lunatics 
        misses a crucial point: By my experience, explanations that they are brainwashed 
        by a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is 
        an escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed 
        responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational, identity-based 
        anger, is constructed over time through a combination of historical events, 
        a deep sense of threat to identity, and direct experience of sustained 
        exclusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the terrorists&#146; 
        perspective, they are a David heroically fighting the bully-giant Goliath, 
        who is spreading Western imperialism. If we do as they expect, which is 
        to use our power against a weak people or nation, we can expect without 
        a doubt that they will engage in the future in ever-escalating cycles 
        of revenge and violence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Vikings in fact 
        did have a word for the senseless feuding that drives the plot of Njal&#146;s 
        Saga, which is the word used to rationalize the violence by the characters. 
        It is the same word as motivated the terrorists on September 11th, the 
        same word as is motivating U.S. and British retaliation. It is a word 
        for an heroic concept, a warrior&#146;s code. That word is honor, along 
        with the component parts of the ancient heroic code: pride and shame, 
        loyalty and betrayal. One of the men interviewed on the radio the day 
        we started the bombing was a veteran of the Gulf War. When asked if he&#146;d 
        go back to war if drafted, he said, &#147;Of course. It&#146;s the warrior&#146;s 
        code, to rip the living heart out of the enemy&#146;s chest. I&#146;m 
        a warrior.&#148; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Honor requires us 
        to retaliate, or the enemy will think he can get away with murder. But 
        honor, too, will require the other side to avenge such retaliation because 
        we &#147;deserved&#148; the punishing &#147;justice&#148;they dealt us. 
        At the dawning of the twenty-first century, we discover that we understand 
        the saga&#145;s world of the blood feud and violent retaliation because, 
        to our shock and horror, we are suddenly living it. However much we refuse 
        to hear them, from the Muslim extremist perspective, the U.S. has been 
        made &#147;to pay&#148; for past grievances to the Muslim world, for which 
        we had never shown remorse. Now, we are making Afghanistan &#147;pay&#148; 
        for harboring terrorists. But Afghanistan did not attack the U.S. So, 
        the U.S. will eventually be made to &#147;pay&#148; for its harming Afghanistan. 
        How far and how long will this exchange of violence go?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We desperately need 
        another model for what is deemed an honorable response. That model also 
        lies in Njal&#146;s Saga as well, in Njal himself. The saga was written 
        after Iceland had converted in 1000 A.D. to Christianity. Thus, although 
        its action takes place before the conversion, its theme is influenced 
        by gentler Christian tenets. Njal is a pagan precursor of what I will 
        call &#147;radical Christianity&#148; (to distinguish it from the bigotry 
        of most versions of fundamentalist Christianity, much like the terrorists&#146; 
        Islamic fundamentalism must be distinguished from the gentler Muslim faith). 
        Njal counsels tolerance and negotiates nonviolent alternative responses 
        to violence. He wheels and deals for peace. Although the violence of his 
        pagan family eventually takes him down with them, he represents an alternative 
        that redefines the heroic code of honor. We need that alternative now. 
        What are the possibilities?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a start, we could 
        redefine &#147;honor&#148; as being able to hear both sides, both perspectives, 
        not just our own. We could view violence itself as dishonorable, and every 
        &#147;holy war&#148;--both sides have bandied this phrase about--as sacrilege. 
        Certainly when we are the target, we call violence &#147;barbaric&#148;and 
        &#147;heinous.&#148; Why is it justified when we perpetrate it ourselves? 
        We could consider our own possible responses in terms other than violence. 
        And to those who say we will look weak to the world if we negotiate, we 
        could answer: We need another definition of strength. Strength is the 
        courage to wait and to make a considered response. Strength is not throwing 
        our military weight around. Strength is seeking insistently--and, why 
        not? aggressively--negotiated, diplomatic solutions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We need to honor 
        the memories of our own victims by listening to their families. Many of 
        the families of the September 11th dead are not calling for retaliation, 
        but for peacemaking. Touched so deeply and irrevocably by this tragedy, 
        these families understood more immediately than any of us that no violence 
        will return their loved ones to life, no retaliatory strike could suffice 
        to comfort them in their grief. They say again and again that their dead 
        would not wish other innocent people to die for their deaths. In escalating 
        the violence, we risk making the deaths of over 6000 civilians truly meaningless, 
        for we will have failed to understand the lesson in their deaths: that 
        how we feel now is how civilians in Baghdad felt when we bombed them, 
        how civilians in Serbia felt, how civilians in Japan felt. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is it not dishonorable 
        that we were indifferent to the pain we caused? We need to redefine honor 
        as caring about the consequences of our actions in the world, and as not 
        hypocritically mouthing the rhetoric of democracy when we take geopolitical 
        action. Not only should we care, because we can identify with grief felt 
        around the world. We must care--not as a rule of law, but as Barbara Kingsolver 
        puts it, as one of &#147;a hundred ways to be a good citizen, . . . to 
        look finally at the things we don&#146;t want to see.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        On September 11th our world changed. We Americans learned that we weren&#146;t 
        safe in our own country--whether we are warriors or peacemakers, whites 
        or people of color, men or women, gays or straights, legal or illegal 
        residents. All of us will suffer for the policies of the few in power. 
        But it doesn&#146;t have to be that way. This tragedy has produced a huge 
        awakening. We as a people have the opportunity now to change as well. 
        Instead of confirming the terrorists&#146; portrait of the U.S. as a bullying 
        superpower, we might still yet react unexpectedly, for example by beginning

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Language has been 
        on the feminist political agenda for years. It can't<br>
        just go away meekly now. It is agonizingly evident as of September 11 
        that<br>
        there has been a paucity of women's voices from the political arena (the<br>
        world over) as well as in the arena of high public culture and discourse.<br>

        missives of newsprint. But so few women. The talking head female folk 
        on<br>
        TV are a relief. Susan Sontag and Maureen Dowd are a relief but there 
        has got to be more female leadership and articulation and input into the 
        public discourse and decision-making apparatus. More mainstream illumination 
        from the hidden dakinis and durgas! &amp; more Amy Goodmans! Some alternative/corrective 
        resource to power of VOICE. How things are expressed, stated, conveyed 
        whether it be condolence, dissent, opinion--whatever the form or genre--needs 
        attention. US nation-wide surveys showed a marked difference of opinion 
        when it comes to issues of &quot;war&quot; &quot;education&quot; &quot;literacy&quot; 
        (&amp; we are, I hope, grateful that Laura Bush cares about books). We 
        need more THINKING by women aired and expressed on urgent issues. It is

        attempt to manipulate us? We've had in the not so distant past genteel 
        tyrannies of custom and practice. It was a crime under slavery for African 
        Americans to read and write. Remember when a woman couldn't vote? When 
        saying a liturgy or public oratory by women was forbidden? A certain ilk 
        of males have had a monopoly on NAMING WHAT COUNTS AS REALITY. This seems 
        more and more insane in a universe with infinite possibilities. It doesn't 
        need to be this way. Of course we understand that gender is a social construct

        &nbsp;The Challenge of Terror: A Traveling Essay <br>
        &nbsp;by John Paul Lederach</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So here I am, a week late arriving home, stuck between Colombia,<br>
        Guatemala and Harrisonburg when our world changed. The images flash even<br>
        in my sleep. The heart of America ripped. Though natural, the cry for<br>
        revenge and the call for the unleashing of the first war of this century, 
        prolonged or not, seems more connected to social and psychological processes 
        of finding a way to release deep emotional anguish, a sense of powerlessness, 
        and our collective loss than it does as a plan of action seeking to redress 
        the injustice, promote change and prevent it from ever happening again.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I am stuck from airport to airport as I write this, the reality of a<br>
        global system that has suspended even the most basic trust. My Duracell<br>
        batteries and finger nail clippers were taken from me today and it gave<br>
        me pause for thought. I had a lot of pauses in the last few days. Life<br>
        has not been the same. I share these thoughts as an initial reaction<br>
        recognizing that it is always easy to take pot-shots at our leaders from<br>
        the sidelines, and to have the insights they are missing when we are not<br>
        in the middle of very difficult decisions. On the other hand, having<br>
        worked for nearly 20 years as a mediator and proponent of nonviolent<br>
        change in situations around the globe where cycles of deep violence seem<br>
        hell-bent on perpetuating themselves, and having interacted with people<br>
        and movements who at the core of their identity find ways of justifying<br>
        their part in the cycle, I feel responsible to try to bring ideas to the<br>
        search for solutions. With this in mind I should like to pen several<br>
        observations about what I have learned from my experiences and what they<br>
        might suggest about the current situation. I believe this starts by<br>
        naming several key challenges and then asking what is the nature of a<br>
        creative response that takes these seriously in the pursuit of genuine,<br>
        durable, and peaceful change.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        SOME LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF OUR CHALLENGE<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        1. Always seek to understand the root of the anger - The first and<br>
        most important question to pose ourselves is relatively simple though<br>
        not easy to answer: How do people reach this level of anger, hatred and<br>
        frustration? By my experience explanations that they are brainwashed by<br>
        a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is an<br>
        escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed<br>
        responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational,<br>
        identity-based anger, is constructed over time through a combination of<br>
        historical events, a deep sense of threat to identify, and direct<br>
        experiences of sustained exclusion. <br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is very important 
        to understand, because, as I will say again and again, our response to 
        the immediate events have everything to do with whether we reinforce and 
        provide the soil, seeds, and nutrients for future cycles of revenge and 
        violence. Or whether it changes. We should be careful to pursue one and<br>
        only one thing as the strategic guidepost of our response:<br>
        Avoid doing what they expect. What they expect from us is the lashing<br>
        out of the giant against the weak, the many against the few. This will<br>
        reinforce their capacity to perpetrate the myth they carefully seek to<br>
        sustain: That they are under threat, fighting an irrational and mad<br>
        system that has never taken them seriously and wishes to destroy them<br>
        and their people. What we need to destroy is their myth not their people.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        2. Always seek to understand the nature of the organization - Over<br>
        the years of working to promote durable peace in situations of deep,<br>
        sustained violence I have discovered one consistent purpose about the<br>
        nature of movements and organizations who use violence: Sustain thyself.<br>
        This is done through a number of approaches, but generally it is through<br>
        decentralization of power and structure, secrecy, autonomy of action<br>
        through units, and refusal to pursue the conflict on the terms of the<br>
        strength and capacities of the enemy.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One of the most 
        intriguing metaphors I have heard used in the<br>
        last few days is that this enemy of the United States will be found in<br>
        their holes, smoked out, and when they run and are visible, destroyed.<br>
        This may well work for groundhogs, trench and maybe even guerilla<br>
        warfare, but it is not a useful metaphor for this situation. And neither<br>
        is the image that we will need to destroy the village to save it, by<br>
        which the population that gives refuge to our enemies is guilty by<br>
        association and therefore a legitimate target. In both instances the<br>
        metaphor that guides our action misleads us because it is not connected<br>
        to the reality. In more specific terms, this is not a struggle to be<br>
        conceived of in geographic terms, in terms of physical spaces and<br>
        places, that if located can be destroyed, thereby ridding us of the<br>
        problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly our biggest and most visible weapon 
        systems are<br>
        mostly useless.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We need a new metaphor, 
        and though I generally do not like<br>
        medical metaphors to describe conflict, the image of a virus comes to<br>
        mind because of its ability to enter unperceived, flow with a system,<br>
        and harm it from within. This is the genius of people like Osama Ben<br>
        Laden. He understood the power of a free and open system, and has used<br>
        it to his benefit. The enemy is not located in a territory. It has<br>
        entered our system. And you do not fight this kind of enemy by shooting<br>
        at it. You respond by strengthening the capacity of the system to<br>
        prevent the virus and strengthen its immunity. It is an ironic fact that<br>
        our greatest threat is not in Afghanistan, but in our own backyard. We<br>
        surely are not going to bomb Travelocity, Hertz Rental Car, or an<br>
        Airline training school in Florida. We must change metaphors and move<br>
        beyond the reaction that we can duke it out with the bad guy, or we run<br>
        the very serious risk of creating the environment that sustains and<br>
        reproduces the virus we &gt;wish to prevent.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        3. Always remember that realities are constructed -<br>
        Conflict is, among other things, the process of building and sustaining<br>
        very different perceptions and interpretations of reality. This means<br>
        that we have at the same time multiple realities defined as such by<br>
        those in conflict. In the aftermath of such horrific and unmerited<br>
        violence that we have just experienced this may sound esoteric. But we<br>
        must remember that this fundamental process is how we end up referring<br>
        to people as fanatics, madmen, and irrational. In the process of<br>
        name-calling we lose the critical capacity to understand that from<br>
        within the ways they construct their views, it is not mad lunacy or<br>
        fanaticism. All things fall together and make sense. When this is<br>
        connected to a long string of actual experiences wherein their views of<br>
        the facts are reinforced (for example, years of superpower struggle that<br>
        used or excluded them, encroaching Western values of what is considered<br>
        immoral by their religious interpretation, or the construction of an<br>
        enemy-image who is overwhelmingly powerful and uses that power in<br>
        bombing campaigns and always appears to win) then it is not a difficult<br>
        process to construct a rational world view of heroic struggle against<br>
        evil. Just as we do it, so do they. Listen to the words we use to<br>
        justify our actions and responses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And then listen to 
        words they use. The way to break such a<br>
        process is not through a frame of reference of who will win or who is<br>
        stronger. In fact the inverse is true. Whoever loses, whether tactical<br>
        battles or the &quot;war&quot; itself, finds intrinsic in the loss the 
        seeds that<br>
        give birth to the justification for renewed battle. The way to break<br>
        such a cycle of justified violence is to step outside of it. This starts<br>
        with understanding that TV sound bites about madmen and evil are not<br>
        good sources of policy. The most significant impact that we could make<br>
        on their ability to sustain their view of us as evil is to change their<br>
        perception of who we are by choosing to strategically respond in<br>
        unexpected ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take enormous courage and courageous<br>
        leadership capable of envisioning a horizon of change.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        4. Always understand the capacity for recruitment-The<br>
        greatest power that terror has is the ability to regenerate itself. What<br>
        we most need to understand about the nature of this conflict and the<br>
        change process toward a more peaceful world is how recruitment into<br>
        these activities happens. In all my experiences in deep-rooted conflict<br>
        what stands out most are the ways in which political leaders wishing to<br>
        end the violence believed they could achieve it by overpowering and<br>
        getting rid of the perpetrator of the violence. That may have been the<br>
        lesson of multiple centuries that preceded us. But it is not the lesson<br>
        from that past 30 years. The lesson is simple. When people feel a deep<br>
        sense of threat, exclusion and generational experiences of direct<br>
        violence, their greatest effort is placed on survival. Time and again 
        in<br>
        these movements, there has been an extraordinary capacity for the<br>
        regeneration of chosen myths and renewed struggle.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One aspect of current 
        U.S. leadership that coherently matches<br>
        with the lessons of the past 30 years of protracted conflict settings 
        is<br>
        the statement that this will be a long struggle. What is missed is that<br>
        the emphasis should be placed on removing the channels, justifications,<br>
        and sources that attract and sustain recruitment into the activities.<br>
        What I find extraordinary about the recent events is that none of the<br>
        perpetrators was much older than 40 and many were half that age.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is the reality 
        we face: Recruitment happens on a sustained<br>
        basis. It will not stop with the use of military force, in fact, open<br>
        warfare will create the soils in which it is fed and grows. Military<br>
        action to destroy terror, particularly as it affects significant and<br>
        already vulnerable civilian populations will be like hitting a fully<br>
        mature dandelion with a golf club. We will participate in making sure<br>
        the myth of why we are evil is sustained and we will assure yet another<br>
        generation of recruits.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        5. Recognize complexity, but always understand the power of<br>
        simplicity - Finally, we must understand the principle of simplicity. 
        I<br>
        talk a lot with my students about the need to look carefully at<br>
        complexity, which is equally true (and which in the earlier points I<br>
        start to explore). However, the key in our current situation that we<br>
        have failed to fully comprehend is simplicity. From the standpoint of<br>
        the perpetrators, the effectiveness of their actions was in finding<br>
        simple ways to use the system to undo it. I believe our greatest task 
        is<br>
        to find equally creative and simple tools on the other side.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Suggestions<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In keeping with the 
        last point, let me try to be simple. I<br>
        believe three things are possible to do and will have a much greater<br>
        impact on these challenges than seeking accountability through revenge.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        1.&nbsp; Energetically pursue a sustainable peace process to the<br>
        Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Do it now. The United States has much it<br>
        can do to support and make this process work. It can bring the weight 
        of<br>
        persuasion, the weight of nudging people on all sides to move toward<br>
        mutual recognition and stopping the recent and devastating pattern of<br>
        violent escalation, and the weight of including and balancing the<br>
        process to address historic fears and basic needs of those involved. If<br>
        we would bring the same energy to building an international coalition<br>
        for peace in this conflict that we have pursued in building<br>
        international coalitions for war, particularly in the Middle East, if 
        we<br>
        lent significant financial, moral, and balanced support to all sides<br>
        that we gave to the Irish conflict in earlier years, I believe the<br>
        moment is right and the stage is set to take a new and qualitative step<br>
        forward.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Sound like an odd 
        diversion to our current situation of terror?<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I believe the opposite is true. This type of action is precisely<br>
        the kind of thing needed to create whole new views of who we are and<br>
        what we stand for as a nation. Rather than fighting terror with force,<br>
        we enter their system and take away one of their most coveted elements:<br>
        The soils of generational conflict perceived as injustice used to<br>
        perpetrate hatred and recruitment. I believe that monumental times like<br>
        these create conditions for monumental change. This approach would<br>
        solidify our relationships with a broad array of Middle Easterners and<br>
        Central Asians, allies and enemies alike, and would be a blow to the<br>
        rank and file of terror. The biggest blow we can serve terror is to make<br>
        it irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing we could do is to feed it<br>
        unintentionally by making it and its leaders the center stage of what 
        we<br>
        do. Let's choose democracy and reconciliation over revenge and<br>
        destruction. Let's do exactly what they do not expect, and show them it<br>
        can work.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;2. Invest financially in development, education, and a broad<br>
        social agenda in the countries surrounding Afghanistan rather than<br>
        attempting to destroy the Taliban in a search for Ben Laden. The single<br>
        greatest pressure that could ever be put on Ben Laden is to remove the<br>
        source of his justifications and alliances. Countries like Pakistan,<br>
        Tajikistan, and yes, Iran and Syria should be put on the radar of the<br>
        West and the United States with a question of strategic importance: How<br>
        can we help you meet the fundamental needs of your people? The strategic<br>
        approach to changing the nature of how terror of the kind we have<br>
        witnessed this week reproduces itself lies in the quality of<br>
        relationships we develop with whole regions, peoples, and worldviews. 
        If<br>
        we strengthen the web of those relationships, we weaken and eventually<br>
        eliminate the soil where terror is born. A vigorous investment, taking<br>
        advantage of the current opening given the horror of this week shared 
        by<br>
        even those who we traditionally claimed as state enemies, is immediately<br>
        available, possible and pregnant with historic possibilities. Let's do<br>
        the unexpected. Let's create a new set of strategic alliances never<br>
        before thought possible.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;3. Pursue a quiet diplomatic but dynamic and vital support of<br>
        he Arab League to begin an internal exploration of how to address the<br>
        root causes of discontent in numerous regions. This should be coupled<br>
        with energetic ecumenical engagement, not just of key symbolic leaders,<br>
        but of a practical and direct exploration of how to create a web of<br>
        ethics for a new millennium that builds from the heart and soul of all<br>
        traditions but that creates a capacity for each to engage the roots of<br>
        violence that are found within their own traditions. Our challenge, as 
        I<br>
        see it, is not that of convincing others that our way of life, our<br>
        religion, or our structure of governance is better or closer to Truth<br>
        and human dignity. It is to be honest about the sources of violence in<br>
        our own house and invite others to do the same. Our global challenge is<br>
        how to generate and sustain genuine engagement that encourages people<br>
        from within their traditions to seek that, which assures the<br>
        preciousness and respect for life that every religion sees as an<br>
        inherent right and gift from the Divine, and how to build organized<br>
        political and social life that is responsive to fundamental human needs.<br>
        Such a web cannot be created except through genuine and sustained<br>
        dialogue and the building of authentic relationships, at religious and<br>
        political spheres of interaction, and at all levels of society. Why not<br>
        do the unexpected and show that life-giving ethics are rooted in the<br>
        core of all peoples by engaging a strategy of genuine dialogue and<br>
        relationship? Such a web of ethics, political and religious, will have<br>
        an impact on the roots of terror far greater in the generation of our<br>
        children's children than any amount of military action can possibly<br>
        muster. The current situation poses an unprecedented opportunity for<br>
        this to happen, more so than we have seen at any time before in our<br>
        global community.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        A Call for the Unexpected<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Let me conclude with simple ideas. To face the reality of well<br>
        organized, decentralized, self-perpetuating sources of terror, we need<br>
        to think differently about the challenges. If indeed this is a new war<br>
        it will not be won with a traditional military plan. The key does not<br>
        lie in finding and destroying territories, camps, and certainly not the<br>
        civilian populations that supposedly house them. Paradoxically that will<br>
        only feed the phenomenon and assure that it lives into a new generation.<br>
        The key is to think about how a small virus in a system affects the<br>
        whole and how to improve the immunity of the system. We should take<br>
        extreme care not to provide the movements we deplore with gratuitous<br>
        fuel for self-regeneration. Let us not fulfill their prophecy by<br>
        providing them with martyrs and justifications. The power of their<br>
        action is the simplicity with which they pursue the fight with global<br>
        power. They have understood the power of the powerless. They have<br>
        understood that melding and meshing with the enemy creates a base from<br>
        within. They have not faced down the enemy with a bigger stick. They did<br>
        the more powerful thing: They changed the game. They entered our lives,<br>
        our homes and turned our own tools into our demise.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        We will not win this struggle for justice, peace and human dignity <br>
        with the traditional weapons of war. We need to change the game again.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Let us take up the practical challenges of this reality perhaps<br>
        best described in the Cure of Troy,&nbsp;&nbsp;an epic poem by Seamus 
        Heaney, to<br>
        loosen the grip of the cycles of terror. Let us give birth to the<br>
        unexpected.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So hope for a great sea-change<br>
        On the far side of revenge.<br>
        &nbsp;Believe that a farther shore<br>
        &nbsp;Is reachable from here.<br>
        Believe in miracles<br>
        And cures and healing wells.<br>

        The email exchange, below, came out of an immediate and urgent need to 
        respond to recent terrorist events in the U.S. As members of the How2 
        Editorial Advisory Board began, spontaneously, to share their thoughts 
        with each other, it seemed clear that this sudden blow to our human psyche 
        had swiftly become the CENTRAL condition around which all thought/feeling 
        was flowing in us--privately and communally--and that in order to make 
        the How2 "postcard" email exchange relevant to our readers--to even imagine 
        anyone wishing to use it, at this moment--we would need to keep it deeply 
        connected to issues we are all worried about & thinking over within "the 
        continuous present" of writing. This may include the location of suppressed 
        questions that are not necessarily coming up in pre-defined and socially-pressured 
        public discourses (classrooms, bars, dinner tables, TV or radio shows--to/in 
        which we are witness &/or participant).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Excerpts from these 
        initial communiques have been put together, below, as both witness and 
        invitation to our readers to participate in this exchange of questions 
        and perspectives. One can imagine, for example, postcards from readers 
        who are teaching, describing useful written projects (with sharing of 
        selected results)-- ways of finding & making of written language acts 
        for overwhelming states of fear, grief, confusion or political scepticism.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">.... I am terrified, 
        numb, & aghast at my lack of language at this time. I want to explore 
        that feeling of lack. I feel deep rage about the discourse that is bombarding 
        us -- the military machine of cowboy rhetoric, the "dead or alive" bravado, 
        the ubiquitous image of the flag -- despair that I have no discourse to 
        oppose to it. No symbol to wear or hang from the windows, one that would 
        express grief & solidarity w/o yoking those to a jingoistic & hysterical 
        patriotism. I am enraged that an Islamic friend has stopped wearing her 
        head scarf for fear of her safety. That a colleague tells me that all 
        his dark-skinned, dark-haired students have shaved their beards & cut 
        their hair -- for safety. That the Morrocan family that runs 2 restaurants 
        in our neighborhood has the biggest & most plenteous flags at their establishments 
        -- for safety. I am enraged at the absence of a counter-symbol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I am grief-stricken 
        to hear the stories of a student who was trampled by the fleeing crowds, 
        who walked in bare feet all the way home to Queens, volunteered to take 
        blood donations for several days with no sleep or respite, & was then 
        yelled at in the subway for being "middle-eastern looking." Of another 
        who works fielding phone calls from the families of those missing & could 
        not control her sobbing. In a classroom. In that place. In that place 
        of words. I am appalled by their tears, I am exhausted, I am appalled 
        by my presence before them, I am speechless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I am stricken anew 
        this morning with the news that one of my students died in the attack. 
        She worked at a financial firm. I am appalled that she was at work while 
        I was at home. That for the last four years she was slowly earning her 
        BA in one evening course at a time. That this evening I must tell her 
        classmates</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am in NYC too. 
        The city where I was born. I was on 7th Ave. and Greenwich Street when 
        one of the buildings collapsed and there was only the sound of thousands 
        of us in the street gasping as it tumbled. Our own human sound louder 
        than the structure's rumble. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....On Thursday 
        night, I went to the opening of a friend's art show. It was the opening 
        of her first major solo show and had been in the works for over a year. 
        Many of us attended just to see each other. I arrived at the space in 
        far west Chelsea (which can look like a war zone on the best of days) 
        to see my friends wearing surgical masks in the absolutely toxic smoke. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But it was important 
        to see my friend's paintings. To see the attempt. Something good and full 
        of intention. Later in the week I was talking to this same painter friend 
        and she expressed disappointment that her show had gone ahead as very 
        few people have attended since that night and it is her first big show. 
        Then she began crying, saying, "why should I worry about something so 
        stupid?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> That is what it 
        has been like for me here. Feeling the fear (evacuated twice from locations 
        which were threatened after Tuesday), feeling shocked, ashamed, exhausted, 
        heartsick (walking past thousands of flyers with pictures of the "lost" 
        lining 11th Street all the way to St. Vincent's hospital) and then ricocheting 
        to concerns about the trivial and banal. Why can't I get below 14th Street 
        to the apartment where I am staying and get clean underwear? Why is this 
        bank line taking so long? Why did the woman put so much milk in my coffee 
        when I asked for "just a little?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....My friend David 
        just phoned to see if I was going to a peace march tomorrow in Union Square. 
        I said, "Yes." He asked if I was bringing a sign but I have no sign to 
        bring. Nothing clever to say. Not one thing. I am so sad. People in the 
        street are sad and quiet here. No music blaring out of bodegas, no excited 
        conversation, not even many children yelling and playing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....I feel really 
        sad. And to offer my deepest condolences to any of you who have been touched 
        personally in this tragedy. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">.... I was struck 
        by the fact that both Elizabeth Frost and Jo Ann Wasserman wrote about 
        their difficulty to define, to express, to find adequate words and symbols, 
        which now lie broken and useless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I think we should 
        try to find those words and symbols again (where? in the past? in ourselves? 
        in other cultures? should we create brand new ones?). Not logos, trademarks, 
        labels, slogans, badges, banners, allegories of death...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ...but, rather, 
        metaphors, words to cope with reality, attempts to understand and resist 
        interpretations--EVEN theories ("theory" being the 'bad' word few want 
        to hear in times of crises). But lack of theory is bad theory, and we--the 
        world--can't afford such a lack now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ...I&#8217;m trying to 
        express how these recent disasters have changed our relation to language. 
        Think of definitions given in the past few days: terrorist attack, permanent 
        global war, Holy War... (none of them seems proper)... and how everyone 
        is trying to cope with this void of language, working out responses that 
        generate from internal (psychological, but also physiological), external, 
        socio-cultural variations. Now those responses are floating and opaque; 
        sometime later they'll harden into definitions (the making of History). 
        I think that's a good reason for us to be watchful and keep on writing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And 'as life goes 
        on' I can't avoid thinking about the dozens of petitions I have signed 
        for years in defense of Afghan women, to expose their inhuman condition: 
        I wonder where those petitions landed, what we are to do for the forgotten 
        words.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....Let's keep on 
        writing about what is going on (inside, outside: is there a difference?)...striving 
        to find words to express it, to give a shape to these fragmentations.</font>

        from Jo Ann Wasserman / NYC In response to Renata Morresi</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In response to Renata 
        Morresi, I agree that theory must move forward and is critical to our 
        sorting out process as we receive so much incorrect and non critical information 
        from the agents of mass media in the States. We certainly need sensitive 
        and revolutionary thinking right now. One thing that I was struck with 
        while attending the peace march last night was the insistent use (on the 
        part of the demonstrators) of dualistic language&#8212;"Bush wants war, New 
        York wants peace!" or "justice: yes, war: no!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> My friend and I 
        tried to start a round of "we feel scared" and "dignity for humanity" 
        (doesn't scan well, I know) to no avail. If theory and critical discourse 
        could help us to move outside of binary thinking (or defining) as that 
        which we are against, rather than for, it would be transformative. What 
        I want is to be defined as FOR something, not always against. Even in 
        listening to the chant, "Peace not war," I wondered, "what does peace 
        mean right now?" The way things were on September 10th in New York City 
        as thousands of people woke up living on the street? The way things were 
        in Macedonia last year? On the Gaza Strip today? In the Sudan? In Pakistan?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Last Tuesday night 
        I felt like there was no place to go and feel "safe" for the night. It 
        is a strange feeling for me but I know many around the world and in the 
        States experience that all the time. A thought flashed through my mind&#8212;I 
        wished it was New Year's Day so that I could attend the big, 24 hour marathon 
        poetry reading which takes place at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church 
        in New York City every year. I wanted to be there partly to be around 
        friends but also to be in a space of hearing poems, nonstop. I have been 
        thinking about the place poetry has in a situation like this one. How 
        the mysterious nature of that language might also be part of a response. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yesterday I heard 
        that On October 3rd there will be a group reading by about 50 poets (many 
        of whom are also critical writers) at St. Mark's. The idea is to respond 
        to recent events here. I don't know what people will read or say but I 
        am eager to find out. If anyone will be in NYC and wants specific info., 
        I would be happy to e-mail it out. </font></p>

        / Sydney, AU & Pennsylvania </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">....I have been thinking 
        about the strength of words and the strength of a symbol like the flag--there 
        may be little or no appropriate words at this time but there have been 
        plenty of flags. Flags have long been a potent symbol of solidarity and 
        mourning. I think back to how Cathy Freeman carried the Aboriginal flag 
        in both Olympic games, symbolically reminding all in Australia and the 
        rest of the world of her history and Aboriginal Australians' continuing 
        presence. Her gesture was far more effective than any sentence she might 
        have spoken. And it seems to me, that for many Americans, the American 
        flag has had a similar function at this point of time. I'm not suggesting 
        here that a minority Australian proudly showing her 'colour/s' to the 
        world (while her country's government still fails to acknowledge or say 
        'sorry' for past injustices) is the same as an average American showing 
        the flag in his/her own yard. But that the flag is an outward sign or 
        gesture of solidary, gesturing in the American case a sympathy towards 
        those most affected by the events of 9/11.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At the same time, 
        I also find it dissettling. I am now constantly reminded that I am an 
        "alien" in the United States, that as a sign of solidarity, it excludes 
        me. I've noticed too that many have begun wearing ribbons in the colours 
        of the flag in the same way as there were AIDS ribbons, and apparently, 
        Gulf war ribbons. As a symbol, I think the ribbon, like the flag, focuses 
        on it being an "American" tragedy, that it elides the many non-Americans 
        who died in the World Trade Center collapses and the suffering of their 
        families. I realize that the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were 
        targets precisely because they were American icons, but in reinforcing 
        it as simply an American tragedy, the use of the flag or its colours as 
        a symbol merely encourages the objectives of such terrorism--to heighten 
        national and cultural divisions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I think new approaches 
        to combatting terrorism must go beyond, as Jo Ann suggests, a simple dialectic 
        of peace vs. war, to some global coalition of the "civilized" against 
        an unknown other. More importantly, to actually rethink what the very 
        basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what it might 
        mean to be human today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How to relate this 
        to writing, I'm less sure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Lastly, I just wanted 
        to say how much I appreciated Renata's timely email about modernist writers 
        working through issues of politics and aesthetics in the face of fascism. 
        A different, though related set of issues, certainly arises in relation 
        to terrorism. Both, I think, are different again than the questions arising 
        in the face of a slow, sanctioned genocide such as occurred with the Holocaust, 
        arguably also happening in other parts of the world today. </font></p>

        Frietag / Potsdam, Germany</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am still confused, 
        and yet feel that I should finally somehow contribute to our exchange 
        about the terrible events of 2 weeks ago, even if I am relatively far 
        away in Germany, and have no one close in New York. Although my original 
        speechlessness has given way (had to give way) to efforts to talk with 
        my kids, my family, my friends, and colleagues, I am feeling a complete 
        inability to balance and to connect emotional and rational responses in 
        an acceptable way. I cannot manage this balancing act between (the expression 
        of) complete devastation, sadness, compassion, and helplessness on the 
        one hand, and an analysis of the political, historical, social, and religious 
        context on the other. But I am sure that it is this balancing act that 
        is most urgently needed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is needed because 
        the one without the other does not hold, or rather is extremely one-sided 
        if not dangerous. In Germany, at present, next to the hands on anti-terrorist, 
        measure-taking approach (be assured of U.S.anti-terrorist military support 
        + more police: cameras, security checks, screening etc.), the emotional 
        discourse (in words, gestures, actions, and symbols--all very material), 
        is the officially sanctioned one...as long as it is "for the U.S. not 
        against them." Hence my daughter and her classmates talked for hours in 
        class about the events per se, without any background information on Afghanistan, 
        Bin Laden, and/or the Middle East, but when a fellow student raised one 
        question about U.S. policy in the region, he was reprimanded and, for 
        the rest of the lesson, overlooked by the teacher who threatened to bring 
        him before the headmaster. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That two-thirds of 
        the former East German citizens--who have experienced their share of offical 
        binary interpretations of history and current events--are strongly opposed 
        to a war (on Afghanistan or any other "villain state") is mostly interpreted 
        as the expression of an insufficiantly developed sense of democracy and/or 
        latent anti-Americanism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Yesterday the culture 
        section of my local newspaper opened with a one page article on "The Cowardly 
        Thinking," claiming that German "artists and intellectuals flee into anti-American 
        prejudices." What the diverse intellectuals quoted there (in bits and 
        pieces, completely out of context) have done is: to put the events--in 
        Washington, New York and the Pittsburgh area--into a wider context of 
        US policy plus voicing the same fears of race hatred, vicious patriotism, 
        and militant jingoism that have been expressed in our e-mail discussion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The erronous logics 
        of a terrorism which takes the symbols of US global power (the World Trade 
        Center, the Pentagon) as material representation of the "evil" ("US imperialism") 
        and hence aggressively destroys them, is cynically repeated in a counter-attack 
        scenario (prescribed by the Bush government and followed by its allies, 
        Germany among them) which takes the very same symbols as material representation 
        of the "good" ("democracy", "civilization") as those to be aggressively 
        defended. It seems to me that the arbitrariness of symbols, the contextual 
        differences of meaning, the contingency of positions--historical, political, 
        social, gendered, ethnic, class-related--and the ambivalence of emotions 
        needs urgently to be thought about, talked about, written about before 
        and while re/acting to what undoubtedly was an onslaught on humanity, 
        a terrible, inhuman act.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is especially 
        hard to make (perceive and create an awareness of) a difference, or rather 
        to make differences in writing (the use of words and symbols) that subvert 
        the simplifying dominant discourse, when this very discourse is so emotionally 
        charged. And yet these differences need to be made, thought, spoken, and 
        written--risking the judgement of "cowardly thinking," rather than not 
        thinking at all.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>excerpt from Linda 
        V. Russo / Buffalo</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">.... What makes sense 
        is to continue to assemble a life in the aftermath. The writing is such 
        an assembly, though it is never "after" but current, and a current we 
        ride to--where? Directions don't make sense now. Every direction is suspect.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I'm in Buffalo, 
        on the US/Canadian border. The day after 9/11 I tried to take a walk along 
        the Niagara River (our border) to find the otherwise well-trafficked area 
        all but empty except for scattered Vet-types with binoculars trained north.... 
        My co-ambulator and I were advised against walking on the pier, which 
        had been my desire, because of a bomb threat to the Peace Bridge that 
        runs above it on over to Canada. It was eerie, we felt unsafe, and we 
        left. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We felt unsafe for 
        the next three days and never parted company, except to go to classes, 
        to teach, which was almost fruitless--on Thursday I cried, looking out 
        onto the tiny sea of my students to take attendance, just glad that they 
        were there. They were sobered, and we went on--I teach composition--and 
        learn we did. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> .... Basically, 
        I've been thinking, how would How2, if she could talk, want the Forum 
        to function? This is where we interpret her "constitution." While on the 
        one hand I value hearing intelligent women-poetry-thinkers critically 
        address all manner of issues--I love especially the way this forum, email, 
        lets those issues evolve, accelerate--I wonder how can this be brought 
        forward in a way that's true to How2's urgencies--to poetry and women? 
        And yet, oddly, Ann's suggestion that we need to "actually rethink what 
        the very basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what 
        it might mean to be human today" really urges me.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Perhaps that's not 
        so odd, though, when one considers how poetry is being cast about amidst 
        all the rhetoric of memorial and war in the U.S.. According to National 
        Public Radio, to be human and male is to write Poetry; to be female is 
        to talk and to grieve. Our only nationwide forum for news and culture, 
        NPR has brought poetry to the foreground, in the voices of Billy Collins, 
        Robert Pinsky, and, today, W.S. Merwin, offering profound reflection and 
        dour sentiments. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women, when they 
        form audible words, sound in untrained yet eloquent prose. These are the 
        wives left behind. What NPR forms is an apparently unbridgeable sexually-differentiated 
        cultural divide. At what point do contemporary women enter to define a 
        national/poetic response? We stand, like Greek women outside the gates 
        of the polis, mourning. Olson said to Carolee Schneeman when she went 
        out to Gloucester with her then partner in the late 60s, that it was when 
        the cunts began to speak that Greek tragedy began its decline. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Anne Carson's fascinating 
        essay "The Gender of Sound" illuminates: "Greek women of the archaic and 
        classical periods were not encouraged to pour forth unregulated cries 
        of any kind within the civic space of the polis or within earshot of men. 
        Indeed, masculinity in such a culture defines itself by its different 
        use of sound." I've often wondered what stake male poets have/had in "masculinizing" 
        their practice, keeping it pure of certain (read "feminizing") emotions. 
        I'm not essentializing here (women write "emotional" poetry), but just 
        noticing how the burden of emotion is often pushed onto women while at 
        the same time this burden is used as an excuse to prohibit women's cultural 
        production, where culture is seen to proceed in a rational, or in some 
        sense formalized, manner.</font></p>

        Greenberg / Boston </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two issues I face 
        here and now: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1) Spinning off of 
        Linda Kinnahan's remarks about what it means to be an innovative writer 
        who is also political: How to be a non-narrative poet in the face of such 
        REAL, linear surreality, you know? I don't even WANT to write about it 
        all, but it's the only thing I AM writing about, in one way or another, 
        and I feel slightly irresponsible for going sideways/non-linear rather 
        than being directly story-telling about it all. To this end, I am planning 
        to read Celan, whom I think of as a brilliant avant-garde reporter of 
        very direct and personal tragedy. Can anyone suggest other poets who have 
        done this, especially women poets?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 2) I am also thinking 
        a lot about what it means to be a global citizen. I am not so naive as 
        to think that America can or should pull out of all foreign policy...at 
        this point that's simply not realistic, nor is it generous. So how can 
        a country like the USA use its power for good instead of evil? How can 
        I be a part of urging it to do so?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I want to also note, 
        in regard to Linda K's comment about Pinsky (whom I almost always find 
        self-righteous), that I did hear a pretty good alternative to the voice 
        of HIStory when Boston's NPR call-in show, "The Connection," had a day 
        dedicated to the uses of poetry at times like these, and guests were Marie 
        Howe and Naomi Shahib Nye.... One of my favorite moments on that show 
        was when the (male) host brought Nye on the line, and instead of either 
        Howe or Nye addressing the questions at hand-- or the host--Nye said, 
        "Hello, Marie, I have been thinking of you in New York" and Howe said, 
        "Hello, Naomi darling, I have been thinking of you." Such a human--and, 
        dare I say, female--moment.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Dear all<br>
        I have been reading your thoughtful messages with gratitude, and with 
        admiration for such articulate reflections. Many of the sentiments expressed 
        echo my own--in particular my feelings of frustration and powerlessness--but 
        I am made hopeful by the determination of everyone involved in this correspondence 
        to make sense of their lives, and to plan for future action--be it the 
        re-reading of Celan, the writing of new poetry, the raising of issues 
        in HOW2, or meeting up at the Modernism conference. (I wish I could be 
        there). Ann's suggestion for the rethinking of 'what the very basis of 
        being civilized might mean...what it might mean to be human today' ties 
        in with my own concern regarding our (my) lack of understanding of how 
        such inhumane acts come to be perpetrated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I was in China on 
        the 11th, in an area where we unable to receive CNN News, or indeed any 
        other English-speaking channel. Rumours abounded, and to see the TV images 
        with no commentary or explanation was terrifying. I rang my daughter in 
        London, and she told me what she knew of events. As we spoke, news reports 
        were coming in on her TV from the USA. She told me that a White House 
        spokesman was about to appear, and asked--did I want to hear what he was 
        saying? Hungry for any information, I replied in the affirmative and she 
        held the telephone receiver close to the TV. It was not what he said that 
        made me weep, but just that I suddenly became aware--in that moment--of 
        the distance that separated me from those I loved, of the enormity of 
        the atrocities that had been committed in New York and Washington, and 
        that what I was hearing formed just one small part of a historic unfolding 
        which could lead to more violence and unimaginable suffering throughout 
        the world. That feeling has not abated. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A response to 
        "erotics" [featured in reading/s How2/5] Against/Grain </b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All poetry is an 
        erotics insofar as it is about tension and texture. Intimacy implies a 
        thorough knowledge of a limited body while that body continually renews 
        itself. The tension of the known occurs while stumbling upon unexpected 
        comminglings: collage: one atop another. Eros invites us to enter the 
        dim mystery of a pattern. It is a pattern, however, that is animate. The 
        known defies the familiar, so fluid. These contradictions of lived experience 
        arouse. Tension doesn't so much release as give, against itself, permissions. 
        Contra-Dictions. The body sometimes needs to go against the grain in order 
        to perceive the grain. So there's a gorgeous, voluptuous obstinacy in 
        pronouncing the unsayable. What is more palpable--breath, saliva, &c--than 
        the blurring of boundaries. These many forms, 'figurative' and literal, 
        make up the pattern of some shifting whole. So a body of work resounds 
        and resides with a body of desire. As desire beckons with its ultimately 
        tantalizing textures. The very pleasure of the word, the words, are their 
        life as a body and how they rub me the wrong way.</font> </p>

        Kathleen Fraser, and three readers</b></font></font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>KF's 
        question/ 1 . 18 . 01</b>: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You write: 
        "I am an MFA grad from ten years ago (a survivor of sorts) who has forsaken 
        the academic life for something less volatile. I am a woman poet who is 
        primarily influenced by male poets--particularly surrealist poets--and 
        it's hard to shake that." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These two 
        sentences are the basis of a book! But meanwhile, why don't you read the 
        "forum" in H2/n4, currently on-line through February, and see if you have 
        any response to any of it from your position of having chosen to give 
        up the academy. If anything burbles up, just write it into an email and 
        maybe we can get some discussion going among other readers. It seems that 
        many women remain quite timid around entering the public arena... and 
        must be lured in, i.e. given very particular invitations. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I wonder 
        what this is about....I'm puzzled why more women don't respond to the 
        "bait" of having a place to write responsively from any perspective or 
        style they choose. I've really wanted the unspoken questions of "taste-making," 
        selection of what gets into print, and the on-going questions of power 
        relations to have a place to be sorted-out in this journal....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I'm curious 
        where you did your MFA work? In the early '70s, I taught for two years 
        at the Iowa Writers Workshop--as well as a year at Reed College--before 
        landing at SF State University...and find myself very interested in how 
        you've described your academic experience as "volatile"--sufficiently 
        so, to lead you to give it up... . </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I will definitely 
        look deeper into the layers of the H2 site and maybe get up the courage 
        to contribute. I was struck by what you said in your last email about 
        women needing to be lured in--I think I follow that behavior. I am timid 
        and every piece of writing needs to be almost beaten out of me. I resist 
        the work of writing, but once I am in it, I love it. I don't know if it's 
        a self-esteem thing or what--probably. Being outside academia, I sometimes 
        don't feel qualified to make any statements or judgements. I have definitely 
        left that high-critical language behind. Would I sound dumb? Not in the 
        know? These are the personal demons I struggle with and sometimes overcome 
        by writing ... Every new review is a new accomplishment, something new 
        to learn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I received 
        my MFA from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.... It was harrowing 
        at times, but the best thing about it was meeting close friends whose 
        relationships really helped to shape my writing life more than the classes 
        or teachers. Some of these same friends are here in Minneapolis, so we 
        continue the discussion and mutual celebration of poetry and writing.

        of information. The great thing about web sites are their non-linear structure, 
        a sort of Big Bang theory of expansion as one link takes you to another, 
        one interest sparks another. H2 definitely shows the care and time you've 
        spent on it--I really like the old B&W pictures of modernist women writers 
        as well as the minimalist and clean white look of it. . </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Dear Kelly, 
        You'd be surprised at how your feelings and situation speak for so many!!! 
        The push/pull around going public that you describe is an all-pervasive 
        problem many are up against. Recently, several H2 readers' private emails 
        spoke of the anxiety of writing beyond a small circle of friends and also 
        of the various traumas of grad school--who/what is voiced vs. what remains 
        unvoiced...both in grad school and after, feeling a bit anxious to have 
        one's actual experience or thinking revealed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By the way, 
        if you are into film, you might enjoy writing about some female-directed 
        (or authored) surrealist or modernist film/s??? Did you see the interviews 
        we did of filmmakers Pelle Lowe (H2/3) and Yvonne Rainer (H2/4)? I see 
        film and its construction as very interrelated to the project of constucting 
        the modernist and contemporary inventions of/interventions into that thing 
        called "poem". Why don't you work on a visual/word piece for the mixed 
        media section for issue 6 (since n5 is just about to go on-line, end of 
        Feb., under the new Editorship of Ann Vickery. (I'll still be doing the 
        "postcard" selection.) Think about it...you could use photos, art work, 
        written responses both longer and shorter...It could be fun! </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>KF's 
        question/ 1 . 10 . 01</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> ...if I 
        hadn't thought to invite you (as now clarified) to write a response to 
        an "under-appreciated" book (or books) you are currently fascinated by, 
        would you have thought to ever send in something to How2 on your own?? 
        Would it have felt risky in any way? Would you have felt prohibited? Unconsciously 
        waiting for a personal and specific invitation? I ask because I've been 
        struck by the fact that in over 2 years of editing H2, the only persons 
        initiating "reviews" have been male, even though I thought H2 was proferring 
        an open invitation... Clearly we've not yet adequately understood a missing 
        piece of the puzzle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Are we looking 
        at habit, here, or something more?? I assumed that if the place was created 
        and the descriptions of/invitations to different sections clear enough, 
        the space would be used very actively. Not true. It is in precisely this 
        area that work still needs to be done to further open up the range of 
        styles and voices --poets who might be interested in and willing to write 
        about their own takes on what they are reading, instead of leaving it 
        entirely up to the academic scholar/critics--many of whom are brilliant 
        and inventive, others who read, rather exclusively, from the perspective 
        of a very specific training & set of categories tending to leave out work 
        that doesn't "fit".... Daunting. . </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>MB's 
        response/ 1. 12 . 01:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> As for 
        whether I would have sent work without prompting...I am no doubt too reticent 
        for my own good in unleashing my work on the world, a result of my abiding 
        ambivalence, whether learned or innate. I haven't yet managed to balance 
        my particular needs for privacy, focus, and modesty, with the authoritativeness 
        or exoticism that seem to be required for a public literary identity. 
        But then again some of that comes from the indifference with which the 
        work is often greeted. My ambitions are conflicted and not infrequently 
        discouraged. I've </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">invested 
        too much in feminist/leftist critique to say that my reticence is just 
        a function of my personality. On the other hand I've been slow to engage 
        that critique in a way that would bring my work into a more public discourse. 
        Yes, I've been afraid to be a more public writer; have maybe kept my work 
        more subjective, private.... Which has left me with the dissatisfying 
        feeling of being outside of any public dialogue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> But my 
        version of what a public, political discourse might be may not be recognizable 
        to some. I'm suspicious of much conspicuously "political" writing and 
        its potential for dogmatism and reductiveness. I find politics in the 
        subtle, solitary acts of perception and the formation of cognitive structures 
        for apprehension and response. But the subtlety, the minutia, of such 
        activities may result in work that seems inert rather than arresting. 
        Or so I conclude, as I seem often to find myself mouthing inaudibly amidst 
        a thunderous din. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Undeniably 
        a "specific and personal invitation" is a motivation to enter the fray. 
        It's exactly that kind of interest that brings a sense of the work being 
        relevant to an audience, of its being a part of the larger writing/reading/ 
        thinking world. I'm not one of those who's been able to convince myself 
        of a work's relevance without some sign from the outside. To a certain 
        degree, I think my writing project is about this very thing: the (often 
        vexed) relationship between the very private subject and the seemingly 
        remote power vectors that shape the social world. While the duality of 
        private/ public is discredited these days, I need to retain some distinction 
        like that to understand what's at stake in taking part in a public dialogue.

        thinking about what I might do for How2, and would like to suggest a book 
        I've been fascinated with for a while...longing for a chance to engage 
        with one particular piece. That piece seems to fit in with my on-going 
        obsessions about landscape, space, and grids, dynamics, and connections 
        . . . I'm very flattered to be asked to contribute to H2! I much enjoyed 
        delving into the archives of HOW(ever) when I was researching Barbara 
        Guest's work. It's so good to have all that material available on the 
        web--I'd been wanting to see copies of the original journal for a long 
        time--and have been following How2 ever since. .</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I don't 
        know how to write about all this. Struggling with the gender issues has 
        been very very painful for me here, and now that things seem to be improving 
        somewhat, I'm a bit loathe to reopen old wounds!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> There are 
        some real practical issues for me that account for my not sending materials 
        to How2 and not speaking up in on-line formats that I'd like to touch 
        on. But most importantly, I have to find a way of writing about the politics 
        of women's connections with each other that is truthful (but not over-revealing) 
        of the particulars of my situation, yet at the same time avoids giving 
        the impression that I think it's just "my problem" ...for the subject 
        is extremely important.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Thank you 
        for giving me the chance to see the other email contributions to this 
        "postcard" correspondence. The questions raised make me think about all 
        kinds of _practical_ reasons why someone like me doesn't make good use 
        of forums that seem ready-made for speaking-out, even those as welcoming 
        as How2. More on this later in this discussion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I also need 
        to find a way to write "in public" about the kinds of issues you and I 
        have discussed in earlier emails. (Even revealing a previous one-on-one 
        discussion feels problematic!) I can see _your_ frustration, coming across 
        verbalized anxieties (issues) that often tangle us up in women's writing 
        and scholarship --but not being able to persuade us to write about them 
        in a form we'll allow to be made public. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The feeling 
        that it's "just me" is part of ithe problem, of course. It's not so much 
        that I always think my point-of-view isn't worth listening to, or that 
        it doesn't deserve to be heard. (To my surprise, I often feel quite confident 
        about my views, though of course that creates its own pressures.) The 
        basic issue is that I am the only woman in my program to voice dissatisfaction--consistently 
        and somewhat openly--about its gender politics. The program I am currently 
        a part of is one that has constructed its identity on the basis of oppositionality, 
        and requires that its students be loyal dissenters in supposedly hostile 
        territory: "If you're not for us; you're against us." So the intellectual 
        climate is very much"the fray" that Mary mentions, rather than any kind 
        of open arena or protected zone! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A seemingly 
        "open space" is created that is full of invisible barriers. The odd thing 
        is that when someone bumps up against one of these, s/he becomes amazingly 
        and embarrassingly visible, fully clothed in whatever kind of identitarian 
        outfit suits the occasion. "Ah, we have a woman among us... (substitute 
        whatever other label you like). How nice that you can speak up!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In other 
        classes that I attend, issues of race, class, gender, sexuality come and 
        go as seems required by the subject under discussion and it isn't always 
        left to the "other-identified" (as opposed to "self-identified") minority 
        to speak up for themselves about whatever "their" issues are judged to 
        be. While theory can certainly be misused as a debating tool--i.e., "I 
        have a bigger, more famous, currently cooler theorist to apply to this 
        issue than you do!"--it can also provide a framework that, because it 
        is somewhat depersonalized, can allow push/pull and debate that goes beyond 
        identitarian boxing-in. This is what I see happening in the best of the 
        classes that I attend outside my own program. The risk, of course, with 
        that kind of approach is that "speaking from experience" can get censored-out. 
        In classrooms where I do feel comfortable enough to speak up, I try to 
        take a pride in speaking from experience as well as theory. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sitting 
        in a room full of smart, interesting people who consistently ignore certain 
        kinds of extremely important issues or assigned readings, and knowing 
        that unless "my" kind of person raises them they won't be raised--whereas, 
        if I do speak up, I'll be assumed to be speaking just because I am that 
        kind of person--is not only appallingly silencing, but also excruciatingly 
        frustrating. I leave the room and feel utterly drained with the effort 
        of (not) speaking. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It also 
        feels very lonely. The obvious answer to the situation I'm describing 
        is for a group of the "whatever" kind to get together and speak up and 
        support each other. But here I find myself in another kind of quandary 
        that is particularly hard to talk about in this context. One of the very 
        sad things about all this, especially for me, given the wonderfully supportive 
        female community I had while getting my MFA, was to see how the women 
        here get split apart and almost set against each other. For various personal 
        (?) reasons, few have seemed prepared to rock the boat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A difficulty 
        for me in this situation is handling inter-generational feminist divides. 
        From my experience here, the woman student who is "non-traditional" (in 
        this context, older returning students) doesn't have much authority in 
        the lit crit or poetry classroom, She is, I suspect, seen as boring, mumsy, 
        and worst of all, "essentialist".</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Most perplexing 
        of all, if she also declares herself to be a feminist (how old-fashioned!), 
        she obviously hasn't read (as indeed I haven't--I was hoping for a class 
        here that would provide it!) the historical sequence of first-wave, second-wave, 
        etc., feminisms. It is very clear to me that in my program, women (among 
        other groups) are are not in a situation that encourages them to speak 
        up about issues that aren't on the currently "mainstream" agenda." To 
        say anything in the classroom--or to individuals, privately--that would 
        even hint at this observation would be seen as patronizing. How dare I 
        speak for someone else and make them look weak and naive? (As I write 
        this, I notice--and resent--the twist I find myself putting on all this: 
        not "this situation is bad," but "here's why this situation is so hard 
        for me".) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I know that 
        none of this will be news to many women. It's just been a big lesson to 
        me--my hardest seminar last year was probably "gender politics". Having 
        spent so much of my work life, and then in my MFA program among highly 
        articulate and competent women scholars and professors, I came to realize 
        that up to that time, I'd been very sheltered in professional situations. 
        Even at work when, as happened not infrequently, I found myself "the only 
        woman" (certainly often the only college-educated one, and hence an anomaly!), 
        in business meetings, I never felt I was speaking "as a woman" (hence 
        boxed-in)...as has happened to me here. I was an oddity, but there was 
        respect for oddities, especially if they had some technical expertise. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of course 
        I have had some support, especially in private. But the worst hostility 
        I encountered here came after a few of us dared--openly-- to put together 
        a publicly identifiable united front. I now restrict myself to minimal 
        appearances at poetry arenas (though that subject is what I came here 
        to do!), and feel much more confident now that I'm not constantly exposing 
        (or not exposing!) myself. There have been some changes in the last year, 
        though, and more women have been entering this program, which has to be 
        a good thing! I can see some differences happening, as a result of that--I 
        notice that women's issues are discussed more...but still, from what I 
        hear, this happens mainly at the instigation of the women in the room. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About my 
        difficulty in expressing any of this in public (as opposed to privately): 
        that awkward business of seeming to speak for other people. How dare I 
        do that? I worry that perhaps I have got it all wrong, after all? What 
        right _have_ I got to voice an opinion, especially a public one? I badly 
        need to know that I've got it "right" . . . as if such a thing were entirely 
        possible!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I actually 
        feel deeply anguished at being told that I've "misunderstood" or that 
        I just "don't get it". . . I can find a certain confidence (mentioned 
        earlier), but I know it's a bit of an act. Because it's an act, it feels 
        easily under-minable, and at the same time, I worry about its staginess 
        and its (necessarily?) forceful rhetoric, and the effect that this has 
        on the truthfulness of what I am saying?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I find 
        that a good deal of my best thinking is done through poetry, and I believe 
        that this is because there I am able to be truthful about the difficulties 
        inherent in writing--anything at all. That feels much more honest!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Before 
        signing-off, I wanted to say something very quickly about some of the 
        practical things that stop me from taking part in this kind of public 
        debate. First there must be time and effort! This is the third or fourth 
        occasion in the last 8 months or so that I've done this kind of writing. 
        In each case, I felt I just had to get something out, forcefully, and 
        fast. Email is very pressurized--listserves particularly so, and particularly 
        competitive, too. Get something out now! Jump in before the next person! 
        A practical side of me says, yes, this is the only way to do this, while 
        you're burning hot with the issue, while there's interest in it, an occasion 
        for it. But this fights with the side of me that says, this is not how 
        effective work is done. You have to be able to edit, to have time to write 
        and come back fresh to revise. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The occasion 
        was there, the issues demanded it, and I felt fired-up and desperate to 
        make myself heard. But this is actually the hardest and most challenging 
        kind of writing I ever do. Far harder than writing academic papers! It 
        feels like running a race, or taking a very tightly timed exam. How best 
        to do justice to the occasion (and the people involved), and my anger, 
        and to be truthful to my insights and intuition, and at the same time 
        be as persuasive and clear as I can? Even done all in one day (as this 
        current piece is), it takes up huge amounts of time and emotional energy. 
        Today, I've put aside some long-overdue grading, just to give this thing 
        the time it needs, including going through its various layers: first emoting, 
        then trying to get to some more rational-sounding structure, some attempt 
        at balance (no one wants to sound shrill, or whiny), then editing for 
        diplomacy's sake (after all, this thing is public!).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Re being 
        invited--that certainly makes a big difference! But even then, and even 
        given less emotionally fraught material, it's genuinely difficult to make 
        the time. Even you had to ask me twice for a book review last year, and 
        I was so thrilled to be asked!! As I'm sitting here typing I'm trying 
        not to look at a second reminder to send some poems to a magazine. I guess, 
        having the space to speak may not be enough. (After all, the frustrating 
        classrooms I've described certainly looked open enough to begin with!) 
        I need invitations, structure, something to bounce off, and the emotional 
        resources that will help me key myself up to speaking-up and ignoring 
        my other commitments! I don't think well on my feet; would much rather 
        take things away and look at them quietly, digest them a bit, and then 
        come back and say my piece. But frustratingly, my current lifestyle won't 
        let me do that. Really a very basic aspect to being shut up! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'm actually 
        very very angry that graduate school (in its PhD form) shuts me away from 
        all kinds of what I characterize as connecting, feminine parts of me --keeping 
        up with and being supportive to friends and family, taking part in exchanges 
        like this. I absolutely don't think the either/or sacrifice is a necessary 
        part of the choice, and I think it's especially hard on women!! Sorry 
        to go on and on about this--it's a very sore point right now. Add the 
        fear that I have in this place, isolated as I am, of cutting myself off 
        even more, and perhaps you have an answer to some of your questions?</font>

        film on Zora Hurston for the Public Broadcasting System with major grants 
        from PBS, the NEA and the NEH. This project has been a "work in progress" 
        for ten years, which probably says more about me than it does about the 
        project. But it's now in full-swing and I think it will be an exciting 
        piece just because Hurston is such a fascinating character -- and we've 
        filmed interviews with folks who have since passed on (Dorothy West for 
        instance) who have inner perspectives. The script was co-written by Julie 
        Dash and myself -- my co-producer is Sam Pollard, one of the "Eyes on 
        the Prize" producers as well as a film editor for Spike Lee. We anticipate 
        a PBS broadcast in late Spring 2002. The films focus will be Zora's anthropological 
        work as a platform for her fiction, for her life and politics. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In addition 
        to the film, Carla Kaplan is editing a collection of Zora's letters which 
        was to have been published this year but isn't out yet -- Valerie Boyd 
        is writing a biography which is to come out within the year -- and the 
        Hurstons are due to release a book of their own about their family. I 
        found some folktales at the Smithsonian that the Hurstons want to publish 
        but I don't know when that might happen. So there are many of the written 
        word types of publications going on with Hurston. </font></p>

        Doll Games" project</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I'd like 
        to invite readers of How2 to contribute to a collaborative web project, 
        the Doll Games. <a href="http://www.poetrykit.org/ezines.htm">http://www.ineradicablestain.com/dollgames</a>. 
        My sister and I began this project to document the perverse and elaborate 
        doll games we played as children, and that remains the core of the project. 
        The Doll Games has several layers: we tell true stories, and include bonafide 
        evidence that survives from those times (miniature books and letters "written 
        by" our dolls), but we also footnote and theorize in a faux-academic manner, 
        and address readers through a fictive and Kinbote-like editor. But this 
        "scholarship" is slippery in tone: it's funny, but sometimes we mean it. 
        The whole project sits uneasily between fiction and documentary, and that's 
        the way we like it. (I am a writer, best known as the author of the acclaimed 
        hypertext 'novel' Patchwork Girl; my sister is an independent scholar 
        with a PhD in rhetoric from UC Berkeley, so this hybrid work is a kind 
        of amalgam of our interests.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is 
        an ongoing project, and it's still in an early stage. Right now it revolves 
        around our own doll games, but over time, we hope the site will expand 
        to include a vast section of contributions from other women (though we 
        will we welcome men too) who have good stories to tell about their own 
        childhood doll games. (Our note to contributors is located at <a href="http://www.poetrykit.org/ezines.htm">http://www.ineradicablestain.com/dollgames/question.html</a>) 
        Because I suspect many of your readers are academics, however, I hope 
        some of them will feel moved, as we were, to subtly spoof their own disciplines--under 
        a pseudonym, if that seems liberating! </font></p>

        1930 work <i>Though Gently</i> mixes prose, verse, and aphorism into a 
        coherent analysis of the crisis of gender in the new humanism, American 
        democracy's ascendant geo-political power, and English poetry's infatuation 
        with the avant garde. Printed in a run of 200 copies, the text was slightly 
        flawed, and the book never reprinted. In 2001, the Laura Riding centenary, 
        <i>Delmar</i> magazine will reprint a correction of the original text, 
        along with responses to it by poets and critics, Riding scholars and<i> 
        Delmar</i>'s past-contributors. The work received absolutely no attention 
        in its initial commercial life.<i> Delmar</i> then invites the participation 
        in this project of interested Riding readers. Responses of under 2500 
        words must be submitted by December 31, 2000. For more information, or

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I just tried 
        to get current issue of HOW2 off of my computer at home using Microsoft 
        search engine--and using the www address on its own--and each time I ended 
        up with page showing #3 as current issue??? At the University using the 
        same procedures, I get page showing #4 as current issue. I have no idea 
        why this is happening? My computer at university is more powerful--but 
        I have a fairly good computer at home, too--and in both cases am using

        I've just tried searching for HOW2 through numerous search engines. One 
        of them (Yahoo!) turned up an archived issue (on the Rutgers webserver). 
        All the other searches turned up the correct one. When I searched through 
        Lycos, I found the current issue when searching Lycos, Infoseek, Northern 
        Light, Dogpile, Google, Ask Jeeves, Alta Vista, Direct Hit, HotBot, Go.com. 
        In all cases How2 appeared within the first page of results, and often 
        it was first or second. This looks pretty healthy to me, so I'm not sure 
        I need to do anything to "fix" it. Jeanne, if there's something I'm overlooking, 
        please let me know. --Roberta Sims</font></p>

        Could you try emptying the cache on your browser? Every time you load 
        a web page, your computer stores a temporary version of that page so that 
        if you call it up again, it will load faster. Your webserver at work might 
        be regularly emptied, but you have to empty it manually at home. If you 
        use Internet Explorer, click on "TOOLS," then "INTERNET OPTIONS." In the 
        middle it says: Temporary Internet Files. Click on "Delete Files," then 
        click the "okay" at the bottom If you use Netscape, chose "EDIT" then 
        "PREFERENCES." On the left side, at the bottom, it will say "ADVANCED." 
        Click on the Plus sign beside advanced. Click on the word "CACHE." Click 
        on the button that says "CLEAR MEMORY CACHE," then click "OK". Now click 
        on the button that says "CLEAR DISK CACHE" and click "OK." Click "OK" 
        one more time. Now try typing in the exact URL <font color="#FF0000">http://www.departments/bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2</font>
