Black smoke billowed from both buildings           and I thought I saw a free-falling body twist its way past the gaping           hole in Tower One. Yet the studio voices that accompanied the images           did not mention it. Had they not seen him or her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;           </span>TV anchors, some calm, some excited, repeated that a plane had           crashed into the North Tower, then hit the second one. It was live footage           of real buildings burning in real time, but they stood silent, with           no natural sound, at the surreal distance evoked by long camera shots.           As I watched, another explosion tore through the second tower and flames           silently consumed a lower portion of the building. The only frame or           reference for such images is the fictional narratives of computer-generated           action films in which cities are mutilated and destroyed. Independence           Day, one such cartoon-like adventure, demolished New York and Washington,           the very cities I now watched burning.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our           perceptions have been permanently framed by the sensibilities of those           commanding fictions, and TV practitioners are certainly under the sway           of the techno-hyper-real. It seemed as if we were living through Life           the Movie. These events had already happened and this was some sort           of spectacular sequel. Openly awed by the visual spectacle, &#8220;it           was quite a sight,&#8221; one intoned. Some awareness, just below the           level of waking, continued to nag at my reception of the pictures, aren&#8217;t           there people in the buildings? The TV voices were not helping even as           they recounted, over and over, the actual events. A pilot on a remote           phone connection with Channel 4 had seen, &#8220;the plane screaming           by at full power.&#8221; By the time he looked out his apartment window,           about 4 or 5 seconds later, it had hit Tower One. As he spoke the buildings           burned benignly against the sky of the clear September day. Though there           was emotion in his voice, it was hard to bring actual human beings into           this zone that was essentially fictional, uniquely visual, and usually           without real consequences. After all, we didn&#8217;t mourn for the           thousands who died in Independence Day. But didn&#8217;t I just see           someone, an actual person&#8217;s body falling to the ground?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The           people we did hear from were the ones already out of harm's way Eyewitnesses           told how they had fled the building. A misguided sense of responsibility           might have prevented reporters from attending to those still inside.           Was it some desire to prevent mass hysteria? Later that night, when           I finally got through to my friends in SoHo, I heard their sorrow at           seeing dozens of people crowded at the windows on the floors with no           exit routes. A man very near the top had waved a white cloth through           a broken window for at least 45 minutes. He never got out. After 7 hours           of watching television, I had not heard any such stories. Whatever the           reasons, television did not see fit to allow us to grieve for the people           left trapped in the building at the time it went down. We will never           be able to have that collectively summoned moment of silence they all           deserved.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There           was much concern for the NewYork skyline. At Newark airport one journalist           pointed a camera over the tails of a fleet of United jets to find empty           sky, where this morning he told us, we would have seen the World Trade           Center. Throughout the day TV openly lamented the loss of the buildings,           yet the fact that people lay buried under the rubble was almost never           mentioned. One police officer requesting anonymity estimated losses           in the thousands. Whether the media decided for themselves, or simply           followed official admonitions, the effect was the same. One journalist           actually used the term &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; for those killed,           diminishing the humanity of those lost.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A           New Yorker covered in soot ran down the street. He came in and out of           the frame, and as he did I could see his lips move but the sound was           off. The studio voices were always laid over the images, they interpreted,           explained, but never let me hear the people on the street. Some considered           media worthy were brought into the studio or moved out of the direct           action and interviewed, but only short snippets of what they said were           aired. We were told that a storeowner was giving out water, but I did           not see such meaningful moments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to be with my fellow New Yorkers, sharing their struggles           for survival, and grieving for the ones lost. Instead, there was the           endless repetition of the most dramatic images. In addition to The Towers           Burning were images reminiscent of other movies including, Armageddon;           clouds of dust and rubble billowing from between the buildings, pursuing           people running away in the street. Repeating the picture over and over           with no sound removed it from real experience and turned it into a fascination.           By days end one of the newsmagazines had produced a slick sequence molded           into familiar entertainments, &#8220;doctors and interns lined up like           on a set of a disaster movie.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I           didn&#8217;t want to be a detached observer, awed by the spectacle,           entertained by cleaver references, calmed by the stories deemed appropriate           by gatekeepers. I wanted to be a thinking, feeling citizen, part of           a human community pulling together in a crisis. I wanted local reporters           in the streets getting the story on the ground. By the next day, local           news was doing just that, giving out help-line numbers, reporting on           family members searching for loved-ones, and in general being good citizens.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This           disaster has no frame of reference adequate for its expression and able           to grasp its meanings. The fictional frames are just that, entertainments.           We grasp for a way to express human dignity in the face of terrible           loss. We do have storylines and image conventions for death, ones applied           to people outside of our own communities. When the media air grizzly           pictures of famine, disasters, death and war elsewhere, they are usually           presented with little context, from a detached perspective: people crowded           together, under attack, starving, suffering horrible indignities. These           people are presented as the Other, through narratives of exclusion,           as little more than sights for our fascination. Ethical battles have           been fought, some won, some lost, about airing graphic depictions of           human horror. Many have been deemed too ratings worthy to be shelved.           We have no words, no media frames that can recognize the sadness of           death as it happens, while preserving the dignity of those it is happening           to. Media sensationalism often overcomes our feelings of empathy and           compassion. Are these the reasons we could not acknowledge that the           buildings were full of people?</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The           city is beginning to come to terms with the loss of life, as family           members search for those still missing and unaccounted for. No doubt           there are pictures and footage that we have not yet seen, of the horrible           events that occurred on Tuesday. More footage of the people who jumped           out of the buildings is starting to be aired. The audio track of screams           and chaos are beginning to accompany the repeated disaster footage.           Let us hope that these horrible sights don&#8217;t become the source           of revenue, or ratings boosters when commercials make their way back           on to our television screens. Hopefully we will now be more aware of           the need for empathy and compassion when we tell stories of death, loss           and destruction, not only for ourselves, but also for those who find           themselves in front of our cameras in other parts of the world.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>[Note:           Robin Andersen teaches media studies at Fordham University and is the           Director of the Peace and Justice Studies Program]</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><o:p></o:p></b></font></p>        <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>&lt;<a href="mailto:andersen@fordham.edu">andersen@fordham.edu</a>&gt;</b><spanstyle='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Palatino'><b><o:p></o:p></b></span></font><spanstyle='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Palatino'><b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>      </div>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>10/23/01</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">sent from         camille roy</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <b>Announcement         (RAWA)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A speaker         from the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan will be         speaking at Mills College on Nov. 1 and also at Theatre Artaud in San         Francisco on Nov. 4 (details to come for the Nov. 4 event).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is         a group which runs schools and clinics in refugee camps in Pakistan and         also documents the conditions for women in Afghanistan.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> &lt;<a href="mailto:minka@grin.net">minka@grin.net</a>&gt;</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>10/22/01</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sent in         by Megan Adams, from &lt;salon.com&gt;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The Taliban's         bravest opponents</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">An underground         resistance of Afghan women risks torture and execution<br>        to alert the world to the regime's atrocities. One freedom fighter tells<br>        Salon her story. (originally posted 10/2/01)<br>        - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>        By Janelle Brown<br>        The film footage is wobbly and blurry but stunning: A soccer stadium in         <br>        Afghanistan is packed with people, but there is no match today. Instead,<br>        a pickup truck drives into the stadium with three women, shrouded in<br>        burqas, cowering in the back. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Armed men         in turbans force a woman from the truck, and make her kneel at the penalty         line on the field. Confused and unable to see, the woman tries to look         behind just as a rifle is pointed against the back of her<br>        head. With no fanfare whatsoever, she is shot dead. The shaky video<br>        camera captures the cheering crowd as people rise to their feet, hoping<br>        to get a better view of the corpse on the ground. The blue folds of the<br>        burqa begin to stain red with blood. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This public         execution is some of the most shocking film ever seen on<br>        television; it is perhaps the best document that the West has of<br>        atrocities committed by the Taliban. It is just one part of an<br>        astonishing hour-long documentary called &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot;         currently<br>        in heavy rotation on CNN. Filmed by the half-Afghan British reporter<br>        Saira Shah, who traveled undercover to Afghanistan last year, &quot;Beneath<br>        the Veil&quot; neatly captures the horror of life under the Taliban--the<br>        public executions for infractions as minor as prostitution or adultery,         <br>        the brutality of fundamentalist police, the slaughter of civilians<br>        unlucky enough to live on the front line of the civil war with the<br>        Northern Alliance. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In documenting         life under the Taliban, Shah went into the homes of the<br>        Afghan people and onto the battlefields, cleverly evading the<br>        Department of Vice and Virtue, which would have thrown her in jail for<br>        filming illegally (all unsanctioned filming is forbidden). She visited         <br>        territory occupied by the Northern Alliance, and visited a village where<br>        the Taliban had brutally murdered dozens of civilians just weeks<br>        earlier-- a local wedding photographer had filmed the scene as<br>        villagers buried rotting bodies that had been scalped and mutilated. <br>        There, Shah also interviewed three teenage girls whose mother had been<br>        shot dead by the Taliban. They were so traumatized by the atrocities<br>        that the Taliban subsequently inflicted upon them that two of them<br>        would no longer speak. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But some         of the most heartstopping footage in &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot;<br>        including film of the execution of the women in the soccer stadium, was<br>        captured not by Shah but by an Afghan underground organization which<br>        assisted her in her work. Indeed, Shah's documentary would not have<br>        been possible were it not for the Revolutionary Association of the<br>        Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), an underground organization whose members         risk their lives every day in attempts to undermine the Taliban and publicize         its brutality. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">RAWA was         originally founded in 1977 as an Afghan feminist group<br>        focused on women's rights, but its mandate broadened when<br>        fundamentalists rose to power. Determined to expose the frightening<br>        abuses of the Taliban, women in the group began to hide video cameras<br>        under their burqa and document the executions and public floggings<br>        which take place every day under the Taliban. They also smuggle female<br>        journalists like Shaila Shah and Eve Ensler, writer/director of &quot;The<br>        Vagina Monologues,&quot; into the country, in hopes of bringing attention<br>        to their cause. In defiance of the Taliban's law forbidding education<br>        for women, RAWA also runs clandestine home-based schools for girls; for<br>        women, who are forbidden to work, RAWA teaches handicrafts and sells<br>        them online. In the refugee camps in Pakistan, RAWA also provides<br>        medical assistance, housing and education for impoverished and <br>        terrified fugitives of Taliban rule. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">RAWA, the         most prominent Afghan-run organization to oppose the<br>        Taliban, has become one of the fundamentalists' greatest enemies.<br>        Perhaps the aspect of the group most infuriating to its opponents-- and<br>        a surprising key to its effectiveness -- is that it consists entirely<br>        of women, nearly 2,000 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, who use the cover<br>        of their burqas and the seeming powerlessness of their status to<br>        strategic advantage. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By traveling         with RAWA, Shah got a first-hand view of what it's like<br>        to be a woman living under the Taliban, and she was invited into RAWA's<br>        secret schools and illegal meetings. She also got access to its library<br>        of video footage -- which includes not just the film of the execution<br>        of the women, but footage of the public hanging of three men in the same<br>        soccer stadium. (The soccer stadium was funded by international aid<br>        groups who wanted to raise the spirits of the Afghan people; instead,<br>        the Taliban is using it only for executions. One Taliban official told<br>        Shah that if the aid groups felt that the stadium should be used for <br>        soccer, they should build the Taliban an extra stadium for<br>        executions.) &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; was filmed long before the attacks         of<br>        Sept. 11, and, according to RAWA members, the situation in Afghanistan<br>        has since become more dire. Because the borders between Pakistan and<br>        Afghanistan have closed, the Afghan people are now trapped in their own<br>        country-- enduring the oppressive rule of the Taliban while waiting<br>        for U.S. bombs to drop from the sky. RAWA, meanwhile, says it is running<br>        out of money and can't afford to educate, feed and treat the millions<br>        of refugees massed along the border. The Pakistani police, which are<br>        sympathetic to the Taliban, regularly target RAWA members; and since<br>        communication with Afghanistan has been cut off, the RAWA members in <br>        Pakistan know little about what is happening to their members across the<br>        border. <br>        <br>        In a telephone interview from Islamabad, a 26-year-old member of RAWA,         identified only as &quot;Fatima,&quot; spoke about RAWA's work in Pakistan         and Afghanistan, its position on war and the Northern Alliance, and its<br>        &quot;uncompromising attitude&quot; toward fundamentalism. A seven-year         veteran<br>        of the group's dangerous brand of activism, Fatima is a member of the         <br>        RAWA political committee that has been trying to rally both Afghan women         and the international media to its agenda. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What         is your life story, and what do you do for RAWA? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. I'm from         Kabul. I started to work with RAWA when I was 19 years old.<br>        There has been war in our country for more than 23 years; my generation<br>        was born with war, we've experienced just crimes, just blackness, just<br>        sorrow in our country. We never saw happiness or democracy. I lived in<br>        shock, because every day there were tragic stories in my neighborhood<br>        around me. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I was         young I decided to do something about this. A lot of young<br>        girls commit suicide because they are helpless and hopeless. But some,<br>        like me, choose the way of struggle. We accept that we want to serve<br>        our people -- that this is the best way to bring justice to our country.         <br>        When I was 20 years old, I left Afghanistan; my job for RAWA was to<br>        come here to Pakistan and work in the refugee camps. I had to cross the<br>        border often and go back into Afghanistan to organize women for<br>        demonstrations; and to bring RAWA's publications into Afghanistan. We<br>        would go secretly and without documents -- no one asks you for them <br>        because you are a woman. I wear the burqa then, because this is the<br>        only visa required for women to enter Afghanistan. When I<br>        cross the border, no one can know that I am in RAWA. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Why do         you use the pseudonym &quot;Fatima&quot;? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A.We all         use different names all the time, because we have a lot of<br>        security problems. Our leader Meena and her bodyguards were<br>        assassinated in Pakistan in 987 by the Islamic fundamentalists and the<br>        KGB. Our members are always attacked and injured -- we receive death<br>        threats by e-mail and letters and telephone, telling us to stop what we<br>        are doing or they will kill us. So we are working clandestinely in <br>        Afghanistan, and in Pakistan we are half-secret. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. Have         you ever been personally attacked by the Taliban?<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. I was         flogged three times in the streets, for stupid reasons. They<br>        will flog women that don't have the veil on, or aren't with their male<br>        relative, or are talking to a male shopkeeper, or are out on the<br>        streets during the evening. There are always people sobbing in the<br>        streets because they are being beaten. This is normal. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In Pakistan         in1999, I was injured at a RAWA demonstration. Pakistan<br>        is one of the countries that officially recognizes the Taliban<br>        government; so when we take our anti-Taliban slogans into the streets,<br>        they try to stop us. During the demonstration, we were fighting -- we<br>        wanted to go in front of the United Nations building; but the Pakistani<br>        police wanted to stop us. During the fighting, they beat me and broke<br>        my hand. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What         has been RAWA's most crucial activity in Afghanistan? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We teach         hundreds of women and children in the underground schools in Afghanistan.         For children, we teach mathematics, physics, chemistry,<br>        Persian, science, social studies and the history of Afghanistan; also,<br>        the geography of the world. For women, we just teach them two main<br>        subjects -- mathematics and Persian. When our women go to the shops,<br>        they don't know how to pay the shopkeeper and get change, because they<br>        haven't had an education. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We also         bring in video cameras to expose the crimes of the Taliban.<br>        It's risky work. We filmed the execution of the women that you saw in<br>        &quot;Beneath the Veil.&quot; Also, we've filmed hangings in Kabul and         several<br>        other cities, taken pictures of Afghans who have had their hands cut<br>        off for stealing, or their necks cut. There are photos on our Web site.         <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We make         a hole in the burqa and film through it. That's why the<br>        quality of our films is very bad; it's very difficult. No one has ever<br>        been caught doing it; but execution is the only punishment if you get<br>        caught, especially if the Taliban knew we were RAWA.<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What         are you doing in the refugee camps in Pakistan? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We have         schools for girls in the fugitive camps; but in some we have<br>        problems because of the influence of the fundamentalists. We have<br>        handicraft projects for women; we run chicken farms, a jam-making<br>        business and carpet weaving projects. We also have mobile medical teams<br>        that go in to the camps one or two days a week to give free medicine.         We<br>        had a hospital called Malalai, but it closed because of our financial<br>        problems; one of our very urgent projects is to reopen it. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. What         are your feelings about the attack on America? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. We are         so sorry for the victims of this terrorist attack. We want to<br>        shower them with deep solidarity. We can understand their sorrow because         we also suffered this terrorism for more than 23 years. We were already         victims of this tragedy. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On the other         hand, unfortunately, we warned the United States<br>        government about this many, many times; as well as the other countries<br>        that are supporting and creating the fundamentalist parties. They helped<br>        create these terrorists during the Cold War; they supported Osama bin<br>        Laden [during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan]. Fundamentalism is<br>        equal to terrorism; it's equal to crime. We said, this germ won't just<br>        be in Afghanistan, it will spread out all over the world. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Today we         can see this with our own eyes. We warned them but they never listened         to our cry, to our voice. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Q. How is         the crisis in America affecting your work at RAWA? <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A. Thousands         of families are escaping from Afghanistan, leaving everything behind because         they are afraid of war. Thousands of others that are living in Afghanistan         don't have the possibility to immigrate here; and now, even the borders         are closed. That means that our people have to burn in the flame of war         and all the doors are closed. <br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In fugitive         camps it's really hard to work, especially hard because<br>        millions of fugitives have just arrived. They are in shock, and have<br>        nothing but themselves and the clothes on their back. I met a family<br>        yesterday that wanted help from RAWA, they cried and said they walked<br>        through the mountains because the border was closed.

Like most of us since         these attacks, I have been more aware of being alive as a gift. I have         reached out to loved ones to tell them I love them. And like most of us,         I am scared and wish I didn&#146;t feel so helpless. Because as I write,         the U.S. has started bombing Afghanistan. The bombing does not make me         feel safe. It makes me feel unsafe. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the radio         commentators remarked on the day the bombing started, apropos of the origins         of war, that the Vikings didn&#146;t have a word for the meaningless escalation         of violence that comprises the plot of the greatest Icelandic saga, Brennu         Njalsaga. Njal&#146;s Saga is the story of a wise man with an unwise family.         What starts out as a small retaliatory exchange between two households         escalates, despite Njal&#146;s best peacekeeping efforts, until two whole         clans are involved in the rivalry. At last Njal and all his household         are burned alive by their enemies. When the plot is reduced to its broad         outlines, the horror of the violence of killing so many people is writ         large (one of the themes of this saga). When we reduce the September 11th         attacks to the nineteen young Muslim fundamentalists--the sect is so sexist         we need not denote their sex--who highjacked four passenger airline jets         and killed over 6000 people in one hour, these terrorist acts seem to         us clearly mad. Crazy mad. The actions of lunatics. From our perspective.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Angry mad, from their         perspective. Why do they hate us? Americans asked after the attack. &#147;How         do people reach this level of anger, hatred and frustration?&#148; asks         Professor of Conflict Studies John Paul Lederach. To call them lunatics         misses a crucial point: By my experience, explanations that they are brainwashed         by a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is         an escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed         responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational, identity-based         anger, is constructed over time through a combination of historical events,         a deep sense of threat to identity, and direct experience of sustained         exclusion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the terrorists&#146;         perspective, they are a David heroically fighting the bully-giant Goliath,         who is spreading Western imperialism. If we do as they expect, which is         to use our power against a weak people or nation, we can expect without         a doubt that they will engage in the future in ever-escalating cycles         of revenge and violence.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Vikings in fact         did have a word for the senseless feuding that drives the plot of Njal&#146;s         Saga, which is the word used to rationalize the violence by the characters.         It is the same word as motivated the terrorists on September 11th, the         same word as is motivating U.S. and British retaliation. It is a word         for an heroic concept, a warrior&#146;s code. That word is honor, along         with the component parts of the ancient heroic code: pride and shame,         loyalty and betrayal. One of the men interviewed on the radio the day         we started the bombing was a veteran of the Gulf War. When asked if he&#146;d         go back to war if drafted, he said, &#147;Of course. It&#146;s the warrior&#146;s         code, to rip the living heart out of the enemy&#146;s chest. I&#146;m         a warrior.&#148; </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Honor requires us         to retaliate, or the enemy will think he can get away with murder. But         honor, too, will require the other side to avenge such retaliation because         we &#147;deserved&#148; the punishing &#147;justice&#148;they dealt us.         At the dawning of the twenty-first century, we discover that we understand         the saga&#145;s world of the blood feud and violent retaliation because,         to our shock and horror, we are suddenly living it. However much we refuse         to hear them, from the Muslim extremist perspective, the U.S. has been         made &#147;to pay&#148; for past grievances to the Muslim world, for which         we had never shown remorse. Now, we are making Afghanistan &#147;pay&#148;         for harboring terrorists. But Afghanistan did not attack the U.S. So,         the U.S. will eventually be made to &#147;pay&#148; for its harming Afghanistan.         How far and how long will this exchange of violence go?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We desperately need         another model for what is deemed an honorable response. That model also         lies in Njal&#146;s Saga as well, in Njal himself. The saga was written         after Iceland had converted in 1000 A.D. to Christianity. Thus, although         its action takes place before the conversion, its theme is influenced         by gentler Christian tenets. Njal is a pagan precursor of what I will         call &#147;radical Christianity&#148; (to distinguish it from the bigotry         of most versions of fundamentalist Christianity, much like the terrorists&#146;         Islamic fundamentalism must be distinguished from the gentler Muslim faith).         Njal counsels tolerance and negotiates nonviolent alternative responses         to violence. He wheels and deals for peace. Although the violence of his         pagan family eventually takes him down with them, he represents an alternative         that redefines the heroic code of honor. We need that alternative now.         What are the possibilities?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a start, we could         redefine &#147;honor&#148; as being able to hear both sides, both perspectives,         not just our own. We could view violence itself as dishonorable, and every         &#147;holy war&#148;--both sides have bandied this phrase about--as sacrilege.         Certainly when we are the target, we call violence &#147;barbaric&#148;and         &#147;heinous.&#148; Why is it justified when we perpetrate it ourselves?         We could consider our own possible responses in terms other than violence.         And to those who say we will look weak to the world if we negotiate, we         could answer: We need another definition of strength. Strength is the         courage to wait and to make a considered response. Strength is not throwing         our military weight around. Strength is seeking insistently--and, why         not? aggressively--negotiated, diplomatic solutions.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We need to honor         the memories of our own victims by listening to their families. Many of         the families of the September 11th dead are not calling for retaliation,         but for peacemaking. Touched so deeply and irrevocably by this tragedy,         these families understood more immediately than any of us that no violence         will return their loved ones to life, no retaliatory strike could suffice         to comfort them in their grief. They say again and again that their dead         would not wish other innocent people to die for their deaths. In escalating         the violence, we risk making the deaths of over 6000 civilians truly meaningless,         for we will have failed to understand the lesson in their deaths: that         how we feel now is how civilians in Baghdad felt when we bombed them,         how civilians in Serbia felt, how civilians in Japan felt. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is it not dishonorable         that we were indifferent to the pain we caused? We need to redefine honor         as caring about the consequences of our actions in the world, and as not         hypocritically mouthing the rhetoric of democracy when we take geopolitical         action. Not only should we care, because we can identify with grief felt         around the world. We must care--not as a rule of law, but as Barbara Kingsolver         puts it, as one of &#147;a hundred ways to be a good citizen, . . . to         look finally at the things we don&#146;t want to see.&#148;<br>        <br>        On September 11th our world changed. We Americans learned that we weren&#146;t         safe in our own country--whether we are warriors or peacemakers, whites         or people of color, men or women, gays or straights, legal or illegal         residents. All of us will suffer for the policies of the few in power.         But it doesn&#146;t have to be that way. This tragedy has produced a huge         awakening. We as a people have the opportunity now to change as well.         Instead of confirming the terrorists&#146; portrait of the U.S. as a bullying         superpower, we might still yet react unexpectedly, for example by beginning         to address real grievances in the region.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We might yet throw         ourselves into supporting sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine,         and stop now the bombing of Afghanistan, thereby being as good as our         word and proving to the Afghan people in our actions that we are not making         war against them. In this way, we might begin to defuse the reason that         young Arab men give their own lives to kill American civilians. Lederach         writes &#147;I believe that monumental times like these create conditions         for monumental change. . . . Let us choose democracy and reconciliation         over revenge and destruction.&#148; If we have not ruined already this         monumental chance for change by meeting violence with violence, that old         model of honorable blood vengeance, the terrible deaths we have suffered         will not have been in vain.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Ghandi said, &#147;We         must be the change we wish to see in the world.&#148; Mary Oliver&#146;s         question in her poem &#147;The Summer Day&#148;never seemed so urgently         timely: &#147;Tell me, what do you plan to do/ with your one wild and         precious life?&#148;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:peacewoman@earthlink.net">peacewoman@earthlink.net</a><br>        Taos, New Mexico</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>10/4/01</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[as sent in from         Elizabeth Treadwell Jackson, via Susan Landers, from original posting         on the EPC list]<br>        <b><br>        SISTERS ARISE &amp; VOCALIZE! <br>        by Anne Waldman</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Language has been         on the feminist political agenda for years.

More mainstream illumination         from the hidden dakinis and durgas! &amp; more Amy Goodmans! Some alternative/corrective         resource to power of VOICE.

The images flash even<br>        in my sleep. The heart of America ripped. Though natural, the cry for<br>        revenge and the call for the unleashing of the first war of this century,         prolonged or not, seems more connected to social and psychological processes         of finding a way to release deep emotional anguish, a sense of powerlessness,         and our collective loss than it does as a plan of action seeking to redress         the injustice, promote change and prevent it from ever happening again.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        I am stuck from airport to airport as I write this, the reality of a<br>        global system that has suspended even the most basic trust. My Duracell<br>        batteries and finger nail clippers were taken from me today and it gave<br>        me pause for thought. I had a lot of pauses in the last few days. Life<br>        has not been the same. I share these thoughts as an initial reaction<br>        recognizing that it is always easy to take pot-shots at our leaders from<br>        the sidelines, and to have the insights they are missing when we are not<br>        in the middle of very difficult decisions. On the other hand, having<br>        worked for nearly 20 years as a mediator and proponent of nonviolent<br>        change in situations around the globe where cycles of deep violence seem<br>        hell-bent on perpetuating themselves, and having interacted with people<br>        and movements who at the core of their identity find ways of justifying<br>        their part in the cycle, I feel responsible to try to bring ideas to the<br>        search for solutions. With this in mind I should like to pen several<br>        observations about what I have learned from my experiences and what they<br>        might suggest about the current situation. I believe this starts by<br>        naming several key challenges and then asking what is the nature of a<br>        creative response that takes these seriously in the pursuit of genuine,<br>        durable, and peaceful change.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        &nbsp;<br>        SOME LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF OUR CHALLENGE<br>        &nbsp;<br>        1. Always seek to understand the root of the anger - The first and<br>        most important question to pose ourselves is relatively simple though<br>        not easy to answer: How do people reach this level of anger, hatred and<br>        frustration? By my experience explanations that they are brainwashed by<br>        a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is an<br>        escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed<br>        responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational,<br>        identity-based anger, is constructed over time through a combination of<br>        historical events, a deep sense of threat to identify, and direct<br>        experiences of sustained exclusion. <br>        &nbsp;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is very important         to understand, because, as I will say again and again, our response to         the immediate events have everything to do with whether we reinforce and         provide the soil, seeds, and nutrients for future cycles of revenge and         violence. Or whether it changes. We should be careful to pursue one and<br>        only one thing as the strategic guidepost of our response:<br>        Avoid doing what they expect. What they expect from us is the lashing<br>        out of the giant against the weak, the many against the few. This will<br>        reinforce their capacity to perpetrate the myth they carefully seek to<br>        sustain: That they are under threat, fighting an irrational and mad<br>        system that has never taken them seriously and wishes to destroy them<br>        and their people. What we need to destroy is their myth not their people.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        2. Always seek to understand the nature of the organization - Over<br>        the years of working to promote durable peace in situations of deep,<br>        sustained violence I have discovered one consistent purpose about the<br>        nature of movements and organizations who use violence: Sustain thyself.<br>        This is done through a number of approaches, but generally it is through<br>        decentralization of power and structure, secrecy, autonomy of action<br>        through units, and refusal to pursue the conflict on the terms of the<br>        strength and capacities of the enemy.<br>        &nbsp;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One of the most         intriguing metaphors I have heard used in the<br>        last few days is that this enemy of the United States will be found in<br>        their holes, smoked out, and when they run and are visible, destroyed.<br>        This may well work for groundhogs, trench and maybe even guerilla<br>        warfare, but it is not a useful metaphor for this situation. And neither<br>        is the image that we will need to destroy the village to save it, by<br>        which the population that gives refuge to our enemies is guilty by<br>        association and therefore a legitimate target. In both instances the<br>        metaphor that guides our action misleads us because it is not connected<br>        to the reality. In more specific terms, this is not a struggle to be<br>        conceived of in geographic terms, in terms of physical spaces and<br>        places, that if located can be destroyed, thereby ridding us of the<br>        problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly our biggest and most visible weapon         systems are<br>        mostly useless.<br>        &nbsp;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We need a new metaphor,         and though I generally do not like<br>        medical metaphors to describe conflict, the image of a virus comes to<br>        mind because of its ability to enter unperceived, flow with a system,<br>        and harm it from within. This is the genius of people like Osama Ben<br>        Laden. He understood the power of a free and open system, and has used<br>        it to his benefit. The enemy is not located in a territory. It has<br>        entered our system. And you do not fight this kind of enemy by shooting<br>        at it. You respond by strengthening the capacity of the system to<br>        prevent the virus and strengthen its immunity. It is an ironic fact that<br>        our greatest threat is not in Afghanistan, but in our own backyard. We<br>        surely are not going to bomb Travelocity, Hertz Rental Car, or an<br>        Airline training school in Florida. We must change metaphors and move<br>        beyond the reaction that we can duke it out with the bad guy, or we run<br>        the very serious risk of creating the environment that sustains and<br>        reproduces the virus we &gt;wish to prevent.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        3. Always remember that realities are constructed -<br>        Conflict is, among other things, the process of building and sustaining<br>        very different perceptions and interpretations of reality. This means<br>        that we have at the same time multiple realities defined as such by<br>        those in conflict. In the aftermath of such horrific and unmerited<br>        violence that we have just experienced this may sound esoteric. But we<br>        must remember that this fundamental process is how we end up referring<br>        to people as fanatics, madmen, and irrational. In the process of<br>        name-calling we lose the critical capacity to understand that from<br>        within the ways they construct their views, it is not mad lunacy or<br>        fanaticism. All things fall together and make sense. When this is<br>        connected to a long string of actual experiences wherein their views of<br>        the facts are reinforced (for example, years of superpower struggle that<br>        used or excluded them, encroaching Western values of what is considered<br>        immoral by their religious interpretation, or the construction of an<br>        enemy-image who is overwhelmingly powerful and uses that power in<br>        bombing campaigns and always appears to win) then it is not a difficult<br>        process to construct a rational world view of heroic struggle against<br>        evil. Just as we do it, so do they. Listen to the words we use to<br>        justify our actions and responses.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And then listen to         words they use. The way to break such a<br>        process is not through a frame of reference of who will win or who is<br>        stronger. In fact the inverse is true. Whoever loses, whether tactical<br>        battles or the &quot;war&quot; itself, finds intrinsic in the loss the         seeds that<br>        give birth to the justification for renewed battle. The way to break<br>        such a cycle of justified violence is to step outside of it. This starts<br>        with understanding that TV sound bites about madmen and evil are not<br>        good sources of policy. The most significant impact that we could make<br>        on their ability to sustain their view of us as evil is to change their<br>        perception of who we are by choosing to strategically respond in<br>        unexpected ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take enormous courage and courageous<br>        leadership capable of envisioning a horizon of change.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        4. Always understand the capacity for recruitment-The<br>        greatest power that terror has is the ability to regenerate itself. What<br>        we most need to understand about the nature of this conflict and the<br>        change process toward a more peaceful world is how recruitment into<br>        these activities happens. In all my experiences in deep-rooted conflict<br>        what stands out most are the ways in which political leaders wishing to<br>        end the violence believed they could achieve it by overpowering and<br>        getting rid of the perpetrator of the violence. That may have been the<br>        lesson of multiple centuries that preceded us. But it is not the lesson<br>        from that past 30 years. The lesson is simple. When people feel a deep<br>        sense of threat, exclusion and generational experiences of direct<br>        violence, their greatest effort is placed on survival. Time and again         in<br>        these movements, there has been an extraordinary capacity for the<br>        regeneration of chosen myths and renewed struggle.<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One aspect of current         U.S. leadership that coherently matches<br>        with the lessons of the past 30 years of protracted conflict settings         is<br>        the statement that this will be a long struggle. What is missed is that<br>        the emphasis should be placed on removing the channels, justifications,<br>        and sources that attract and sustain recruitment into the activities.<br>        What I find extraordinary about the recent events is that none of the<br>        perpetrators was much older than 40 and many were half that age.<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is the reality         we face: Recruitment happens on a sustained<br>        basis. It will not stop with the use of military force, in fact, open<br>        warfare will create the soils in which it is fed and grows. Military<br>        action to destroy terror, particularly as it affects significant and<br>        already vulnerable civilian populations will be like hitting a fully<br>        mature dandelion with a golf club. We will participate in making sure<br>        the myth of why we are evil is sustained and we will assure yet another<br>        generation of recruits.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        5. Recognize complexity, but always understand the power of<br>        simplicity - Finally, we must understand the principle of simplicity.         I<br>        talk a lot with my students about the need to look carefully at<br>        complexity, which is equally true (and which in the earlier points I<br>        start to explore). However, the key in our current situation that we<br>        have failed to fully comprehend is simplicity. From the standpoint of<br>        the perpetrators, the effectiveness of their actions was in finding<br>        simple ways to use the system to undo it. I believe our greatest task         is<br>        to find equally creative and simple tools on the other side.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        Suggestions<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In keeping with the         last point, let me try to be simple. I<br>        believe three things are possible to do and will have a much greater<br>        impact on these challenges than seeking accountability through revenge.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        1.&nbsp; Energetically pursue a sustainable peace process to the<br>        Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Do it now. The United States has much it<br>        can do to support and make this process work. It can bring the weight         of<br>        persuasion, the weight of nudging people on all sides to move toward<br>        mutual recognition and stopping the recent and devastating pattern of<br>        violent escalation, and the weight of including and balancing the<br>        process to address historic fears and basic needs of those involved. If<br>        we would bring the same energy to building an international coalition<br>        for peace in this conflict that we have pursued in building<br>        international coalitions for war, particularly in the Middle East, if         we<br>        lent significant financial, moral, and balanced support to all sides<br>        that we gave to the Irish conflict in earlier years, I believe the<br>        moment is right and the stage is set to take a new and qualitative step<br>        forward.<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Sound like an odd         diversion to our current situation of terror?<br>        &nbsp;<br>        I believe the opposite is true. This type of action is precisely<br>        the kind of thing needed to create whole new views of who we are and<br>        what we stand for as a nation. Rather than fighting terror with force,<br>        we enter their system and take away one of their most coveted elements:<br>        The soils of generational conflict perceived as injustice used to<br>        perpetrate hatred and recruitment. I believe that monumental times like<br>        these create conditions for monumental change. This approach would<br>        solidify our relationships with a broad array of Middle Easterners and<br>        Central Asians, allies and enemies alike, and would be a blow to the<br>        rank and file of terror. The biggest blow we can serve terror is to make<br>        it irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing we could do is to feed it<br>        unintentionally by making it and its leaders the center stage of what         we<br>        do. Let's choose democracy and reconciliation over revenge and<br>        destruction. Let's do exactly what they do not expect, and show them it<br>        can work.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        &nbsp;2. Invest financially in development, education, and a broad<br>        social agenda in the countries surrounding Afghanistan rather than<br>        attempting to destroy the Taliban in a search for Ben Laden. The single<br>        greatest pressure that could ever be put on Ben Laden is to remove the<br>        source of his justifications and alliances. Countries like Pakistan,<br>        Tajikistan, and yes, Iran and Syria should be put on the radar of the<br>        West and the United States with a question of strategic importance: How<br>        can we help you meet the fundamental needs of your people? The strategic<br>        approach to changing the nature of how terror of the kind we have<br>        witnessed this week reproduces itself lies in the quality of<br>        relationships we develop with whole regions, peoples, and worldviews.         If<br>        we strengthen the web of those relationships, we weaken and eventually<br>        eliminate the soil where terror is born. A vigorous investment, taking<br>        advantage of the current opening given the horror of this week shared         by<br>        even those who we traditionally claimed as state enemies, is immediately<br>        available, possible and pregnant with historic possibilities. Let's do<br>        the unexpected. Let's create a new set of strategic alliances never<br>        before thought possible.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        &nbsp;3. Pursue a quiet diplomatic but dynamic and vital support of<br>        he Arab League to begin an internal exploration of how to address the<br>        root causes of discontent in numerous regions. This should be coupled<br>        with energetic ecumenical engagement, not just of key symbolic leaders,<br>        but of a practical and direct exploration of how to create a web of<br>        ethics for a new millennium that builds from the heart and soul of all<br>        traditions but that creates a capacity for each to engage the roots of<br>        violence that are found within their own traditions. Our challenge, as         I<br>        see it, is not that of convincing others that our way of life, our<br>        religion, or our structure of governance is better or closer to Truth<br>        and human dignity. It is to be honest about the sources of violence in<br>        our own house and invite others to do the same. Our global challenge is<br>        how to generate and sustain genuine engagement that encourages people<br>        from within their traditions to seek that, which assures the<br>        preciousness and respect for life that every religion sees as an<br>        inherent right and gift from the Divine, and how to build organized<br>        political and social life that is responsive to fundamental human needs.<br>        Such a web cannot be created except through genuine and sustained<br>        dialogue and the building of authentic relationships, at religious and<br>        political spheres of interaction, and at all levels of society. Why not<br>        do the unexpected and show that life-giving ethics are rooted in the<br>        core of all peoples by engaging a strategy of genuine dialogue and<br>        relationship? Such a web of ethics, political and religious, will have<br>        an impact on the roots of terror far greater in the generation of our<br>        children's children than any amount of military action can possibly<br>        muster. The current situation poses an unprecedented opportunity for<br>        this to happen, more so than we have seen at any time before in our<br>        global community.<br>        &nbsp;<br>        A Call for the Unexpected<br>        &nbsp;<br>        Let me conclude with simple ideas. To face the reality of well<br>        organized, decentralized, self-perpetuating sources of terror, we need<br>        to think differently about the challenges. If indeed this is a new war<br>        it will not be won with a traditional military plan. The key does not<br>        lie in finding and destroying territories, camps, and certainly not the<br>        civilian populations that supposedly house them. Paradoxically that will<br>        only feed the phenomenon and assure that it lives into a new generation.<br>        The key is to think about how a small virus in a system affects the<br>        whole and how to improve the immunity of the system. We should take<br>        extreme care not to provide the movements we deplore with gratuitous<br>        fuel for self-regeneration. Let us not fulfill their prophecy by<br>        providing them with martyrs and justifications. The power of their<br>        action is the simplicity with which they pursue the fight with global<br>        power. They have understood the power of the powerless.

Now those responses are floating and opaque;         sometime later they'll harden into definitions (the making of History).         I think that's a good reason for us to be watchful and keep on writing.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And 'as life goes         on' I can't avoid thinking about the dozens of petitions I have signed         for years in defense of Afghan women, to expose their inhuman condition:         I wonder where those petitions landed, what we are to do for the forgotten         words.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....Let's keep on         writing about what is going on (inside, outside: is there a difference?)...striving         to find words to express it, to give a shape to these fragmentations.</font>       </p>      <p><a href="mailto:%20morresi.r@mercurio.it">morresi.r@mercurio.it</a></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>9/22/01</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>second excerpt         from Jo Ann Wasserman / NYC In response to Renata Morresi</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In response to Renata         Morresi, I agree that theory must move forward and is critical to our         sorting out process as we receive so much incorrect and non critical information         from the agents of mass media in the States. We certainly need sensitive         and revolutionary thinking right now. One thing that I was struck with         while attending the peace march last night was the insistent use (on the         part of the demonstrators) of dualistic language"Bush wants war, New         York wants peace!" or "justice: yes, war: no!"</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> My friend and I         tried to start a round of "we feel scared" and "dignity for humanity"         (doesn't scan well, I know) to no avail. If theory and critical discourse         could help us to move outside of binary thinking (or defining) as that         which we are against, rather than for, it would be transformative. What         I want is to be defined as FOR something, not always against. Even in         listening to the chant, "Peace not war," I wondered, "what does peace         mean right now?" The way things were on September 10th in New York City         as thousands of people woke up living on the street? The way things were         in Macedonia last year? On the Gaza Strip today? In the Sudan? In Pakistan?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Last Tuesday night         I felt like there was no place to go and feel "safe" for the night. It         is a strange feeling for me but I know many around the world and in the         States experience that all the time. A thought flashed through my mindI         wished it was New Year's Day so that I could attend the big, 24 hour marathon         poetry reading which takes place at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church         in New York City every year. I wanted to be there partly to be around         friends but also to be in a space of hearing poems, nonstop. I have been         thinking about the place poetry has in a situation like this one. How         the mysterious nature of that language might also be part of a response.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yesterday I heard         that On October 3rd there will be a group reading by about 50 poets (many         of whom are also critical writers) at St. Mark's. The idea is to respond         to recent events here. I don't know what people will read or say but I         am eager to find out.

Flags have long been a potent symbol of solidarity and         mourning. I think back to how Cathy Freeman carried the Aboriginal flag         in both Olympic games, symbolically reminding all in Australia and the         rest of the world of her history and Aboriginal Australians' continuing         presence. Her gesture was far more effective than any sentence she might         have spoken. And it seems to me, that for many Americans, the American         flag has had a similar function at this point of time. I'm not suggesting         here that a minority Australian proudly showing her 'colour/s' to the         world (while her country's government still fails to acknowledge or say         'sorry' for past injustices) is the same as an average American showing         the flag in his/her own yard. But that the flag is an outward sign or         gesture of solidary, gesturing in the American case a sympathy towards         those most affected by the events of 9/11.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At the same time,         I also find it dissettling. I am now constantly reminded that I am an         "alien" in the United States, that as a sign of solidarity, it excludes         me. I've noticed too that many have begun wearing ribbons in the colours         of the flag in the same way as there were AIDS ribbons, and apparently,         Gulf war ribbons. As a symbol, I think the ribbon, like the flag, focuses         on it being an "American" tragedy, that it elides the many non-Americans         who died in the World Trade Center collapses and the suffering of their         families. I realize that the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were         targets precisely because they were American icons, but in reinforcing         it as simply an American tragedy, the use of the flag or its colours as         a symbol merely encourages the objectives of such terrorism--to heighten         national and cultural divisions.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I think new approaches         to combatting terrorism must go beyond, as Jo Ann suggests, a simple dialectic         of peace vs. war, to some global coalition of the "civilized" against         an unknown other. More importantly, to actually rethink what the very         basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what it might         mean to be human today.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How to relate this         to writing, I'm less sure.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Lastly, I just wanted         to say how much I appreciated Renata's timely email about modernist writers         working through issues of politics and aesthetics in the face of fascism.         A different, though related set of issues, certainly arises in relation         to terrorism. Both, I think, are different again than the questions arising         in the face of a slow, sanctioned genocide such as occurred with the Holocaust,         arguably also happening in other parts of the world today. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:%20avickery@astro.temple.edu">avickery@astro.temple.edu</a></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>9/25/01 </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>from Kornelia         Frietag / Potsdam, Germany</b> </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am still confused,         and yet feel that I should finally somehow contribute to our exchange         about the terrible events of 2 weeks ago, even if I am relatively far         away in Germany, and have no one close in New York. Although my original         speechlessness has given way (had to give way) to efforts to talk with         my kids, my family, my friends, and colleagues, I am feeling a complete         inability to balance and to connect emotional and rational responses in         an acceptable way. I cannot manage this balancing act between (the expression         of) complete devastation, sadness, compassion, and helplessness on the         one hand, and an analysis of the political, historical, social, and religious         context on the other. But I am sure that it is this balancing act that         is most urgently needed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is needed because         the one without the other does not hold, or rather is extremely one-sided         if not dangerous. In Germany, at present, next to the hands on anti-terrorist,         measure-taking approach (be assured of U.S.anti-terrorist military support         + more police: cameras, security checks, screening etc.), the emotional         discourse (in words, gestures, actions, and symbols--all very material),         is the officially sanctioned one...as long as it is "for the U.S. not         against them." Hence my daughter and her classmates talked for hours in         class about the events per se, without any background information on Afghanistan,         Bin Laden, and/or the Middle East, but when a fellow student raised one         question about U.S. policy in the region, he was reprimanded and, for         the rest of the lesson, overlooked by the teacher who threatened to bring         him before the headmaster. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That two-thirds of         the former East German citizens--who have experienced their share of offical         binary interpretations of history and current events--are strongly opposed         to a war (on Afghanistan or any other "villain state") is mostly interpreted         as the expression of an insufficiantly developed sense of democracy and/or         latent anti-Americanism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Yesterday the culture         section of my local newspaper opened with a one page article on "The Cowardly         Thinking," claiming that German "artists and intellectuals flee into anti-American         prejudices." What the diverse intellectuals quoted there (in bits and         pieces, completely out of context) have done is: to put the events--in         Washington, New York and the Pittsburgh area--into a wider context of         US policy plus voicing the same fears of race hatred, vicious patriotism,         and militant jingoism that have been expressed in our e-mail discussion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The erronous logics         of a terrorism which takes the symbols of US global power (the World Trade         Center, the Pentagon) as material representation of the "evil" ("US imperialism")         and hence aggressively destroys them, is cynically repeated in a counter-attack         scenario (prescribed by the Bush government and followed by its allies,         Germany among them) which takes the very same symbols as material representation         of the "good" ("democracy", "civilization") as those to be aggressively         defended. It seems to me that the arbitrariness of symbols, the contextual         differences of meaning, the contingency of positions--historical, political,         social, gendered, ethnic, class-related--and the ambivalence of emotions         needs urgently to be thought about, talked about, written about before         and while re/acting to what undoubtedly was an onslaught on humanity,         a terrible, inhuman act.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is especially         hard to make (perceive and create an awareness of) a difference, or rather         to make differences in writing (the use of words and symbols) that subvert         the simplifying dominant discourse, when this very discourse is so emotionally         charged. And yet these differences need to be made, thought, spoken, and         written--risking the judgement of "cowardly thinking," rather than not         thinking at all.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Greetings and thanks         to all of you who are struggling to find (the) words,</font></p>      <p><a href="mailto:%20kfreitg@rz.uni-potsdam.de">kfreitg@rz.uni-potsdam.de</a></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>9/25/01 </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>excerpt from Linda         V.

Every direction is suspect.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I'm in Buffalo,         on the US/Canadian border. The day after 9/11 I tried to take a walk along         the Niagara River (our border) to find the otherwise well-trafficked area         all but empty except for scattered Vet-types with binoculars trained north....         My co-ambulator and I were advised against walking on the pier, which         had been my desire, because of a bomb threat to the Peace Bridge that         runs above it on over to Canada. It was eerie, we felt unsafe, and we         left. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We felt unsafe for         the next three days and never parted company, except to go to classes,         to teach, which was almost fruitless--on Thursday I cried, looking out         onto the tiny sea of my students to take attendance, just glad that they         were there. They were sobered, and we went on--I teach composition--and         learn we did. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> .... Basically,         I've been thinking, how would How2, if she could talk, want the Forum         to function? This is where we interpret her "constitution." While on the         one hand I value hearing intelligent women-poetry-thinkers critically         address all manner of issues--I love especially the way this forum, email,         lets those issues evolve, accelerate--I wonder how can this be brought         forward in a way that's true to How2's urgencies--to poetry and women?         And yet, oddly, Ann's suggestion that we need to "actually rethink what         the very basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what         it might mean to be human today" really urges me.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Perhaps that's not         so odd, though, when one considers how poetry is being cast about amidst         all the rhetoric of memorial and war in the U.S.. According to National         Public Radio, to be human and male is to write Poetry; to be female is         to talk and to grieve. Our only nationwide forum for news and culture,         NPR has brought poetry to the foreground, in the voices of Billy Collins,         Robert Pinsky, and, today, W.S. Merwin, offering profound reflection and         dour sentiments. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women, when they         form audible words, sound in untrained yet eloquent prose. These are the         wives left behind. What NPR forms is an apparently unbridgeable sexually-differentiated         cultural divide. At what point do contemporary women enter to define a         national/poetic response? We stand, like Greek women outside the gates         of the polis, mourning. Olson said to Carolee Schneeman when she went         out to Gloucester with her then partner in the late 60s, that it was when         the cunts began to speak that Greek tragedy began its decline. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Anne Carson's fascinating         essay "The Gender of Sound" illuminates: "Greek women of the archaic and         classical periods were not encouraged to pour forth unregulated cries         of any kind within the civic space of the polis or within earshot of men.         Indeed, masculinity in such a culture defines itself by its different         use of sound." I've often wondered what stake male poets have/had in "masculinizing"         their practice, keeping it pure of certain (read "feminizing") emotions.         I'm not essentializing here (women write "emotional" poetry), but just         noticing how the burden of emotion is often pushed onto women while at         the same time this burden is used as an excuse to prohibit women's cultural         production, where culture is seen to proceed in a rational, or in some         sense formalized, manner.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="mailto:%20lvrusso@acsu.buffalo.edu">lvrusso@acsu.buffalo.edu</a></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>9/28/01 </b></font></p>      <p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">excerpt from Arielle         Greenberg / Boston </font></b></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two issues I face         here and now: </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1) Spinning off of         Linda Kinnahan's remarks about what it means to be an innovative writer         who is also political: How to be a non-narrative poet in the face of such         REAL, linear surreality, you know? I don't even WANT to write about it         all, but it's the only thing I AM writing about, in one way or another,         and I feel slightly irresponsible for going sideways/non-linear rather         than being directly story-telling about it all. To this end, I am planning         to read Celan, whom I think of as a brilliant avant-garde reporter of         very direct and personal tragedy. Can anyone suggest other poets who have         done this, especially women poets?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 2) I am also thinking         a lot about what it means to be a global citizen. I am not so naive as         to think that America can or should pull out of all foreign policy...at         this point that's simply not realistic, nor is it generous. So how can         a country like the USA use its power for good instead of evil? How can         I be a part of urging it to do so?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I want to also note,         in regard to Linda K's comment about Pinsky (whom I almost always find         self-righteous), that I did hear a pretty good alternative to the voice         of HIStory when Boston's NPR call-in show, "The Connection," had a day         dedicated to the uses of poetry at times like these, and guests were Marie         Howe and Naomi Shahib Nye.... One of my favorite moments on that show         was when the (male) host brought Nye on the line, and instead of either         Howe or Nye addressing the questions at hand-- or the host--Nye said,         "Hello, Marie, I have been thinking of you in New York" and Howe said,         "Hello, Naomi darling, I have been thinking of you."

Ann's suggestion for the rethinking of 'what the very basis of         being civilized might mean...what it might mean to be human today' ties         in with my own concern regarding our (my) lack of understanding of how         such inhumane acts come to be perpetrated.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I was in China on         the 11th, in an area where we unable to receive CNN News, or indeed any         other English-speaking channel. Rumours abounded, and to see the TV images         with no commentary or explanation was terrifying. I rang my daughter in         London, and she told me what she knew of events. As we spoke, news reports         were coming in on her TV from the USA. She told me that a White House         spokesman was about to appear, and asked--did I want to hear what he was         saying? Hungry for any information, I replied in the affirmative and she         held the telephone receiver close to the TV. It was not what he said that         made me weep, but just that I suddenly became aware--in that moment--of         the distance that separated me from those I loved, of the enormity of         the atrocities that had been committed in New York and Washington, and         that what I was hearing formed just one small part of a historic unfolding         which could lead to more violence and unimaginable suffering throughout         the world.

Intimacy implies a         thorough knowledge of a limited body while that body continually renews         itself. The tension of the known occurs while stumbling upon unexpected         comminglings: collage: one atop another. Eros invites us to enter the         dim mystery of a pattern. It is a pattern, however, that is animate. The         known defies the familiar, so fluid. These contradictions of lived experience         arouse. Tension doesn't so much release as give, against itself, permissions.         Contra-Dictions. The body sometimes needs to go against the grain in order         to perceive the grain. So there's a gorgeous, voluptuous obstinacy in         pronouncing the unsayable. What is more palpable--breath, saliva, &c--than         the blurring of boundaries. These many forms, 'figurative' and literal,         make up the pattern of some shifting whole. So a body of work resounds         and resides with a body of desire. As desire beckons with its ultimately         tantalizing textures. The very pleasure of the word, the words, are their         life as a body and how they rub me the wrong way.</font> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">____________________</font>       </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="3">THE         PERILS OF GOING PUBLIC:</font></b><font size="3"><br>        <b>A 4-way conversation, collaged from emails between "postcard" editor,         Kathleen Fraser, and three readers</b></font></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <b>between         KF and Kelly Everding, Art Director <i>Rain Taxi</i> </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>KF's         question/ 1 . 18 . 01</b>: </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You write:         "I am an MFA grad from ten years ago (a survivor of sorts) who has forsaken         the academic life for something less volatile.

Would you have felt prohibited? Unconsciously         waiting for a personal and specific invitation? I ask because I've been         struck by the fact that in over 2 years of editing H2, the only persons         initiating "reviews" have been male, even though I thought H2 was proferring         an open invitation...

I assumed that if the place was created         and the descriptions of/invitations to different sections clear enough,         the space would be used very actively. Not true. It is in precisely this         area that work still needs to be done to further open up the range of         styles and voices --poets who might be interested in and willing to write         about their own takes on what they are reading, instead of leaving it         entirely up to the academic scholar/critics--many of whom are brilliant         and inventive, others who read, rather exclusively, from the perspective         of a very specific training & set of categories tending to leave out work         that doesn't "fit"....

I haven't yet managed to balance         my particular needs for privacy, focus, and modesty, with the authoritativeness         or exoticism that seem to be required for a public literary identity.         But then again some of that comes from the indifference with which the         work is often greeted. My ambitions are conflicted and not infrequently         discouraged. I've </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">invested         too much in feminist/leftist critique to say that my reticence is just         a function of my personality. On the other hand I've been slow to engage         that critique in a way that would bring my work into a more public discourse.         Yes, I've been afraid to be a more public writer; have maybe kept my work         more subjective, private.... Which has left me with the dissatisfying         feeling of being outside of any public dialogue.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> But my         version of what a public, political discourse might be may not be recognizable         to some. I'm suspicious of much conspicuously "political" writing and         its potential for dogmatism and reductiveness. I find politics in the         subtle, solitary acts of perception and the formation of cognitive structures         for apprehension and response. But the subtlety, the minutia, of such         activities may result in work that seems inert rather than arresting.         Or so I conclude, as I seem often to find myself mouthing inaudibly amidst         a thunderous din. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Undeniably         a "specific and personal invitation" is a motivation to enter the fray.         It's exactly that kind of interest that brings a sense of the work being         relevant to an audience, of its being a part of the larger writing/reading/         thinking world. I'm not one of those who's been able to convince myself         of a work's relevance without some sign from the outside. To a certain         degree, I think my writing project is about this very thing: the (often         vexed) relationship between the very private subject and the seemingly         remote power vectors that shape the social world. While the duality of         private/ public is discredited these days, I need to retain some distinction         like that to understand what's at stake in taking part in a public dialogue.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So---motivatedly,         Mary </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Note: For         direct link to <i>Narrativity</i> website, click on LINKS at bottom of         H2 home page.] </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">*</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Between         Grad Student and KF, Oct.

More on this later in this discussion. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I also need         to find a way to write "in public" about the kinds of issues you and I         have discussed in earlier emails. (Even revealing a previous one-on-one         discussion feels problematic!) I can see _your_ frustration, coming across         verbalized anxieties (issues) that often tangle us up in women's writing         and scholarship --but not being able to persuade us to write about them         in a form we'll allow to be made public. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The feeling         that it's "just me" is part of ithe problem, of course. It's not so much         that I always think my point-of-view isn't worth listening to, or that         it doesn't deserve to be heard. (To my surprise, I often feel quite confident         about my views, though of course that creates its own pressures.) The         basic issue is that I am the only woman in my program to voice dissatisfaction--consistently         and somewhat openly--about its gender politics. The program I am currently         a part of is one that has constructed its identity on the basis of oppositionality,         and requires that its students be loyal dissenters in supposedly hostile         territory: "If you're not for us; you're against us." So the intellectual         climate is very much"the fray" that Mary mentions, rather than any kind         of open arena or protected zone! </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A seemingly         "open space" is created that is full of invisible barriers. The odd thing         is that when someone bumps up against one of these, s/he becomes amazingly         and embarrassingly visible, fully clothed in whatever kind of identitarian         outfit suits the occasion. "Ah, we have a woman among us... (substitute         whatever other label you like). How nice that you can speak up!"</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In other         classes that I attend, issues of race, class, gender, sexuality come and         go as seems required by the subject under discussion and it isn't always         left to the "other-identified" (as opposed to "self-identified") minority         to speak up for themselves about whatever "their" issues are judged to         be. While theory can certainly be misused as a debating tool--i.e., "I         have a bigger, more famous, currently cooler theorist to apply to this         issue than you do!"--it can also provide a framework that, because it         is somewhat depersonalized, can allow push/pull and debate that goes beyond         identitarian boxing-in. This is what I see happening in the best of the         classes that I attend outside my own program. The risk, of course, with         that kind of approach is that "speaking from experience" can get censored-out.         In classrooms where I do feel comfortable enough to speak up, I try to         take a pride in speaking from experience as well as theory. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sitting         in a room full of smart, interesting people who consistently ignore certain         kinds of extremely important issues or assigned readings, and knowing         that unless "my" kind of person raises them they won't be raised--whereas,         if I do speak up, I'll be assumed to be speaking just because I am that         kind of person--is not only appallingly silencing, but also excruciatingly         frustrating. I leave the room and feel utterly drained with the effort         of (not) speaking. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It also         feels very lonely. The obvious answer to the situation I'm describing         is for a group of the "whatever" kind to get together and speak up and         support each other. But here I find myself in another kind of quandary         that is particularly hard to talk about in this context. One of the very         sad things about all this, especially for me, given the wonderfully supportive         female community I had while getting my MFA, was to see how the women         here get split apart and almost set against each other. For various personal         (?) reasons, few have seemed prepared to rock the boat. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A difficulty         for me in this situation is handling inter-generational feminist divides.         From my experience here, the woman student who is "non-traditional" (in         this context, older returning students) doesn't have much authority in         the lit crit or poetry classroom, She is, I suspect, seen as boring, mumsy,         and worst of all, "essentialist".</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Most perplexing         of all, if she also declares herself to be a feminist (how old-fashioned!),         she obviously hasn't read (as indeed I haven't--I was hoping for a class         here that would provide it!) the historical sequence of first-wave, second-wave,         etc., feminisms. It is very clear to me that in my program, women (among         other groups) are are not in a situation that encourages them to speak         up about issues that aren't on the currently "mainstream" agenda." To         say anything in the classroom--or to individuals, privately--that would         even hint at this observation would be seen as patronizing. How dare I         speak for someone else and make them look weak and naive? (As I write         this, I notice--and resent--the twist I find myself putting on all this:         not "this situation is bad," but "here's why this situation is so hard         for me".) </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I know that         none of this will be news to many women. It's just been a big lesson to         me--my hardest seminar last year was probably "gender politics". Having         spent so much of my work life, and then in my MFA program among highly         articulate and competent women scholars and professors, I came to realize         that up to that time, I'd been very sheltered in professional situations.         Even at work when, as happened not infrequently, I found myself "the only         woman" (certainly often the only college-educated one, and hence an anomaly!),         in business meetings, I never felt I was speaking "as a woman" (hence         boxed-in)...as has happened to me here. I was an oddity, but there was         respect for oddities, especially if they had some technical expertise.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of course         I have had some support, especially in private. But the worst hostility         I encountered here came after a few of us dared--openly-- to put together         a publicly identifiable united front. I now restrict myself to minimal         appearances at poetry arenas (though that subject is what I came here         to do!), and feel much more confident now that I'm not constantly exposing         (or not exposing!) myself. There have been some changes in the last year,         though, and more women have been entering this program, which has to be         a good thing! I can see some differences happening, as a result of that--I         notice that women's issues are discussed more...but still, from what I         hear, this happens mainly at the instigation of the women in the room.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About my         difficulty in expressing any of this in public (as opposed to privately):         that awkward business of seeming to speak for other people. How dare I         do that? I worry that perhaps I have got it all wrong, after all? What         right _have_ I got to voice an opinion, especially a public one? I badly         need to know that I've got it "right" . . . as if such a thing were entirely         possible!</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I actually         feel deeply anguished at being told that I've "misunderstood" or that         I just "don't get it". . . I can find a certain confidence (mentioned         earlier), but I know it's a bit of an act. Because it's an act, it feels         easily under-minable, and at the same time, I worry about its staginess         and its (necessarily?) forceful rhetoric, and the effect that this has         on the truthfulness of what I am saying?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I find         that a good deal of my best thinking is done through poetry, and I believe         that this is because there I am able to be truthful about the difficulties         inherent in writing--anything at all. That feels much more honest!</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Before         signing-off, I wanted to say something very quickly about some of the         practical things that stop me from taking part in this kind of public         debate. First there must be time and effort! This is the third or fourth         occasion in the last 8 months or so that I've done this kind of writing.         In each case, I felt I just had to get something out, forcefully, and         fast. Email is very pressurized--listserves particularly so, and particularly         competitive, too. Get something out now! Jump in before the next person!         A practical side of me says, yes, this is the only way to do this, while         you're burning hot with the issue, while there's interest in it, an occasion         for it. But this fights with the side of me that says, this is not how         effective work is done. You have to be able to edit, to have time to write         and come back fresh to revise. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The occasion         was there, the issues demanded it, and I felt fired-up and desperate to         make myself heard. But this is actually the hardest and most challenging         kind of writing I ever do. Far harder than writing academic papers! It         feels like running a race, or taking a very tightly timed exam. How best         to do justice to the occasion (and the people involved), and my anger,         and to be truthful to my insights and intuition, and at the same time         be as persuasive and clear as I can? Even done all in one day (as this         current piece is), it takes up huge amounts of time and emotional energy.         Today, I've put aside some long-overdue grading, just to give this thing         the time it needs, including going through its various layers: first emoting,         then trying to get to some more rational-sounding structure, some attempt         at balance (no one wants to sound shrill, or whiny), then editing for         diplomacy's sake (after all, this thing is public!).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Re being         invited--that certainly makes a big difference! But even then, and even         given less emotionally fraught material, it's genuinely difficult to make         the time. Even you had to ask me twice for a book review last year, and         I was so thrilled to be asked!! As I'm sitting here typing I'm trying         not to look at a second reminder to send some poems to a magazine. I guess,         having the space to speak may not be enough. (After all, the frustrating         classrooms I've described certainly looked open enough to begin with!)         I need invitations, structure, something to bounce off, and the emotional         resources that will help me key myself up to speaking-up and ignoring         my other commitments! I don't think well on my feet; would much rather         take things away and look at them quietly, digest them a bit, and then         come back and say my piece. But frustratingly, my current lifestyle won't         let me do that. Really a very basic aspect to being shut up! </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'm actually         very very angry that graduate school (in its PhD form) shuts me away from         all kinds of what I characterize as connecting, feminine parts of me --keeping         up with and being supportive to friends and family, taking part in exchanges         like this. I absolutely don't think the either/or sacrifice is a necessary         part of the choice, and I think it's especially hard on women!! Sorry         to go on and on about this--it's a very sore point right now. Add the         fear that I have in this place, isolated as I am, of cutting myself off         even more, and perhaps you have an answer to some of your questions?</font>       </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">____________________</font>       </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>1/24/01         </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">from Kristy         Anderson </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Zora         Hurston</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Film in         the works I thought you and your readers would like to know about a documentary         film on Zora Hurston for the Public Broadcasting System with major grants         from PBS, the NEA and the NEH.

But this         "scholarship" is slippery in tone: it's funny, but sometimes we mean it.         The whole project sits uneasily between fiction and documentary, and that's         the way we like it. (I am a writer, best known as the author of the acclaimed         hypertext 'novel' Patchwork Girl; my sister is an independent scholar         with a PhD in rhetoric from UC Berkeley, so this hybrid work is a kind         of amalgam of our interests.) </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is         an ongoing project, and it's still in an early stage. Right now it revolves         around our own doll games, but over time, we hope the site will expand         to include a vast section of contributions from other women (though we         will we welcome men too) who have good stories to tell about their own         childhood doll games.

Printed in a run of 200 copies, the text was slightly         flawed, and the book never reprinted. In 2001, the Laura Riding centenary,         <i>Delmar</i> magazine will reprint a correction of the original text,         along with responses to it by poets and critics, Riding scholars and<i>         Delmar</i>'s past-contributors. The work received absolutely no attention         in its initial commercial life.<i> Delmar</i> then invites the participation         in this project of interested Riding readers. Responses of under 2500         words must be submitted by December 31, 2000.

At the University using the         same procedures, I get page showing #4 as current issue. I have no idea         why this is happening? My computer at university is more powerful--but         I have a fairly good computer at home, too--and in both cases am using         UW internet services, so. . . --Jeanne Heuving, U. of Washington (Bothell/Seattle)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>10/13/00</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Jeanne,         I've just tried searching for HOW2 through numerous search engines. One         of them (Yahoo!) turned up an archived issue (on the Rutgers webserver).         All the other searches turned up the correct one. When I searched through         Lycos, I found the current issue when searching Lycos, Infoseek, Northern         Light, Dogpile, Google, Ask Jeeves, Alta Vista, Direct Hit, HotBot, Go.com.         In all cases How2 appeared within the first page of results, and often         it was first or second. This looks pretty healthy to me, so I'm not sure         I need to do anything to "fix" it.

Every time you load         a web page, your computer stores a temporary version of that page so that         if you call it up again, it will load faster. Your webserver at work might         be regularly emptied, but you have to empty it manually at home. If you         use Internet Explorer, click on "TOOLS," then "INTERNET OPTIONS." In the         middle it says: Temporary Internet Files. Click on "Delete Files," then         click the "okay" at the bottom If you use Netscape, chose "EDIT" then         "PREFERENCES." On the left side, at the bottom, it will say "ADVANCED."         Click on the Plus sign beside advanced. Click on the word "CACHE." Click         on the button that says "CLEAR MEMORY CACHE," then click "OK". Now click         on the button that says "CLEAR DISK CACHE" and click "OK." Click "OK"         one more time. Now try typing in the exact URL <font color="#FF0000">http://www.departments/bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2</font>         and see if you get the currect issue (#4).
