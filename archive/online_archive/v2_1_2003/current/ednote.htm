        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">In “Drafts 44: Stretto,” Rachel Blau DuPlessis 
          writes of a disparity between experience and perception while sounding 
          a call to poetry’s material capacities: “Thought is frightened / for 
          it can’t think anywhere near the size of what has happened / to bring 
          <u>is</u> forth and set it rolling out.” She continues her exploration 
          of poetical responses and responsibilities by invoking a “glinting world” 
          whose clouded skies are “tangled in the long veil of the page,” and 
          completes her meditation by gendering a curious and urgent “gift” of 
          fear:</p>

          in New Writing)<o:p></o:p> </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">For many writers and artists in this edition of 
          <i>HOW2</i>, DuPlessis’s words hold singular and troubling currency. 
          Relations between congested material occurrences and poetry’s timing 
          — between our descriptions and our perceptions of the world as it appears 
          to unfold — are crucial to the texts and visual works that congregate 
          at this issue’s mis/fitting seams. Since <i>HOW2</i>’s Fall 2002 edition, 
          an ongoing war has been declared and carried out against and within 
          Iraq by a coalition of political and media forces including the governments 
          of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. “Sometimes I 
          can’t see clearly,” writes Geraldine McKenzie in the first of two New 
          Writing features. “[T]his light sun of forgone conclusions drives the 
          day / bitter pace and headlong into what never ceases / work which was 
          punishment due our hard place / the squandered skirts of heaven… / it’s 
          raining and the world comes out to watch.” Or as DuPlessis observes, 
          equally acute in another context, thought is frightened, for it can’t 
          think anywhere near the size of what has happened. How other than in 
          kinds of fright are we to approach the Bush administration’s “New American 
          Century”?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Thought also is revitalized and made sharp by such 
          blunt events. As writers and thinkers “we’re called to run a time <u>behind</u>, 
          <u>upon</u>, <u>within</u>, <u>inside</u> / plus <u>of</u> that scroll.” 
          This might be the gift to which DuPlessis refers: a gift of critical 
          calling, not predatory upon political spectacle and catastrophe, but 
          finding ways to acknowledge and apprehend them — despite (and to resist) 
          their near-normalization via a profound array of everyday rhetorical 
          strategies. Carla Harryman offers this in “The Ear of the Poet in the 
          Mouth of the Performer,” featured in Kathleen Fraser’s “Resisting Type” 
          In-Conference panel:</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>The challenge of writing anything has been at stake 
          for me since the U.S. response to 9/11 became an excuse to militarize 
          against Iraq. The pleasure in the idea that I could be writing about 
          my own art activity and its genre excesses is contradicted by the loss 
          of a sense of what? Form? Desire? Motivation? What do I mean by a loss 
          of a sense of form-desire?…Or perhaps what I am experiencing is not 
          exactly a loss of a sense of form-motivation, but the signal of a breaking 
          point.<o:p></o:p></div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">We must ask these questions, even as we sometimes 
          feel their inadequacies, or mistrust the point of doing so. They are 
          questions <i>in</i> and <i>about</i> contexts for our writerly and scholarly 
          labors. They make a political address to the how and here of knowing. 
          How might community-based poetry and art projects like <i>HOW2</i> respond 
          to such breaking points, and what kinds of signals do we mean to transmit? 
          In current political weathers “the challenge of writing anything” — 
          a challenge embodying vastly different scales of action, impact, place 
          and experience — is undeniably “at stake.”</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">This edition of <i>HOW2</i>, the first in a second 
          online volume, includes dozens of different and edgy tussles with “breaking 
          points.” A break is partly a beginning. It can provoke new currents 
          of thinking and radical revisions of what has passed already, while 
          stressing matters of form and method. In “Networking Women: an Instance,” 
          Renata Morresi cites Nancy Cunard’s notion of “the underneath of history” 
          as a stepping-off point for a feminist revision of London-based modernist 
          journal <i>Life and Letters To-Day</i>, focusing on the editorial influence 
          of Bryher (born Winifred Ellerman). Morresi’s work appears in the second 
          of our In-Conference features, “Networking Women: Subjects, Places, 
          Links Europe-America 1890-1939,” alongside complementary revisionist 
          accounts of modernist cultural, sexual and publication economies by 
          Marina Camboni, Diana Collecott and Gigliola Sacerdoti Mariani. Collecott’s 
          “Another Bloomsbury: Women’s Networks in Literary London during World 
          War One” reminds us that certain narratives <i>need</i> to be broken 
          so that we might recover “the buried, the wasted and the lost,” as Mariani 
          writes — stories of living from history’s underside that are obscured 
          too easily in the competitive and powerful babble of conventional and 
          complacent literary myth-making.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Julia Lisella’s Readings on American modernist 
          Genevieve Taggard continue the project of excavation and witness. Under 
          a rubric of “the Genevieve Taggard effect,” Alison Van Nyhuis critiques 
          “the marginalization of poets or the production of canonical/poetic 
          misfits <i>because </i>their body of work does not squarely rest on 
          either side of a literary divide.” She calls for holistic interrogations 
          of anthologizing processes, which consider the life conditions and artistic 
          intentions of specific writers rather than imposing upon them “our own 
          discursive confections” — whether we lionize them as exemplary renegades, 
          or censor them into conformity. Catherine Daly unpicks several of Taggard’s 
          little-circulated pamphlet poems, while Nancy Berke scrutinizes “ideologies 
          of aging” and volatile exchanges between private lyrics and public functions 
          in Taggard’s poetry, including socio-economic class categories and racially 
          biased citizenship roles within 1930s America.</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Category-panic is central to Anne Jamison’s account 
          of Virginia Woolf’s and Ezra Pound’s contrasting recuperations and repudiations 
          of Christina Rossetti’s sometime “modern cadence.” Jamison questions 
          the exclusivity and gendered convenience of genre demarcations: what 
          happens if we re-imagine Rossetti as an influential modern, by exposing 
          established hierarchies of “modernist” aesthetic and formal properties? 
          Other pieces from Alerts tackle these ideas in contemporary scenarios. 
          Jane Sprague observes how Arielle Greenberg’s “rich, collaged textual 
          world of glossy pop culture surfaces” presents an assortment of female 
          subjects who strategically manage to “sustain themselves and exist in 
          a jangled world of blurred edges, ruptured syntax and shifting subjectivity.” 
          Laura Hinton recommends “expand[ing] beyond well-grooved arguments about 
          the lyric, and mov[ing] the topic of experiment into experimental forms, 
          like the prose poem and intergenre, poems that are no longer clearly 
          ‘lyric’ anymore.” Genre is splitting at the seams — and with it, neat 
          periodizations that retreat into sameness when faced with threatening 
          difference. Broken narrations offer choices: how literally to proceed, 
          once comfortably acceptable forms are interrupted or abandoned or recast? 
          Which structures are brought to light, and which lights will be visible?</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Both New Writing segments work with problems of 
          form and alterity. In “Inappropriated Others,” Dodie Bellamy is explicit 
          about erotic taboos and encounters involving “lovers drawn to inappropriate 
          beloveds,” as Jeanne Heuving writes. “I watch fat men now, this secret 
          ostracized world of ridicule and invisibility. I feel scorn for the 
          mainstream, the hip, the cool.” (Bellamy) Kevin Killian parodies confessional 
          and hetero-normative desiring modes in his panegyric to Kylie Minogue, 
          while Christine Stewart tests limits of fantasy and corporeal risk in 
          “St. Augustine”: “I consider a certain point on the screen. / I cover 
          up one slit. I find the nonzero. // Habit descends unexpectedly / in 
          my florid sleep, // in ripe / folding / civility…/ I cradle in / the 
          remembering / of / gender. / I shred / the pink / borderless / tongue.” 
          Sound artist and visual poet Amanda Stewart shreds different forms and 
          coordinates in excerpts from “I/T,” featured in Pam Brown’s selection 
          of contemporary innovative work: “He would go spiritually with humility 
          / the / re the / her, goddesspollutedwhoresaint, and he / would save 
          her! The clean attractive would be / saved!”</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">Sawako Nakayasu’s feature on contemporary Italian 
          poetry suggests diverse “breaking points” that are met during translational 
          processes. With thanks to the collaborative work of at least fifteen 
          writers and translators, we offer a series of stunning Italian poems 
          alongside their English counterparts. Milli Graffi unravels her lines 
          in a fold between inner and outer, undoing “the privilege of reticence” 
          to write: “In the indentation of the final hollow // a voice burrows 
          itself // in the privilege of reticence / last coat of the beast-like 
          heat // before the outside splinters // and ESCAPES.” Sylvia Bortoli’s 
          pared lyricism gives the act of thinking an arresting and sensual physicality: 
          “Open your mind and lean / on the indigo your thought / like a light 
          finger / which softly probes the body / of words / and follows / the 
          hare’s / anxious flight.”</p>
        <p class="Doublespace"></p>
        <p class="Doublespace">These are just some of the pleasures, serious deliberations 
          and subversive humors of the new <i>HOW2</i>. I briefly want to acknowledge 
          several other breaks, and to extend gratitude and thanks to various 
          people. This issue makes a transition to a new editorial team. Ann Vickery 
          has completed four issues as editor and leaves the role, while London-based 
          innovative writer and scholar Dell Olsen joins us as managing editor 
          and I begin as editor. Ann worked tirelessly to expand the international 
          focus and spirit of the journal, remaining committed along the way to 
          local acts of experimentation and feminist practice. We are fortunate 
          to gain Dell’s considerable energies and experience as we renew <i>HOW2</i>’s 
          creatively challenging and necessarily adversarial project, and think 
          about the ongoing usefulness of internet journals as sites of play, 
          controversy and exchange. Roberta Sims continues as <i>HOW2</i>’s web-designer 
          and I would like to thank her for lending so much time and creative 
          input to the magazine. Finally and especially, thank you to founding 
          editor Kathleen Fraser for generous advice and assistance during <i>HOW2</i>’s 
          transitional months; to all associate editors and contributors who worked 
          on this issue; and to a growing community of readers, whose ideas always 
          direct our directions.</p>
