      <P CLASS="TITLE2">Working Note</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1990, as I drove through the South where I was 
        going to live, I was decontextualized. Here I was, a Parisian driving 
        an old Chrysler Imperial LeBaron, stopping to take Polaroid’s of “Baits 
        and Tires” shops, Kudzu, cotton flowers and dead trees rooted in bayous. 
        The Southern accent took me by surprise and forced me to question this 
        America and my knowledge of the English language to become an active participant 
        in its production. And in the production of my life. Why had I expected 
        a permanent meaning? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Inevitably, my writing is about the function of language 
        in the constitution of the nature of reality and the nature of the individual 
        and most certainly, my own nature, which is to be decontextualized. Thus 
        I embrace <i>Ostranenie </i>— making strange, playing with the degree 
        to which signs are contextualized by use, defamiliarizing through exploration 
        of the lexicon and decontextualization of familiar words as well as unfamiliar, 
        foreign words — to reach and question the substantiality of language and 
        the nature of meaning. I am also obsessed with finding <i>le mot juste</i> 
        in English and reflecting the schizophrenia of our time through sound 
        and a sense of speed.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> “Angel and Puppet” stems from shopping for groceries 
        with my daughter around Valentine’s and reading Rilke’s <i>Duino Elegies</i>. 
        Each time we saw a new Valentine’s item, we said “watch out, your sweetheart,” 
        which led to a series of repetitions such as “wait until we get home,” 
        or “wait, don’t open it in the car,” and eventually to this poem in which 
        I interjected words from the “Fourth Elegy.” “Errancy,” “Calisthenics,” 
        and “Poetics” are abecedarians, which is a form I have worked with quite 
        faithfully for a couple of years. I like the rigidity of this form because 
        it forces me to work within it, yet it liberates me from all expected 
        rationality as I have to start each line with a successive letter of the 
        alphabet. When writing abecedarians, I often focus on two or three threads 
        that I weave through the poem. In “Errancy,” for instance, the threads 
        are my trip to Europe after living in the States for eleven years, the 
        effect of globalization, and sexuality. I always write a poem while playing 
        music, and quickly the music ends up being a particular CD that I play 
        over and over thus lyrics from the CD end up in the poem as did “<i>c’est 
        le côté obscure de la force</i>” in “Errancy” (from <i>JE DANCE LE MIA</i> 
        by IAM). Also, while writing, a line from Beckett, Fargue, Stein, Breton, 
        etc. pops up and wants to stay, so I check the source and add it to the 
        poem. Sometimes, I add another restriction to the form as in “Calisthenics” 
        where I decided to repeat most of the words twice in the poem. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Eternity Scorned” is my 9/11 poem as I lived it 
        in the South. Overnight, signs popped up all over town, and the juxtaposition 
        of a business’s name with the patriotic message from that business resulted 
        in things like, LUCY’S WINGS BLESS AMERICA or WE STAND UNITED FRIED CHICKEN. 
        I played with the idea and looked in the local paper for patriotic adds. 
        Later on, I attended Elizabeth Grosz’s inspiring lecture on the force 
        of sexual difference and decided to mix excerpts from her lecture with 
        these effusions of patriotism. As for “Histrionics,” I tried to give a 
        dramatic representation of the world around me at the time, again from 
        waiting in line with my daughter at the grocery store, finding our car 
        in the parking lot, picking up the mail, reading magazines, stopping at 
        the university, and remembering an old acquaintance who was a lawyer.
