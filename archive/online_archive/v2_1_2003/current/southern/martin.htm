      <P CLASS="TITLE2">Working Note</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In many poems in the sequence <i>fabled hue</i>, 
        I worked with various kinds of repetition. In “why a memory of birds,” 
        for example, I use anaphoric repetition, beginning each sentence with 
        the same type of grammatical construction. In “below leaves words,” it 
        is sound patterns that are repeated. In the poems in <i>hummer flumes</i>, 
        I scavenged some of my dream journals from several years ago. Images and 
        events in the dreams were subjected to various types of manipulations 
        and experiments. Here, too, the use of repetitions sometimes guided the 
        compositional process.&nbsp;</P>

                  between happiness and reason at the time of the knock at the 
                  door. as an invitation to flawed movements or familiar quotes

                  solving math problems in the middle of a restless hesitation 
                  among bleak and pretended optimisms. within a self that conforms 
                  to the shape of the skin i am not wiser to a flaming heart.

                  dust flies sparkling along the disaffected continuum. i am not 
                  the light glancing off a large looming object after the crooked 
                  war starting out for the difficult world. i am nothing to do 
                  with a recap of tinsel events in the shambles of a happy swagger. 
                  i am nothing like that happy swagger eating wild strawberries 
                  within sight of the finish line. i am not where can be found 
                  a bright holy braid in a junk village morgue. nothing of birdsong 
                  heard over the radio, nothing of defunct crocus blossoms, nothing 
                  of overused infinity minus gullible windows, nothing in an undertow 
                  of the amazon river choked with banana peel and empty suitcase 
                  jetsam. i am nothing cruising the margins of an antique map, 
                  nothing looking into time in an animal’s eyes. i am nothing 
                  expelled from the university of dirt clods.</p>
