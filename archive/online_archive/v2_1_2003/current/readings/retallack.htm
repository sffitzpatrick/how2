        Waldrop</P>
<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>

      <div class=Section1>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">[This is the second half of a conversation, begun 
          in 1991 with later revisions, mostly about Rosmarie Waldrop’s two novels, 
          <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> and <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It All</i>. 
          The first half of the conversation was published in <i>Contemporary 
          Literature </i>40.3 (Fall 1999).] </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: It’s not a given that a writer, having done 
          a particular kind of book, would — like you — then try to do something 
          completely different. Of course, the writer whose next book is similar 
          to previous ones might say the level or critical degree of difference 
          is in some other aspect of the work, that it's a more subtle difference.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That is true. There are writers who explore 
          in depth, rather than in “width.” They go over the same territory again 
          and again, digging deeper and deeper. Jabés does that. And Beckett. 
          But apparently I’m more interested in surfaces, in going sideways, rather 
          than deep.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: The way I would say it is that you are more 
          interested in form. But then what does that mean? I read an essay several 
          years ago in the journal <i>Genre</i> by a Chinese American scholar 
          who said that, in contrast to the West, Chinese culture is entirely 
          preoccupied with form, that the Chinese are “born into” a sensitivity 
          to form. But again what does that mean? Something spatial, perhaps, 
          more than temporal. For a book of poetry or prose, it might be as simple 
          as the graphics of the page — ratios and relations of white space to 
          print, placement of words. Just leafing through your two novels one 
          can already see that things are arranged differently from the norm of 
          the novel. The space is occupied, or unoccupied, in different ways. 
          One sees that kind of thing in <i>Tristram Shandy </i>— there are symbols 
          inserted, a page is covered in black, an entire chapter consists of 
          one short sentence... Or in Gertrude Stein’s poetic novel <i>Blood on 
          the Dining-Room Floor. </i>So, if you think of form in one of its aspects 
          as a framework defining boundaries, like any frame its presence draws 
          attention, helps you focus on what it sets off in a particular way.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right, or better, form as intersection, rather 
          than something that contains. That’s the model I prefer. There are different 
          ways in which the materials intersect each other, and intersect the 
          page. It’s Pound’s idea of form as “a center around which, not a box 
          within which.” Which is also Merleau-Ponty’s definition of both form 
          and space: “not the <i>space in which</i>, but the <i>means through 
          which.</i>”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So, for instance where you are using captions 
          for sections — ?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It signals “jump.” Except that — I see here 
          “Elegy Continued.” So, the captions also establish continuity across 
          other sections. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: A way to keep in motion the play between different 
          levels of disjunction and continuity.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Which the whole book plays with in a variety 
          of ways. One of the things I loved was the recurrent, very precise anatomical 
          description of gestures — a muscular precision that makes them both 
          very specific and entirely generalizable, simultaneously meaningful 
          and oddly empty. And that pertains to the kind of formal sense I was 
          referring to before. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: On one level this undercuts narrative one-dimensionality 
          in Musil-style. I give a whole web of anatomical information instead 
          of saying “he lifted the cup to his mouth.” But gesture also interested 
          me as a form of communication that would seem to carry across boundaries 
          of language and culture. Though even the gestures are coded. The Spaniards 
          and Indians probably made as many mistakes interpreting gestures as 
          interpreting words. I wanted to take it back to the level of the body, 
          of muscle and tissue. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: If you think about historical narrative, not 
          many gestures get recorded. It’s the particle that doesn’t wave, a micro-level 
          in history. At some point in reading this I started to think of all 
          the billions of people on the planet making gestures over time and thereby 
          determining the course of history.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: And half of them women. There is, in <i>A Form/ 
          of Taking/ It All</i>, a whole strand from Frank Wedekind’s novella, 
          <i>Mine-Haha</i> <i>or the Physical Education of Girls. </i>He posits 
          a society in which the girls are brought up purely as bodies. They learn 
          to dance and to play music, nothing else. Then they’re sacrificed to 
          some God. This story has haunted me. Never mind that Wedekind distances 
          it by placing it in Aztec society. This separation of mind and body 
          — and defining them as male and female! When the <i>connection</i> between 
          mind and body is so much more interesting than the famous gap — which, 
          I’m happy to read, seems to be closing in favor of the body. Psychologists 
          like Damasio seem to ground all thought in “somatic markers,” “body-representing 
          neural structures.” So that there is no such thing as “pure thought” 
          — which is what my German schooling seemed oriented toward. I love getting 
          the body into my writing, especially to subvert ideas like “pure thought.” 
          At the same time I’m of course allergic against the stereotype, of the 
          woman as sheer body. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: The body usually enters in a rather fragmentary 
          way. Either concentrating on a part of the body or a particular motion 
          of the body. Or in the sorts of things that you do with mid-sentence 
          shifts from the intellectual to the sensual. Whole bodies rarely make 
          an appearance. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Is that true? </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Those odd, isolated gestures detached as they 
          are from any pretense of the kinds of deterministic fictions driven 
          by full-blown characters seem to punctuate in a very piquant way all 
          that is not pretensein this book. The relief from seamless narration, 
          for instance. From authorial omniscience. In their place in <i>A Form/ 
          of Taking/ It All</i> is this wonderful choreography of the immense 
          energy of intellect and imagination that needn’t deny the gaps since 
          it’s capable of transmitting across them. There’s something very strong 
          and moving about all those people waving from fragmentary accounts across 
          centuries and cultures. Sort of like the image of the arm sticking out 
          of the water with everything else submerged.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s a great image! So much is always submerged. 
          All we get are little glimpses. Of S.O.S. signals! Yes, the arm out 
          of the water is just right.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: All of which would be lost — that sense of 
          energized particles, particulars of history that could send waves in 
          many directions were you to engulf everything in a tidal wave of your 
          own narrative intentionality. Interestingly, I’m finding now as we talk 
          about this that I have a heightened sense of the play of the particle 
          in your structure [even before the last section where Columbus sails 
          toward “Unpredicted Particles” and continents] — the sense of the play 
          of particulars, the little coincidences that occur in the mind of the 
          person thinking about history. Author as participant observer whose 
          presence is continually swerving the energy from unpredicted particle 
          meeting particle in the constantly interrupted narrative consciousness 
          to produce the momentarily coherent wave. On page 80, section 2, you 
          write:</p>

        <p>These were all very slight experiences, of course, but they happened

      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, the indeterminacy of all the particulars 
        in relation. One reason why I wanted the initial section to be “A Form 
        of Vertigo,” feverishness, was that it is a state where the particulars 
        lose their boundaries. Also the vertigo of the mind when you make very 
        rapid connections. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Ah, the flaming wave? A hot/cold tension between 
        wave and particle? I think it’s important to identify the form of the 
        poetics here, the precise motions of language and thought and image that 
        attract and repel, intersect and travel parallel to one another. When 
        you’re doing something that you are labeling generically — “novel” — while 
        diverging from certain practices that have come to be seen as defining 
        that very genre — character and plot development for instance. What might 
        be experienced by the reader new to innovative forms is a sense of loss 
        — the absence of the familiar orientations. And even outrage that “the 
        whole story” is being withheld. And yet, delightfully, this is called 
        <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It <u>All</u></i>![emphasis added] At least one 
        of the operative words in this title must be “it.” This is clearly a different 
        “it” from what usually is taken to be the domain of the novel — the fully 
        fleshed-out content of a story, told with the beat by beat pulse of “real 
        life,” bracketed by the decorum of a beginning and an end.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, definitely this “it” is something else! Creeley’s 
        poem has intrigued me for many years, partly because you have a semantic 
        change each time you go to another line. First: “mind is a form,” then 
        “mind is a form of taking,” and then “mind is a form of taking it all”! 
        A wonderful progression. But I think the “it all” is really “it All”! 
        All of experience, all of tradition, all that there is, <i>Alles was der 
        Fall ist.</i> Keats’s mind as “a thoroughfare for <i>all </i>thoughts.” 
        And of course it’s impossible to <i>take</i> it all. But a form that would 
        <i>attempt</i> taking it all, or in Beckett’s words, which you often quote, 
        attempt “accommodating the mess.” This grandiose ambition!</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In talking earlier about <i>TheHanky of Pippin’s 
        Daughter</i>, you said you were very clear about the need to unload things, 
        to get rid of this initial impulse of getting it all in. And we talked 
        about that as way of submerging a story that was hard to tell. But here, 
        there is a difference. You don’t have that very personal story to tell. 
        It’s a different field of experience and ideas that you’re drawing from. 
        So one might think there could be a less inhibited impulse to “take it 
        all.” And yet, this is a much sparer book than <i>Hanky</i>. Is this a 
        form of “less is more”? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I hope so! A smaller book, with a wider frame. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You are setting some very active particles in 
        motion which are sort of bouncing off each other and the reader, at least 
        this was my experience, could have a sense of expansiveness, that there 
        was always much more than had glanced onto and off the page. When I put 
        this down my mind was in a very active, connecting mode. I was noticing 
        particles of experience outside your text. It happened that I was reading 
        this at Bard and that I had to put it down at one point to go to a meeting. 
        On my way to the building where the meeting was to occur I realized that 
        I felt as though I were walking through the space in the book, or that 
        the space opened up in the book literally gave onto the world outside 
        it. This was partly the fact that I was walking with the rhythm and method 
        of observing and thinking that <i>is</i> the poetics of this book. I had 
        been initiated into that structural process through the engagement of 
        reading it.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, I’ve had that kind of experience. For instance, 
        with Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge’s work — when I lived a kind of extension of 
        the thought process that she sets going. But, you know, as far as it being 
        a small book, I didn’t plan that. It’s simply that the impulse, the energy 
        that set it in motion gradually wore down.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And yet, you worked on the other book for eight 
        years.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s true. So there are two possibilities: 
        either I went beyond the point when I should have stopped, or the impulse 
        can be there for a long time, even across interruptions. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I wonder too if part of that isn’t that the impulse 
        gets realized somehow. That the impulse gets consumed in the realization. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That is what one hopes, but one can never be 
        sure.&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’d like to talk with you, in relation to both 
        of the novels, to all of your work really, about your reference in “Alarms 
        and Excursions” to Georges Bataille’s aesthetic of transgression and glorious 
        waste — excess energy. You are talking about poetry in that essay as a 
        waste of excess energy. Which for Bataille is not limited to poetry; it’s 
        a theory of the excess of art.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Not even limited to art. He puts the Gothic cathedrals 
        and the potlatch ceremony in parallel. Which shocked me at first. The 
        potlatch is no doubt a glorious ritual, but it is sheer destruction. Still, 
        the process, the wasting of energy, is what is glorious whether there 
        remains a result — a cathedral, an artifact — or not. His theory — that 
        the sun’s energy is in excess of maintaining life; so that, when a system 
        can grow no more, the excess energy has to be lost without “profit,” spent 
        gloriously or catastrophically — is the only theory that explains the 
        persistence of art, especially of arts like poetry where there is little 
        tangible “profit.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You also write about the distinction between 
        the warrior society and the military society.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s also Bataille’s distinction. The military 
        society is a business enterprise that wages war for a purpose, expansion 
        of territory and the like. Whereas the warrior society fights for the 
        heck of it, for the sake of fighting, for the glory of some god. I find 
        it hard to choose between them, except when I think of them as metaphors 
        for artists. Then I join Bataille on the side of the “warrior”: the writer 
        for whom the essential is the writing, the intensity of the process, of 
        the present moment, the glory of making a poem, rather than on the side 
        of the businessman-poet who writes as an investment, building a career. 
        Though nobody can be “pure”...</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you see poetry as a more glorious waste than 
        prose?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Definitely. Prose still has a potential of earning 
        money; whereas poetry does not. So, it’s much “purer” waste. True, there 
        are jobs in academe that go to poets. But still, a novelist can theoretically 
        expect to make a living by his work. But not even <i>bad</i> poets can.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There are one or two exceptions.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Rod McKuen? Kahlil Gibran? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes. In <i>A Key Into the Language of America</i>, 
        you’ve talked about having found yourself always on the side with the 
        power in various historical contexts. In Germany, you were not a Jew; 
        in the United States you are not a native American. But, there is one 
        quite striking sense in which you are not automatically bequeathed cultural 
        power. You are a woman.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s the kind of contradiction that I try to 
        apply to the conquest of America by Europeans in <i>A Key. </i>My empathy 
        is with both sides. As a woman — and a poet! I am one of the underdogs, 
        but race and education place me among the “conquerors.” This was rubbed 
        in very shortly after I came to the US, in early 1959. When I mentioned 
        to a black fellow student that I was from Germany his comment was: “And 
        you can go anywhere in this country.” One of the things that intrigues 
        me about the conquest of America is that the very masculine Indian culture 
        was put in the position of the conquered female. I’m actually dubious 
        about the gendering of activities, but those archetypes do play into our 
        thinking. The conquest model is the man taking the woman. &nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What about your role — though you may not think 
        of it in terms of “role” — as a woman writing experimental fiction? I 
        think this is much more unusual right now than a woman writing experimental 
        poetry. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: As you say, I don’t think of it as a role. I’m 
        not a fiction writer. I write. Mostly poems. I try to pay attention to 
        words. Occasionally they push into prose. And maybe it means pushing still 
        a little farther out into the margin.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I have some problems with the “margin” trope. 
        It seems to presuppose a monolithic central text and I don’t think the 
        complexity of our cultural milieu looks like that, but I accept it as 
        your image. So, thinking in terms of marginality, might that be why most 
        women novelists tend not to engage in radical experiments with the form? 
        The novel has been a traditional way up the cultural power ladder for 
        women. And it’s usually a project of much longer duration than a poetry 
        project. It must be additionally frightening to imagine oneself even farther 
        out in the margin <i>and</i> on such a long, precarious, time-consuming 
        exploration.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I don’t think I can speak about “most” women 
        novelists. I’m not even a “novelist.” But there <i>is</i> a distinguished 
        line of women who have experimented with the novel form, from Gertrude 
        Stein on: Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy. 
        Recently Leslie Scalapino, Lyn Hejinian. The term “stream of consciousness 
        novel” was coined by Dorothy Richardson. No, wait, by May Sinclair <i>about</i> 
        Richardson’s work. Whereas now when you mention stream of consciousness 
        novel the reflex is Joyce. But your gendering [elsewhere] of “normative 
        declarations” reminds me: When Charles Bernstein put together the series 
        of talks that was collected as <i>The Politics of Poetic Form,</i> he 
        proposed as starting point a pair of dicta on poets as “legislators”. 
        Shelley’s “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world” and 
        Oppen’s “Poets are the legislators of the unacknowledged world.” Oppen 
        nicely turns Shelley on his head, but neither questions the equation poet 
        = legislator. I found this means nothing to me. I think of poets as language-maintenance 
        crew! Though obviously, while I write I do lay down the rules. At least 
        within the boundaries of my work, I legislate. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, and that role is foregrounded for the innovative 
        writer who is actually inventing some new rules or at least reformulating 
        generic traditions.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But I don’t feel everybody has to do the same 
        thing. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, that is your thinking about the world as 
        a multiplicity of individuals writing — the more differences the merrier. 
        But legislative thinking is political and strategic thinking. It’s about 
        marking territory and reorganizing the power structure in the public sphere. 
        Or at least reorienting it to one’s advantage.&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Bataille’s glorious waste again. The essential 
        is the <i>present</i> intensity of the process rather than practical concerns 
        about the <i>future</i>. Of course, at some point we have to help our 
        work find an audience. But<i> while writing</i> it seems essential to 
        keep the business considerations out. To make possible what you are talking 
        about, that reckless freedom. To hell with the audience! Let the dialogue 
        with the language take you wherever it wants. You remember Benjamin’s 
        “Art posits man’s physical and spiritual existence, but in none of its 
        works is it concerned with his response. No poem is intended for the reader, 
        no picture for the beholder, no symphony for the listener.” [This is far 
        from the pressures of the “market place”.] Once, in a Rothko retrospective, 
        I was struck by the division in the work. The early work had an immense, 
        wonderful variety. Then he settled into one basic configuration and explored 
        color. Nelson Howe, the artist friend I was with, attributed this to the 
        art market: once a painting has any success the gallery will insist that 
        you continue in that vein. “That unlucky day,” Morton Feldman called it. 
        On the one hand this seems a terrible limitation, on the other, it can 
        function as a stimulus like any constraint. And of course it’s not possible 
        to sort out the market pressure from all the other factors. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I don’t know. I’ve always assumed that Rothko 
        became very meditative about his work, that he chose this level of exploration 
        for himself. But of course, it’s undeniable that what he chooses to explore 
        at that moment fits very neatly into developing colorist, minimalist movements.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: As we said in the preface to our first anthology, 
        <i>A Century in Two Decades</i>, “It is not denying the importance of 
        ‘movements,’ to insist that there is another importance in moving beside 
        or apart from them.” I may be naive, but I think it is <i>poems</i> that 
        make a difference rather than marketing strategies.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Getting back to Bataille, is it useful to think 
        that any genre has, at any given point in its history, excess energy, 
        energy that hasn’t been used up. Or do some forms become obsolete?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Steve Evans’s <i>The Dynamics of Literary Change 
        </i>goes into this very instructively, in discussing Bourdieu’s <i>The 
        Field of Cultural Production</i>. He sets up a dynamic where the “field” 
        absorbs any number of new “position-takings” until there is a flood of 
        them, which forces redefinition of the field. But there is a third possibility: 
        that the “new” reawakens the genre’s unused, dormant potential, that it 
        “draws out of retirement, as it were, a position that already exists somewhere 
        in the history of the field.” The sonnet-form seems to have such dormant 
        energy that has blossomed recently with Ted Berrigan and Bernadette Mayer. 
        And the novel seems to hang on, even though its death has been proclaimed 
        any number of times.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And yet the novel seems to have developed its 
        most characteristic logics — climactic narrative structure, omniscient 
        author, single point perspective, internally consistent characters, etc. 
        — during that late 18th and full-blown 19th century (extending now into 
        the 21<sup>st</sup> century) period when such constructs were taken to 
        be the unfolding of natural reason. One could, with a certain tunnel vision, 
        find it quite odd that it persists, except perhaps as an aid to nostalgia. 
        Or one might see the current of its energy coming now out of the collision 
        with these very different times, different needs, different senses of 
        ourselves, different clusters contained by possessive pronouns like “our,” 
        different views of the observer and the observed. So, does the excess 
        energy come out of the friction created by these differences? It seems 
        to me to be a kind of “poethical” necessity that there be explorations 
        of the form of the novel that take into account these new sources of energy, 
        and confusion! These are messy things we can’t grasp and package in neat 
        pre-ordained forms without betraying something about how we are experiencing 
        them in the world. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But you keep coming back to a very narrow definition 
        of the novel. The novel is also the least neat, least defined, most elastic 
        genre. By the 1920s, E. M. Forster can’t find anything more precise to 
        say about it than: a narrative of a certain length! If you define it this 
        way it’s impossible to kill off! This is why we can still call “novels” 
        those narratives that don’t fit the Balzac-Flaubert-Dostojewski-Tolstoi 
        model you talk about, but rather fit with your category of the “exploded 
        novel” — or with <i>Tristram Shandy.</i> I recently read two wonderful 
        such “novels.” One is <i>The Christ of Fish</i> by Joel Hoffmann, an Israeli 
        writer. Its structure could be labeled lyrical atomism: extremely short 
        chapters, some only 4 or 5 lines. The narrative line likewise atomized 
        into a mosaic of vignettes. Very little happening. But there are characters. 
        One has a heart “filled with great Hungarian sorrow.” The language is 
        wonderful, full of imaginative leaps that fuse the cosmic and the comic: 
        “Though the Earth was revolving on its axis, the apple strudel was not 
        overturned.” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The other is a German work, W. G. Sebald’s <i>Rings 
        of Saturn.</i> It is the narrative of a depression which the narrator 
        tries to overcome by going on a walking tour through part of England. 
        It fuses narrative, research into the history of the area he walks through, 
        comments on books, people, mini-essays, quotations both textual and pictorial. 
        In fact, his use of pictures, many of them, is his most obvious way of 
        breaking up the narrative. They are not illustrations, but reference points 
        placed at precise points of the text, sometimes integrated into a sentence. 
        They at first seem to constitute a reality check, a more objective record 
        than writing can be. But this proves deceptive. In the end, they exacerbate 
        the feeling of inability to hold on to “reality.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But back to your Realist novel and how it must struggle 
        and change with changed circumstance. Your comment makes sense of the 
        novel’s history after 1900: that the omniscient narrator was the first 
        to disappear, along with God; that we got limited, “unreliable,” and later 
        fragmented, multiple, viewpoints.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> there 
        are sort of cameo appearances of the omniscient narrator. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Actually, no. The narrator <i>plays</i> at being 
        omniscient with explicit warnings: “This is conjecture. I <i>am </i>making 
        this up, and as long as I’m making it up I might as well pretend to know 
        what this character thinks!” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Announcing it as a device.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Years ago, I went to a reading by the novelist 
        Toby Olson. He said afterwards, in the course of discussion, that he felt 
        all the self-consciousness about the constructs of genre was really a 
        waste of time. That these things have always been artifice. The novelist 
        should just go about the business of writing the novel, enjoying the privileges 
        of that artifice.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That it’s all artifice is true enough. I mean, 
        none of the novelists thought they were just mirroring life.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: You think not! Really? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I know Stendhal <i>claimed</i> that he was just 
        parading a mirror along the highway. But surely he didn’t <i>believe</i> 
        it. How could any writer <i>believe</i> this! Toby Olson is right about 
        the artifice, but the conclusion he draws seems odd — as if there were 
        only one kind of artifice. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: This raises two kinds of issues. One has to do 
        with the way in which certain artificial forms become “naturalized” in 
        the minds of those who use them — both as practitioner and audience. So 
        there can actually be a complete lapse of the memory of the artifice <i>as</i> 
        artifice. Don’t you think there is a sizable portion of the public that 
        believes responsible art, like science, does in fact — or <i>should</i>, 
        if it doesn’t — mirror nature? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Readers, “the public,” granted. But an artist 
        cannot help knowing it is artifice. Well, no, come to think, there are 
        probably lots of artists who have internalized, “naturalized,” as you 
        — and Forrest-Thomson — say, the artifice to the point of not being aware 
        of it. So many movements have been founded in the name of “nature.” But 
        then, when we say “nature” we have actually shifted ground, away from 
        “reality.” At least since Tasso, since Shakespeare’s time, Aristotle’s 
        mimesis has been interpreted as an imitation of <i>natura naturans, </i>nature 
        in its creative processes, not in its products, <i>natura naturata.</i> 
        But I must also admit that, unlike you, I enjoy some “realistic” narratives 
        if the writing is not too transparent. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Mavis Gallant, 
        William Trevor. Why couldn’t we “take it all”?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, good question! Though people seem to have 
        a lot of difficulty moving about between disparate modes and forms. This 
        may have something to do with the uses of art — whether it’s used primarily 
        for relaxation-relief-escape-entertainment or for awakening senses and 
        intellect in relation to, say, history or to one’s contemporary situation 
        in the world....It sounds like you don’t have trouble finding uses for 
        (or better yet, pleasure!) in, many different kinds of forms. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Actually, this is not true in poetry, in my “field.” 
        There, my reading is much narrower. There are not too many current “mainstream” 
        poems that I enjoy. And even those, early Merwin for instance, I don’t 
        go back to very often. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What about in your publishing? Do you think of 
        Burning Deck as promoting a particular kind of poetry?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, our bias is for the “innovative,” the “explorative.” 
        Though we try to keep an open mind. The books I have been most excited 
        about are books like Mei-mei Berssenbrugge’s <i>Heat Bird</i>, Tina Darragh’s 
        <i>Striking Resemblance,</i> Barbara Guest’s <i>The Countess from Minneapolis</i>, 
        or Pam Rehm’s <i>The Garment In Which No One Had Slept.</i>&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: If you think in terms of “stages of a person’s 
        intellectual development” then you can argue that having gotten to a new 
        stage you must, ipso facto, have thrown off the yoke of the previous one. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But if you look a little later, you realize that 
        what you have rejected has nevertheless had its effect on you. The lines 
        are never as clean as they are in the manifestos. That’s of course why 
        we value them: they simplify and thus allow you to get a handle on a trend, 
        movement, direction. But the works are never as simple. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: True, the works are trying to do new things in 
        conditions that still contain the impulses of past forms. But another 
        way to think of this is in terms of anxieties. If you think about criticisms 
        of the 19th century novel — and its attendant prose style — as a seamless, 
        airless panopticon it would very rapidly seem that all conventional prose 
        lacks oxygen. While you, on the other hand, move toward prose for <i>more</i> 
        air! This may seem, or actually be, a real contradiction in the world 
        of innovative writing. But supposing the description of conventional prose 
        as hermetic is actually a self-description on the part of the reader, 
        a description of the anxiety she feels when she finds herself being sucked 
        into a skillfully constructed, logically possible world whose grounding 
        is the erasure of the collisions and swerves and improbabilities of complex 
        real life. Of course, as you may guess, I entirely identify with this 
        since my addicted use of the novel as a teenager was precisely to flee 
        a world that I didn’t want to face or be part of. And retrospectively 
        feeling that all this novel reading was most definitely <i>not</i> a preparation 
        for real life!</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, but it was an alternative to daydreaming 
        and more <i>vital, </i>being vicarious experience. You <i>needed</i> to 
        do exactly that. Just as we need to dream. Nobody could stand conscious 
        life 24 hours a day!</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: That’s true. It’s not that I would wind back 
        the reel and say, “You may not read those novels!” </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It was also an experience of form — even if that 
        form now stifles you. At this point in my life I read at a sort of micro 
        level, I read for the language, the style, the texture.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And not the story at all?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well, how can one disentangle them? But I get 
        very impatient with any writing that doesn’t have good sentences. Several 
        friends had recommended <i>The Golden Notebook</i> by — what’s her name 
        —</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Doris Lessing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Such scope! they said. But the sentences were 
        atrociously dull — I couldn’t read it and never got to that great scope! 
        Whereas when I open a book and the first sentence is: “When I heard that 
        Isaac Kornfeld, a man of piety and brains, had hanged himself in the public 
        park, I put a token in the subway stile and journeyed out to see the tree,” 
        I’ll definitely read on. This is Cynthia Ozick’s “Pagan Rabbi.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, when as a teenager I read Thomas Mann — 
        in translation — I loved the prose, I loved the story, the “vision,” the 
        intellectual Romanticism. I don’t think I could read it now. In fact I’m 
        grateful for whatever led me to read it then; otherwise I would have missed 
        it entirely. I’m too suspicious of that intellectual Romanticism now.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: What is it that you read for now? What keeps 
        you interested?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I don’t read novels at all any more. Yours, and 
        just a few others — mostly by poets — have been an exception just because 
        they <i>are</i> an exception to those elements that stifle me. I like 
        stylistic strategies that undermine the authority of the writer while 
        clearly partaking of her intelligence. What I do love is the complex interplay 
        of fragmentary glimpses — a polylectic, polylogical play — all of which 
        does have a cumulative effect larger than the sum of the parts, but always 
        an unexpected one. And, because of the fragmentation — the invitation 
        to the reader to participate in making sense of things — and the complexity, 
        each reading is a new reading in some truly significant sense. I find 
        this mostly in poetry, since poetry can include everything these days, 
        even prose — but prose fragments. Otherwise, for the security of predictable, 
        but interesting sentences that are reassuring — I admit I want that too 
        — things I can take to bed at night, I read biographies and autobiographies, 
        essays, Buddhist texts, newspapers, French magazines...Though, having 
        said all that, when I read <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> I was 
        interested in the story, but only because that story is wrenched out of 
        the conventions of the well-crafted novel and placed within a delightfully, 
        humorously rigged scaffold. There is an evocation of a very specific culture 
        and historical period in your book that entirely resists being cast into 
        the kind of grandiose metanarrative that one finds in Thomas Mann. I recoil 
        from such things now, in a way I certainly didn’t as a teenager — then, 
        the more grandiose the better! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But the fun with Mann is that he always undermines 
        his “grandiosity,” even in his style. Always overdoing it to the point 
        of absurdity. Never one adjective, always at least three! &nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What would be a recent example of a novel that 
        you’ve enjoyed? </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Mostly I reach for authors like Clarice Lispector, 
        the Brazilian novelist. Do you know her?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I do — <i>The Foreign Legion, The Hour of the 
        Star</i>...They’ve been highly recommended. In fact I picked up remaindered 
        copies, but I confess I haven’t been able to read them. What do you like 
        in her work? She’s writing about another world too —</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: She spans quite a bit of territory. Some of her 
        stories are really extensions of modernist stories, extensions of what 
        could almost be a Thomas Mann story, except for going more into microstructures. 
        The longer works can be fairly abstract, like <i>Aqua Viva</i>, a meditation 
        on the creative process. But maybe the most extreme work is <i>The Passion 
        According to G.H.</i> in which all that “happens” is that a woman kills 
        a cockroach.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Ah, after “The Metamorphosis”! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: And has a mystical experience! A total vision 
        of life, death, everything. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Does the murder take place on the first page, 
        followed by the unfolding vision?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: No, the two are completely integrated. Actually 
        there’s also a drawing on the wall. A “dirty” drawing, of stick figures 
        having sexual intercourse, which provides the frame. But disgust with 
        the cockroach, killing the cockroach and then contemplating the little 
        bit of white cockroach viscosity seeping out takes up the whole (very 
        short) novel. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So then the language has to be everything.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That’s it. The language and getting at the functioning 
        of the mind, the thought process.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you have the book here? Could you pull it 
        out, to find an example of that texture?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I have it only in a French translation. We first 
        discovered Lispector in French. But it has been translated into English 
        also. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m still looking for an example of the actual 
        language that you’re finding of interest and exciting in those terms — 
        of texture. Without an example, it’s hard to have a feeling for it.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: But actually a short example wouldn’t quite do 
        it, because the astonishing thing is that she can keep it going up to 
        novel length, and it keeps being fascinating. The structure is interesting 
        too — it’s in very short chapters, about two pages long, and the last 
        sentence is always the first sentence of the next chapter. It’s as if 
        taking a breath and then continuing from where you left off. It makes 
        for a very nice rhythm.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: That’s also the form of a “crown” of sonnets. 
        Was she a poet as well?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I don’t think so. Of course I only know what’s 
        been translated. But nearly every novelist has a poetry skeleton in the 
        closet. &nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I thought it would be interesting for you to 
        think aloud about the relationship between fact and fiction in your work 
        — the inventing that is fiction, that etymologically seems to have something 
        to do with “touching” — touching perhaps things that don’t become audible, 
        visible in the constructs we call “factual.” Though there is a different 
        use of “fact” — those that give the invented fiction a sort of documentary 
        aspect, an historical context, say. I ask this particularly with respect 
        to <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> because what I experience as 
        a ratio of “need to relate” to “need to invent” is so charged with constructive 
        energy there.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: There is a lot going on in your phrase of “touching 
        things that don’t become audible, visible in the constructs we call factual.” 
        It’s a good answer to the “mirroring” claim we talked about. It also reminds 
        me of Adorno’s — let me find the quote: “Art does not recognize reality 
        by reproducing it photographically, but by voicing that which is veiled 
        by the empirical forms of reality.” I prefer your active fingers to his 
        more clichéd unveiling. The “touching” in the etymology of fiction seems 
        to be touching clay, hence forming, shaping. So to continue your image, 
        it would be by shaping, molding the clay of “fact,” that fiction can make 
        perceptible things not perceptible otherwise. This means treating as “clay” 
        what is already a construct, i.e. first of all destroying it (to avoid 
        the word “deconstruct!”). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And that is, I suspect, where the energy comes from. 
        The need to tell is rather a need to destroy, and the need to invent, 
        a need to reconstruct, differently.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the <i>Hanky</i>, some things are presented as 
        fact and others as speculation. But that is a fictional distinction. Actually, 
        I was thinking back to the “realistic” novel. It also treats “fact” as 
        clay. Realism is a technique like any other. It foregrounds other things 
        than a collage technique does, say, or the studies in “voice,” Coover 
        and Hawkes, for instance. But “reality” in any case — it’s one of those 
        big, vague words I’m uncomfortable with, as you must be also. I mean, 
        what <i>is</i> fact?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: We might discuss your wonderful headings in <i>The 
        Reproduction of Profiles</i>: Facts, Thinkable Pictures, Feverish Propositions, 
        If Words Are Signs, Successive Applications. This seems to me a perfectly 
        complete uncertain epistemological universe! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well, there you have it. With some thanks to 
        Wittgenstein.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Then, to evade that question, I suppose it would 
        be interesting to try to trace the genesis of the impulse to tell a story. 
        A story that comes out of your life experience — a good deal of it lived 
        outside of books. A good deal in. But your family experience, say, forming 
        part of that drive to tell a story, to <i>make</i> a story. Actually, 
        when you talk about “telling” a story it’s as if — </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It existed already. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, so to “make” a story of it. And memories 
        become part of the material with which you work, as well as information 
        of various kinds — about music, about meteorology, scientific measurement, 
        historical events...A sub-universe of knowledge and imaginative transformation. 
        Making a kind of mosaic picture from bits and fragments. One might ask, 
        Why do this?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Memory is problematic, as uncertain as I claim 
        in the book. I was telling somebody about the wonderfully sinister ending 
        of Hitchcock’s <i>The Birds </i>— when the couple gets back to San Francisco, 
        there’s the Golden Gate Bridge with <i>birds</i> all over it. Keith looked 
        at me, “This is not the way it ends; it is how Hitchcock <i>wanted</i> 
        to end it. You have <i>read </i>this.” I was stunned. I had such a vivid 
        visual image of it in my mind! Now, this has become a joke between us. 
        If I remember something <i>very clearly</i>, it’s certainly false. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Do you think there’s some kind of pattern, in 
        a story for instance, that you may feel a need to construct because of 
        personal experience? Is there some sort of pattern, if not specific detail, 
        that has to remain intact for the charge to be there, or perhaps some 
        sort of pattern that has to change? I think again of that wonderful sentence 
        on the cover of <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter </i>— “The drive to 
        know our own story moves us to see through it and touch the violence inherent 
        in the mechanism itself.” Is there some sort of boundary pattern that 
        must be there precisely in order to not betray the violence of “the mechanism 
        itself” — whatever that might be? You’ve said that for eight years you 
        were trying to figure out a way — </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: You’re not letting me off with a joke! OK. I’m 
        serious that the impulse to tell comes out of the impulse to destroy, 
        to change — even if it is with the idea of coming to know, of gaining 
        clarity through the process of formulating. But memory does this anyway. 
        My computer has a glitch. If I use the “insert date” function and 2 weeks 
        later want to check when I wrote the letter: the moment I open the file, 
        the date changes to the <i>current</i> date. Memory is like this. Every 
        time we “access” a memory we alter it, re-construct it, so that it becomes 
        more and more fictional as time goes on. The fact of observation changes 
        the data observed. This is the “violence inherent in the mechanism,” be 
        it remembering, thinking about, observing, analyzing. In writing <i>The 
        Hanky,</i> the important moment was when I began to foreground this doubt, 
        when I found this form that dips in and out, goes into “story,” then draws 
        back to the narrator’s uncertainties, then takes another dip. Once I got 
        that rhythm, things started to happen, the fragments started coming together. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: So the rhythm was one of launching out to write 
        about characters and interactions between characters and then — </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: drawing back into doubts, self-consciousness. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: What roles did the musical and meteorological 
        metaphors play in this rhythm?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Music was part of the material, an important 
        thing in the family. Which is why I made the narrator a musician. A friend 
        of mine said, “How German of you. You present music as if it could explain 
        anything! What a German idea!”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, music is the Art of the Soul! in German 
        tradition, isn’t it? The picture I have from all my early years (my wasted 
        adolescence again!) of going to concerts, hearing mainly German music 
        — Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert — was that the hall was filled 
        with people (myself included) who felt the music was filling them with 
        great ideas, with a grand and immense <i>felt</i> knowledge. Now I see 
        that we didn’t learn anything at all — except about the patterns of the 
        music itself, that we didn’t walk out any the wiser for having those vibrations 
        strike our eardrums. We had felt a lot, but...it reminds me of Wittgenstein’s 
        question, “How would you respond if someone said, I think it merely strikes 
        you that you know that?” I remember reading a wonderful description of 
        this. The picture was of the “souls” of the concert audience being steadily 
        inflated by the music, hanging over them like enormous hot air balloons. 
        The concert ends and you try not to hear the sssssssssssssssssssssss! 
        I think of it as a very particular repetition compulsion — the continual 
        climb to climaxes — audible alpinisms — particularly in the Romantic period.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: That sounds like Musil, possibly. It is curious 
        how immediate music seems although it is time-based arts, just like language 
        arts. With a poem you must at least read all the way through to the end. 
        You may even need more time to reflect, to hold it for a while. Of course 
        in music, too, it takes a while to get the form, but there’s an immediate 
        “attack” on the emotions, even before it gets to the alpinism! What a 
        great phrase! Of course, what we just listened to, the Cage piece, gets 
        away from that. In the novel, I use both the meteorology and the music 
        in terms of emotional atmosphere. I suppose I give the technical details 
        sometimes to make it funny, but mostly to undercut just that effect of 
        “creating atmosphere” — </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, yes — and it’s the terrifying continuity 
        and consistency of that atmosphere that again renders me short of breath.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, so instead I look at the technical details 
        that <i>make up</i> atmosphere. There’s more about how the hammers in 
        the piano work than about music. As I enumerate, in <i>A Form</i>, how 
        the muscles in Montezuma’s arm work — going to the mechanism behind the 
        phenomenon. Still intending the emotions, of course. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And then there’s Josef [in <i>Hanky</i>] who 
        is himself so preoccupied with atmospherics and measurements. The recurrent 
        gesture for him is tapping his finger on the barometer. So is this the 
        play within the play of the narrative metaphor? Josef, the character, 
        is doing with his life what Waldrop, the writer is doing with the novel? 
        You are also tapping your fingers on various mechanisms. I find this interesting 
        as an intersection of the form of life of the character, genre, and writer. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, yes, exactly. He can never figure out his 
        wife — her emotional barometer! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: As you can’t really figure out your characters, 
        or this particular knotty history. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m reminded of Russians I’ve known who talk 
        about how they’re feeling in terms of the barometer. In fact, they seem 
        to think constantly about barometric pressure while monitoring daily fluctuations 
        in their health. Americans don’t think that way. Do Germans do that?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. The air pressure is thought to have a very 
        direct influence. Well, in Munich there is a particular wind, the “Fšhn,” 
        which gives enormous headaches to many people, including me. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Similar to the Mistral? I’ve heard it referred 
        to as a source of headaches and insanity. Perhaps because of the relentlessness 
        of it, keeping people constantly on edge.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Music is of course part of the cultural atmosphere. 
        It can give us different kinds of headaches.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, sound surrounds us. We move in it as we 
        do in weather. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There are some very specific details about performance 
        of particular pieces in <i>Hanky</i>. Are those details functioning metaphorically?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: If I’m thinking of the same passages, e.g. about 
        formal control versus “letting go,” yes. Metaphors for problems of writing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: There’s a moment in<i> Hanky </i>— on page 25 
        — when Josef walks over to the barometer and the needle is pointing to 
        “steady.” It seems clear at that point that this is an indicator of — 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: the relationship, yes. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: It seemed to me the “pathetic fallacy” once removed, 
        mediated by an instrument. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Exactly! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>A Form/ of Taking/ It All</i> you write 
        about the need to make our own connections: “The importance of connecting 
        it all into a cosmos which opens out like the splendid white flower from 
        the red disk of that fall-blooming annual. Metaphor, she mumbles. Half 
        my life I’ve spent connecting perceptions this way, by analogy. But the 
        flower I’d have skipped. Only a scientist can afford such hackneyed comparisons. 
        She accepts, though, that without our connecting them into a picture the 
        dots are not even visible, that being real means having form. Metaphor, 
        muscles, telescopes, travelers.” (17)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Uh huh! I think I would stand by that. It’s only 
        in relation that anything makes any sense. We talked about Olson’s: what 
        matters is not things, but what happens <i>between</i> them. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I think the interesting question for me as a 
        reader, and as a writer, is how much needs to be connected <i>in</i> the 
        writing? To what degree can those dots describe many possible relationships, 
        a kind of choreography where the constantly <i>changing</i> relational 
        tension between them is the source of the energy? Where it’s not only 
        that there need not be fixed lines drawn, but that to draw them would 
        be to skewer the butterfly so to speak, to kill it in order to study it, 
        rather than to live with it while observing it’s quirky movements in nature, 
        accepting that it might get away.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: OK, I’m with you that the connection had better 
        not be too explicit. But one still has to create a <i>tension</i> between 
        the dots which they might not have on their own. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: I’m not sure there’s really tension in connection 
        — the connection that’s already been made. Tension seems to me to come 
        from the moving parts, the uncertainties in relational principles like 
        juxtaposition.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: True, but juxtaposition <i>is</i> a connection.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Well, I’m not so sure about that. Maybe there 
        is a significant difference between connection and relationship. I think 
        a really vital relationship is entirely a matter of context and, if the 
        context is rich enough, there is a constant transforming dialectic in 
        process between particular and particular, context and particular elements, 
        etc. and I really think this is of a different order from connection which 
        — to my mind — has to do with stopping the motion, fixing things in place, 
        tying them together, pinning them down.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Well if you’re defining connection in this way...I 
        was rather talking about syntax in the large sense, the way which elements 
        are placed next to which others on the page. (Which does not exhaust the 
        ways they will rearrange themselves in the mind of the reader.) Not anything 
        juxtaposed with anything will automatically have tension. Some juxtapositions 
        are inert, don’t have the potential to spark. And there is the additional 
        problem that two juxtaposed items might be inert for me, but might have 
        enormous tension for you — the same two things.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes. And that’s entirely relational, isn’t it? 
        The relation to the associational contexts I or you bring along as readers 
        or writers. But also, because this comes down to the form of attention, 
        of noticing, that we bring to a text, there is the issue of the way in 
        which that text itself educates, or even “initiates” the reader’s attention 
        so that s/he can notice a range of things unimaginable before the act 
        of reading began. Perhaps this is best done Venn diagram style — areas 
        that overlap just a bit, or barely graze one another, but that do actually 
        touch if only tangentially...These stretch our observational field and 
        then, having warmed up our metaphorical muscles we are capable of reaching 
        for relations that didn’t overlap prior to our coming in as participant 
        observer, collaborator. With this new geometry of attention, we begin 
        to find ourselves making connections, noting tensions that the author 
        may not have had in mind at all. As we do, after all, all the time in 
        “real-life” space, time and chaos, yes/no?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Theoretically. Though in “real life” we can’t 
        muster that kind of attention all the time — it would create an overload 
        and we would — well — explode. Indifference may be a necessary defense.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: But isn’t that why art <i>is in fact</i> different 
        from everyday life? — that in the artifice of an abbreviated space-time 
        frame we can afford to risk a heightened attention that might be quite 
        awkward as a daily constant? Of course the encounter with a text is also 
        the encounter with an “other” mind, a mind — thank god — not our own, 
        another culture, ethos, form of life...and that means, to the extent that 
        what has been written is not formulaic or imitatively generic or safely 
        conventional, there will always be a need for initiation. I think readers 
        forget this. The idea of instant accessibility overlooks what every high 
        school teacher used to say about one’s first attempt at a Russian novel: 
        “The first chapter will be very hard, but if you persist it will teach 
        you how to read the rest of the book.” This is true of all literature 
        removed from one’s immediate experience. The first few minutes of a Shakespearean 
        play are hard, then you get “used to” the language. That the same holds 
        true for contemporary experimental literature might be a useful revelation. 
        In reading <i>A Form/ of Taking /It All </i>your obsessions and preoccupations 
        — which were definitely not all mine at the outset — the things that led 
        you to make the connections and juxtapositions and relationships that 
        you constructed, initiated <i>me</i> as a reader into the new world of 
        your text, <i>it’s</i> gravitational and electromagnetic and strong and 
        weak nuclear forces as well as incidents having to do with the New World 
        of the Americas, the new worlds of science, etc. that the text is “about.” 
        Pretty soon the reader is skipping along discovering and making connections 
        with ecstatic delight! What this means is that the process of reading 
        had so refocused, reoriented my thinking that by the time I got to page 
        50 — where you are simply juxtaposing, supplying fewer connections between 
        things — I was entirely ready to play. In this new constellation.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Great! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: In <i>The Hanky</i> on page 119 you write, “Outside 
        the story all the sentences are possible, whereas inside, a ‘then’ brings 
        out unexpected threads and lines of force. But there are obvious holes 
        where all that escapes the story looks on. These holes eventually show 
        through. More and more, here, unnerving me. The words land, without warning, 
        among cries and Siegheils.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes, at the beginning, there are infinite possibilities. 
        But as soon as you put down one element you start limiting the options. 
        A “then” implies a temporal sequence, maybe even a causal one, which is 
        what the novel supposedly works with. But the holes are actually more 
        important. The holes, all that escapes the story, the unrealized potential 
        of the narrative. They acknowledge the limits of the artifice and pit 
        it against the stronger presence , here, of history. Even when not talked 
        about, history is present, looks on. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: And the form with the holes allows it to look 
        on, allows that permeability to what cannot be contained in the story.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Yes. This gets us back to your favorite bugbear, 
        the closed universe of the traditional novel. The holes are extremely 
        important.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Seeking the closed novel is in a sense seeking 
        to be protected from history.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Right.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, this brings to mind another passage in <i>The 
        Hanky, </i>captioned “HOLD ON, ANDREA, I HAVE MORE DOCUMENTS.” Then goes 
        on, “A registered letter from <i>Kreisleiter </i>Müller. A summons, rather. 
        Copies of letters Josef wrote. A scene with Müller I remember by my terror 
        though, at the time, I didn’t know what it was about. And there is my 
        Latin teacher, Professor Acker, who was arrested by the Nazis. Little 
        islands. If I join them all it makes a plot. But should they be joined? 
        The real story is the water washing around them.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Another image in the same direction.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: “And can I get any closer to it if I make myself 
        immobile, without ideas or point of view? So that I disappear into that 
        element of the story which is me: Lucy Seifert, the third daughter. Still 
        unborn at this point”(128).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I guess I was quite preoccupied with definitions 
        of the novel — the attempt at objectivity wasn't working, but present 
        as something to be played against.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: We were talking about gestures yesterday — their 
        abbreviation lightens the baggage of the conventional novel. And this 
        lightness of form that you bring, instead of the heavily panting plot, 
        makes me think now of the recurrent image of the hanky floating in air. 
        It comes about eleven times in the course of the book, an interesting 
        anti-gravitational display — Pippin's daughter waving it, or it’s floating 
        on its own, occasionally landing. What is that about? Of course it begins 
        in the title; it is <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I thought of the hanky story as an example of 
        the violent reduction, the foreshortening that we do in fiction, in history, 
        in our daily lives. Our way of constructing a manageable reality out of 
        the overwhelming welter of details. Form = radical exclusion. The whole 
        life of King Pippin’s daughter gets reduced to the one gesture of losing 
        a handkerchief — and that preserved only in a local legend about the founding 
        of a town that does not even bear her name, but that of shepherd Kitz 
        who found the hanky!</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Hmm. Interesting. You yourself are writing as 
        a daughter. So are you waving this book lightly, dropping it as your floating 
        gesture?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Hoping that somebody will pick it up! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: How early did you know this story?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: It seems I’ve always known “how the town of Kitzingen 
        got it’s name.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: As a child did you wonder about her, about the 
        daughter herself?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: I know I wondered why it is the shepherd’s name 
        rather than the daughter’s name. But then he <i>found</i> the hanky; she 
        just <i>lost </i>it! The utilitarian spirit! </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Hmm. Interesting, the woman’s loss — the gossamer 
        hanky — marks the spot for the man to plant the flag — hanky secured to 
        a pole — and say “I name this Kitzingen!” Or, thinking about <i>A Key 
        Into the Language of America,</i> it’s the diminished — feminized? — natives 
        — </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: Losing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">JR: Yes, their loss enables the taking possession, 
        the re-naming. One could wonder about this, this disappearance of the 
        feminine element as precondition for certain kinds of possessive violence 
        — the consecration of the Fatherland.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">RW: This sounds good, but in the specific case of 
        my Kitzingen legend, this male-female hierarchy is complicated by the 
        social hierarchy which goes in the opposite direction: a noblewoman and 
        a shepherd. </p>
