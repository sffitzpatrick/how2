      <p class="TITLE2" align="left"> <em>American Women Poets in the 21st Centuy: 
        Where Lyric Meets Language<br>
        </em>eds. Claudia Rankine and Juliana Spahr<br>
        Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 2002<br>
        Paper (ISBN 0-8195-6547-4), 439 pages</p>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I like this volume.  It has my head whirring. Because 
        I am reading this volume, I am busily rethinking my “Experimental Women’s 
        Writing” seminar for fall.  Because I am reading this volume, I am reconsidering 
        the efficacy of other “poetry anthologies” (including my own co-edited 
        one) that lack the structural hybrid that <i>American Women Poets in the 
        21<sup>st</sup> Century</i> quite uniquely presents.   Because I am reading 
        this volume, I am reconsidering the efficacy, and the sheer beauty, of 
        lyric in the charge of women.  For the women represented in this anthology 
        are well versed in the lyric’s problems for women (pun intented).  They 
        are women bold enough to write lyric anyway.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even if Theodor Adorno was right, that “to write 
        poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” As co-editor Juliana Spahr notes 
        in her comprehensive introduction, Adorno’s phrase recently has come under 
        feminist challenge.  This volume lets us re-imagine the sense of the “barbaric.”  
        If the “barbaric” becomes a nominal signifier referencing an otherwise 
        indescribable space only superciliously tagged “the confessional,” so, 
        too, the lyric becomes an indescribable space that poets featured here 
        can inhabit.  The American women poets selected by Spahr and co-editor 
        Claudia Rankine seem all too aware of Adorno’s conclusion. A dialogue 
        between issues of “lyric, gender, and innovation,” Spahr promises us a 
        deeper exploration of the politically incorrect lyric, through snippets 
        of these poets’ work, along with their artist’s statements and excellent 
        critical analyses.  All the poets here — Spahr especially cites Lucy Brock-Broido, 
        Brenda Hillman, Jorie Graham, and Ann Lauterbach — seem to be rearticulating 
        the lyric’s “impossibility and difficulty,” working to construct a new 
        formation of lyrical’s “interiority,” as site of resistance.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perceiving “modernist innovation” as “a feminist 
        space,” after foremothers in the innovative field, Kathleen Fraser and 
        Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Spahr is careful to distinguish between a “poetry 
        of uplift” that might attempt to provide “positive images of revised femininity.”  
        These poets rather call for an investigation of “representation itself” 
        through the lyric, suggesting “alternatives to lyrics troubled and limited 
        history for women” (3).  The artists’ statements — what the volume editors 
        call “poetic statements” — help articulate that investigation, on all 
        its fronts.  The inclusion of these artists’ statements alone makes this 
        volume an invaluable resource, as well as an excellent textbook for any 
        advanced women’s writing or contemporary American poetry class.  Many 
        of the artists’ statements are reprinted from small-press poetry journals 
        like <i>Fence</i>.  But some are explicitly written for this volume, such 
        as Mei-mei Berssenbrugge’s “Preparatory Notes” and “By Correspondence,” 
        combining both self-reflective statements about the writing process along 
        with a series of “Letters” addressed to critic Linda Voris, which answer 
        central concerns about Berssenbrugge’s life and work. Anyone who loves 
        Berssenbrugge’s work will find her statement fascinating.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And I particularly admire Rae Armantrout’s statement, 
        the essay “Cheshire Poetics,” which with Armantrout’s usual elliptical 
        and humorous clarity constructs the metaphor of an appearing and disappearing 
        “Cheshire” to call forth what she suggests is “the double bind” of meaning 
        in her poetry: the problem of “what is seen and what is seeing, what can 
        be known and what it is to know.”  Like Ron Silliman, who has written 
        provocatively of his good friend Armantrout’s use of ellipses to create 
        an empirical-epistemological problematic of meaning, Armantrout proudly 
        places herself within a spatialized and sonic reference system in which 
        writing becomes not a means of saying something purposeful but “a poetics 
        of collisions and overlaps, of contested spaces”;  “Various voices speak 
        in my poems, I code-shift.”  Armantrout declares a loyalty to the “slither” 
        that Ezra Pound pronounced was happily missing in modernist poet HD’s 
        writing — a loyalty I would argue is shared by all the other poets in 
        the volume that follow.  While I don’t think Armantrout quite pegged Pound 
        to the wall — I believe he was critiquing the “slither” of Georgian sentimentality 
        in pre-war popular verse and advocating a “cut direct” method that embraced 
        rather than rejected Armantrout’s “slither” — it is her duality between 
        indirectness and oracular precision that compels the reader of her verse.  
        It is our desire for what Barbara Guest called “Fair Realism” (in her 
        1989 book by that title) vying against the “swerving motion” that typifies 
        referentiality in Armantrout’s poetry (quoting Hank Lazer’s fine essay 
        on the matter).  This effect leaves the reader longing for more, for more 
        “slither,” for more “contested spaces.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The inclusion of poets like Lucie Brock-Broido, Jorie 
        Graham, and Brenda Hillman, together with Guest, Lauterbach, Lyn Hejinian 
        and Armantrout, sets up the underlying aesthetic question of this volume, 
        once so beautifully articulated by Armantrout herself: What is the meaning 
        of clarity? And, again, borrowing from Armantrout: what does clarity <i>mean</i>, 
        to <i>whom</i>?  The notion of clarity, and the schools of lyric poetry 
        fighting for and against that expression, create a provocative subtext 
        in the knot of the weave of these distinctive female voices.  Brock-Broido’s 
        poem, “Periodic Table of Ethereal Elements,” seems among the more conventional 
        lines of lyric represented here, in sturdy stanzas such as:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p style="text-align:justify">I was not ready for your form to be cold.<br>
          Ever. Even in life</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">You did not inhabit, necessarily, a form,<br>
          But a mind of</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Rarer liquid element...  (96)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And yet Brock-Broido breaks the mold of the confessional 
        lyric herself in her fractured and ambiguous poem, “Am Moor,” in which 
        sentences seem missing essential components, like subjects or objects, 
        beginning:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p style="text-align:justify">Am lean against.<br>
          Am the heavy hour</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Hand at urge,<br>
          At the verge of one...  (98)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Brock-Broido’s provocative artist’s statement, “Myself 
        a Kangaroo Among the Beauties,” is a series of epigrammatic declarations, 
        which suggest her own lack of lyrical sentimentality when she writes: 
        “I want a poetry which is inorganic, an artifact of artifice, riddled 
        with truth” (100).  Meanwhile, she makes a stern critique of the judgement 
        she feels being not associated with the experimental LANGUAGE school.  
        She writes: “A poem which the world longs to call a language poem is too 
        open for my taste”; and, again, “After I had been the recipient of a particularly 
        thrashing review, Charles Wright, in a letter of solidarity &amp; sympathy, 
        wrote to me regarding LANGUAGE(?) poetry.  He wrote: “What have we been 
        doing all this time anyway, Barking?”  Rejecting the LANGUAGE label, Brock-Broido 
        states, “I aspire to be a New Elliptical.” (101) In his essay on Brock-Broido, 
        Stephen Burt writes of her “Sometimes desperate, often fanciful,” poems, 
        which  “elaborately diverse, allude, and evade.”  These poems, too, “slither.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In fact,<i> American Women Poets in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
        Century</i> helps to reframe the debate about experiment versus tradition 
        in women’s contemporary poetry.  It begs the question: Are you LANGUAGE 
        or not?  I mean it literally <i>begs</i> the question, by refusing to 
        answer it, by refusing to divide the poets into categories that seem exclusionary 
        by design: the outside innovative and the inside conventional, or the 
        inside innovative and the outside conventional — depending on what side 
        one is on. In Sara Lundquist’s wonderful essay on Barbara Guest, “Implacable 
        Poet, Purple Birds,” she describes Guest as bifurcating and blurring boundaries: 
        a poet of some kind of wonderful slither.  She says that Guest “both is 
        and is not a feminist writer…. she both practices and questions ‘experimental 
        poetics’: she both anticipated and surpasses the Language poets.” Such 
        a statement might be made of all the poets represented in this volume.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Instead of the sounds of women arguing, we detect 
        in this volume a more subtle atmosphere, a muted but steady chamber of 
        voices that intersect but never merge, voices that bounce off the various 
        walls of rhetoric others have constructed without colliding. It’s as if 
        there exists in this forum a huge spatial field for all forms of language 
        and imagination and innovation.  If anything, this volume reveals how 
        very distinctive <i>are</i> 21<sup>st</sup> century American women poets.  
        It reveals that women writers are not necessarily tethered to their gender, 
        as Virginia Woolf once suggested of the fictive writer Mary Carmichael 
        in <i>A Room of One’s Own</i>.  But then Mary Carmichael was a novelist, 
        not a lyric writer.  The substrata of intellectual and aesthetic content 
        in this volume makes me think that the multitude of female voices articulating 
        American poetry are not <i>shedding</i> womanhood like a false referential 
        skin; rather they are reworking the physical and cultural synapses of 
        being a woman in the male lyric tradition, through a language and lyrical 
        structure that would divide them and objectify them, like so many fetishized 
        muses.  These voices speak from the “slithery” undefinable world that 
        always characterized “the object.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My criticisms of the volume are negligible.  I might 
        make the criticism that the poets represented here are pretty high-profile.  
        Most are highly published (by such venues as Wesleyan, the volume’s own 
        publisher) and many hold prestigious university positions.  This volume 
        has the effect of recanonizing the nearly canonical in contemporary American 
        poetry.  It takes few risks with its material.  No one really off-beat 
        or marginal gets her say here. The volume might be said to have a proper 
        feel.  Which is not necessarily a defect.  This is an elegant collection 
        that many of us will want to use in our classrooms as well as our research.  
        Overall, I was unusually delighted by the depth of the essays I discovered 
        reading this volume. I did find myself in great disagreement with Craig 
        Dworkin’s assessment of Hejinian’s work as the art of structural “paranoia.” 
        Dworkin clarifies and de-pathologizes his use of the paranoia term, using 
        Naomi Schor’s Freudian explanation to describe a “textual madness.” But 
        I would argue that Hejinian’s writing never constructs “paranoia.”  It 
        is neither “mad” nor a closed system of signs that paranoia represents.  
        Hejinian’s own poetic statement included next to Dworkin’s essay argues 
        for an implicit “host/guest” relationship within poetry, a “xenia,” she 
        writes, which is “the occurrence of an existence which is also an event 
        of strangeness or foreignness.”  It is that experience of “foreignness” 
        that might make such writing seem “mad.”  But like Freud’s uncanny, it 
        is that “foreignness” that resides at home, existing always in an encounter 
        that is cultural life itself.  That life constitutes a continual openness 
        and rearrangement.  And it is this life-as-language that characterizes 
        Hejinian’s work, not the profound sense of isolation structured by the 
        paranoiac.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One of the more successful essays, in my opinion, 
        is Voris’s piece on Berssenbrugge’s unique work. Her detailed analysis 
        of Berssenbrugge’s masterpiece <i>Empathy</i> did much to explain that 
        which always remains mysterious about Berssenbrugge’s lyricism: what Voris 
        calls “a ‘sensitive empiricism’… [disrupting] narrative and the rhetorical 
        representation that simplify experience by insistently tracing the myriad 
        and minute ways in which the phenomenal world enters experience.” (68-69)  
        Berssenbrugge understands “empathy” as those “imaginative acts that create 
        space and with which space is apprehended.” (73) I found this assessment 
        of empathy enormously helpful to my reading of Berssenbrugge’s masterwork, 
        as well as my own thoughts on sympathy and empathy.  Having written on 
        sympathy as a historical construct enveloping the novel, a voyeuristic 
        act requiring a subject’s objectification of the other, I found respite 
        in Voris’ reading of Berssenbrugge’s reading of “empathy”: as a non-linear 
        and non-objectifying set of “formal coordinates, including external and 
        internal boundaries, the sense of limit or of expansiveness…” Many have 
        asked me what is the distinctiveness of empathy from sympathy, and I would 
        turn them to Berssenbrugge (and Voris’ essay) now. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What this volume calls for are more analyses of women’s 
        contemporary poetics, more published artists’ statements, more collections 
        of women’s contemporary innovative writing. We should expand beyond the 
        well-grooved arguments about the lyric, and move the topic of experiment 
        into experimental forms, like the prose poem and intergenre, poems that 
        are no longer clearly “lyric” anymore — for example, the work of Carla 
        Harryman, Bernadette Mayer, and Leslie Scalapino.  This volume gives me 
        thirst — it doesn’t quench.  Which is perhaps the best thing I can say 
        about it.  <i>American Women Poets in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century </i>gives 
        us the desire to desire more contemporary women’s poetry, to read more 
        and beyond what has been already concluded or said.</p>
