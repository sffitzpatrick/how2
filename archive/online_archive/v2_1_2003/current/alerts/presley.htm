      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="left"><em>Noctivagations</em><br>
        Geraldine Monk<br>
        West House Books, 2001, 118pp.</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>Noctivagations</em> brings together most of Geraldine 
        Monk’s writing since <i>Interregnum</i> in 1994 and her selected poems, 
        <i>The Sway of Precious Demons</i> in 1992.  It is important to stress 
        totality of her work, which is sometimes overlooked in reviews, especially 
        as this partiality is often experienced by women writers. <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1"> 
        [1] </A> &nbsp;Moreover, much of Monk’s work has appeared in small press 
        editions, which may be out of print or difficult to obtain. Any reading 
        of <i>Noctivagations</i> should, therefore, be carried out in the context 
        of the earlier writing, of which it is both development and reprise.  
        One example is her playful return to the work of the Spanish artist Goya 
        in <i>La Tormenta</i>, reminding us of one of her most influential early 
        sequences “La quinta del sordo” <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]:</a></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=Section1>We cannot believe<br>
    our very-eyes oh yes our<br>
    very-eyes we cannot believe<br>
    <i>Sopa Goyesca La Quinta<br>
    </i><i>creps del sordo<br>
    </i><i>vegetal in season</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If Goya is the menu, he is also the heart beat of the 
    poem, in the repeated sound of ‘chin’chin’, recalling his name for the bourgeois: 
    ‘chinchilla’.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Another significant aspect of <i>Noctivagations</i> 
          is the promotional blurb on the back: one quote is from an experimental 
          poetry magazine, <i>Object Permanence</i>: “Eerie, violent… an exhilarating 
          flux of human-animal-alien corporealities approximated in language”, 
          and the other is from the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>: “genuine word magic… 
          a wonderful poet: revelatory, intense, ever surprising”.  By choosing 
          these extremely diverse admirers of her work, Monk seems to be making 
          the statement that she wants her work to cast as wide a spell as possible: 
          for it to be enjoyed both by the avant-garde and by a much wider audience.  
          She wants to break out of the marginalisation of the experimental, not 
          into the mainstream of British poetry, who will continue to marginalise 
          her work, but directly to anyone who may hear or read her.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are those in the avant-garde too who will regard 
    this as impossible, or who might declare with Keith Tuma that Monk’s must 
    be ‘expressive’ rather than ‘difficult’ poetry:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> And the first thing to be said about Monk’s poetry is that while 
  it does not use the ‘dominant modes’ of expression, neither is it difficult.  
  Playful, rhetorical, feminist, it can also be as ‘expressive’ as an insult. <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a> 
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet Monk’s poetry is both expressive and difficult, in 
    the sense of experimental and abstract.  It is as expressive as a Goya:</p>
</div>
      <blockquote> Le Goya: un écrasis de rouge, de bleu et de jaune, des virgules 
        de couleur blanche, des pâtés de tons vifs, plaqués, pêle-mêle, mastiqués 
        au couteau… C’est le vacarme le plus effréné qui ait jamais été jeté sur 
        une toile… <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p> </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The debate about women experimental poets and ‘expressive’ 
    modes of writing continues to raise its head.  Clair Wills defined it, in 
    a much-quoted essay, as a false polarisation of formal experimentation and 
    expressive elements, and also of the private and public spheres:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> Thus it is not that ‘expressive’ poetry naively falls back on a stable 
  individuality, and experimental work explores the radical absence of subjectivity.  
  Both are responses to the reconfiguring of the relationship between public and 
  private spheres which makes the ‘private’ lyric impossible, and in effect opens 
  it out towards rhetoric. <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a> </blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She has also analysed how the ‘expressive’ female self 
    is still present in the work of experimental women poets.  It seems to me 
    that a lot of experimental male poetry is intensely expressive, or emotional, 
    but generally within a socialist framework.  As a result male reviewers can 
    appear more comfortable with Monk’s ghettoblaster sequences than with her 
    female self.  The problem with ‘expressiveness’ in female experimental poetry 
    often has more to do with feminism than any form of rhetoric.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">2</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Noctivagations</i> is divided into nine sections: 
    The Transparent Ones; Trilogy; Songings &amp; Strangerlings; Dream Drover; 
    Hidden Cities; Two Dramatics; Fluvium; Three Short Sorties; and Nine Little 
    Ones.  I wrote a brief review of <i>Dream Drover</i> when it was originally 
    published, and which appeared in <i>How2</i>, February 2000.  Of the nine 
    sections, I think that the most interesting development of the experimental 
    and the expressive can be found in ‘The Transparent Ones’ and ‘Two Dramatics’, 
    with its radio drama ‘Manufractured Moon’.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ was originally a performance work 
    called the ‘Metablethers of Getha’.  The change in title is a more accurate 
    description of these texts, as the first version could be applied to all of 
    Monk’s work.  “Metablethers” is a wonderful neologism which also appears in 
    ‘Fluvium’ — some of the most experimental work in <i>Noctivagations</i>.  
    It combines the old English/ Scots word ‘blether’ or blather, meaning to talk 
    loquacious nonsense, with the multi-purpose Greek prefix ‘meta’.  It combines 
    Monk’s use of sound and nonsense poetry with a very rooted use of dialect.   
    She is both in the locale, the dialect, and rising above it, transmuting and 
    experimenting with it.  The name Getha is evidently one of Monk’s pseudonyms, 
    and is used as such in the radio drama ‘Manufractured Moon’.  It begins with 
    the first two letters of her Christian name, but ends in something suggestive 
    of the East, and other spirits.  This is not invalid even if we realise that 
    Getha has a very specific meaning for computer users: Get Hardware Address.  
    One of the developments in Monk’s work has been her use of electronic technology 
    and terminology, for her own subversive purposes.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ are the poems written out of her 
    time as a writer in residence at a hospice for terminally ill people.  If 
    I like it so much, I think it is partly because Monk is often depicted as 
    a wild woman of experimental poetry, whereas these poems show her capacity 
    for a deep attachment to the people she works with, and her essential humanism. 
    Sean Bonney in the Salzberg Review wrote:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> Geraldine Monk is part of a quite easily identified unofficial tendency 
  in contemporary British poetry.  A wild streak… shared with comparable poets 
  like Bill Griffiths and Maggie O’Sullivan. <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> </blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is ‘wild-poetry’, to use Bonney’s phrase, and as 
    indeed the title <i>Noctivagations </i>suggests, but it is also profoundly 
    responsible and responsive poetry.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first poem is “The Gathering”, which begins as if 
    with stage instructions, and the staccato phrasing also used to powerful effect 
    in prose poem sections such as ‘Hidden Cities’ and ‘Three Short Sorties’:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
(High noon.  Mid summer.  Terrace.  Round table.  
    High Peaks in the distance.  Round robin of low sleepless talk.  The Transparent 
    Ones.)
</blockquote>

  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The reference to ‘High Noon’ is a deliberate one, and 
    it is typical of Monk’s work that she introduces filmic, popular culture references.  
    These are both comic and serious.  The struggle with death at the hospice 
    is as intense as any Western gun battle.  It is also one of the ways in which 
    we attempt to talk about death. </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘The Transparent Ones’ raises questions about life and 
    death which are unanswerable, but Monk plays in deadly seriousness with those 
    questions:</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>your natter-flack<br>
    questions creating<br>
    ineffable Q systems &amp;<br>
    split infinities</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Her irreverence towards established religion and Catholicism 
    is probably most clearly reflected by one of her subjects in “Keltic Twilight”, 
    who expresses his “apostasy” in vivid dialect, which Monk captures:  “t-poep-sa-nutter”.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are almost unbearable descriptions and word play 
    on dying flesh, but she never allows the poem to acquire too much solemnity.  
    Nor does she hide the pain of the last agony, and the panic:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
  <p>Skin Panics.<br>
    Even our words are ridd ~ ~ led.<br>
    Sense disappears at every touch.<br>
    (...)</p>
  <p>In the grip of rising panic<br>
    we watch the solitary leaf unfurl ~ ~<br>
    There are moments of relief<br>
    in every fiction</p>
  <p>(The Unspeakable Softness of Flesh)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here punctuation, specifically the tilde, is used to 
    express the breakage or concealment of words and sense, and then becomes visually 
    expressive of new growth.  We have also become familiar, perhaps unconsciously 
    so, with the tilde on our computer screen where it can be shorthand for a 
    hidden extended document title.  Finally there is probably also an echo of 
    the Spanish diacritical mark, used to represent the sound ‘ny’, where the 
    missing letter is ‘y’.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I particularly like “Across Your Dreams in Pale Battalions 
    Go”,  <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7] </a>in which Monk reworks the myth of Persephone, and features another 
    strong female subject.  It includes one of the technical devices she uses 
    frequently in ‘The Transparent Ones’, but also occurs elsewhere in her writing.  
    There are lines or verses in italics at the left hand margin, and then a verse 
    which is inset in ordinary type.  Sometimes the lines in italics seem to act 
    as commentary on the central verse, but at other times they act more as a 
    dialogue or antiphon.  As the woman (M) reads the “childs/ Persephone”, the 
    language of the poem becomes simultaneously child-like and Miltonic in its 
    desolation.  These are lines written from Eve and Persephone’s perspective:</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The female subject, Getha, in ‘Manufractured Moon’, is 
    the poet’s persona, with all her various attributes, some of which I referred 
    to earlier. ‘Manufractured Moon’ is a drama for radio written in the style 
    of a series of emails from Getha to some other person, an unknown friend.  
    I like the urgent, present tense nervy email style, which plays with, amongst 
    other things, the, often violent, urban and rural aspects of her locale late 
    at night.  The first email subject is “Fox barks”, and must also make a sly 
    reference to the Ted Hughes poem:</p>
  
<blockquote>
  Sat upright and owl-eyed 
    for hours so thoughts got to pellets &amp; droppings of words but to longhand 
    e-mail or fax foxes…</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘Manufractured Moon’ is also the most overtly feminist 
    of the texts in <i>Noctivagations</i>,  <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> This is manifest in a partial retelling 
    of a child’s street or playground game about wanting to “cross the golden 
    river”.  The children have to ask the “farmer’s” permission, and in Monk’s 
    version the farmer (father) becomes a sinister figure: “Farmer Dark-Force 
    may we par take our father’s boiled dinner as it is in heaven?”  The female 
    self is also evident in her dig at organised religion.  She describes a ‘Last 
    Supper of 2000’ hanging in her room, which shows Christ with a “heart shaped 
    cob” and all the male apostles.  Later she becomes convinced that one of the 
    apostles isn’t male at all, transforms him into Joan of Arc, and finally (he) 
    sashays around like Gilda, a star of the silver screen.  Monk makes her own 
    divinity in “Falling Outs”:</p>
  
<blockquote>
  The blind even quivered 
    as the iddy girl tungsten thin and burning bright fell out with all gods in 
    a big way such as only youngage can with starry id.</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is real menace in this urban night, particularly 
    in the figure of a threatening male stranger “flickering under the leaning 
    street-lamp”.  There is fear and horror, and an edge of madness in the penultimate 
    email: “Walls grin wetly.  And HE’s there again….”, and she signs off, or 
    trails off, as Get…. In the final email, however, he has been returned to 
    the lower case, and she is simply G. again, “Back on Track”.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alison Croggon recently gave a very interesting paper 
    on the writings of women mystics in mediaeval England, direct antecedents 
    (if we need any) of Geraldine Monk.  She writes:</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>…these texts suggest intriguing ways of looking at contemporary practices.  
    They are most subversive in how they assert their rational basis within contemporary 
    orthodoxies, which permits them to clear a space for a largely unheard female 
    vocabulary which then becomes its own authority.  Mere emotion is not enough; 
    mere intellectuality would not satisfy their desires nor permit a language 
    for female expressiveness.  <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
