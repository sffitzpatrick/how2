      <p class="doublespace">Recently I happened to watch 
    <i>Libertarias</i>, a Spanish film about the civil war, and was reminded of 
    the optimism that characterized Marxism and anarchism in the early stages 
    of development. This may well be a characteristic shared by all revolutions/revolutionary 
    ideologies in their initial phases, there’s a very moving quotation from an 
    old woman from the Congo upon hearing the good news that God was a loving 
    god: “There now! I was certain in my heart that there is a God like that.” 
    <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1" >[1]</a> And it struck me that one of the most impressive qualities of <i>Architectural 
    Body</i> is optimism, the delight, even, with which Gins and Arakawa articulate 
    a vision that, like Marxism and Christianity, offers a version of Utopia: 
    “In architecture we have the means to construct awareness on a new basis<i>.</i>”<i> 
    </i>(56) It is “the greatest tool available to our species, both for figuring 
    itself out and for constructing itself differently.” (xxi) Gins and Arakawa 
    write with the conviction that humans can achieve a version of heaven and, 
    like the Marxists, they locate it here on earth. In “Architecture as Hypothesis,” 
    a vision of this new world is presented in an imagined tour conducted by the 
    writers; their guests, Roger and Angela, move beyond their initial skepticism 
    to pleasure, understanding, ease, even expressing ideas that extend their 
    guides’ perceptions.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Interestingly, the last lines 
    of <i>Libertarias</i> express a vision of the earth renamed Freedom, the exploiters 
    are cast out and there will be an end to death (this is spoken over the dying 
    figure of a feminist/anarchist). Offers of immortality are ubiquitous in religion, 
    less common with ideologies and positively rare in architectural theory. Some 
    readers may choose to see the immortality promised by Gins and Arakawa as 
    metaphorical but this seems to ignore the integral position of “reversible 
    destiny” in the text. This concept is grounded in the importance of preserving 
    life: “That human life is expendable… is antithetical to any ethics putting 
    the highest value of all on the preserving of life.” (xvii) My difficulty 
    with this is that I’m not sure the preservation of life is or should be “highest” 
    in value. I see ethics as a constant negotiation of the claims of a number 
    of values that will not always unanimously point us in one direction. Anything 
    less seems an unwarranted simplification. But this is a qualification, rather 
    than an invalidation, of what Gins and Arakawa have to say, which is much 
    more complex and nuanced; not so much a program for achieving immortality 
    as a treatise exploring fresh and stimulating concepts of philosophy, perception, 
    identity, contingency and some pertinent hints as to what we should be spending 
    our money on.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Of course, Gins and Arakawa 
    realize how radical their notion of “reversible destiny” is and suggest a 
    less confronting way to understand it — “an open challenge to our species 
    to reinvent itself and to desist from foreclosing on any possibility, even 
    those our contemporaries judge to be impossible.” (xviii) Their optimism comes 
    without the blinkered certainty of the progress paradigm or the trade-offs 
    some religions extort. They joyously and consciously approach their project, 
    which to the average skeptical reader seems impossible; in fact impossibility 
    is not such an obstacle as the (apparently) sheer absurdity of suggesting 
    we could live forever and one asks — can they be serious? They are: serious 
    and joking/laughing — this work/play simultaneous as a child. They invoke 
    the Don, tilting at windmills: “why not indeed build the whole of the world 
    in which those windmills tilt…”. Acknowledging that their “contemporaries 
    look at the two of us as if we were Don Quixotes,” they relish the comparison: 
    “And indeed we tip our hats to a comparable indomitableness, even as we rush 
    to contrast our impossibilities with his. For our part, we never approach 
    anything impossible unless the setup is right.” (xix)</p>
  <p class="doublespace">There is, however, an odd, and 
    potentially problematic conjunction of ideas running through the text. Gins 
    and Arakawa approach identity and perception in a way that could almost be 
    described as common sense, if only it were common. They acknowledge the contingency 
    of personality in their explication of perception and the “organism that persons,” 
    a term used “because it portrays persons as being intermittent and transitory 
    outcomes of co-ordinated forming rather than honest-to-goodness entities.” 
    (2) Humans are no longer to be considered in brooding separation from life: 
    “the body needs to be defined together with that within which it moves… the 
    surroundings need to be defined together with bodies moving within them.” 
    (xx) “Isolating persons from their architectural surrounds leads to a dualism 
    no less pernicious than that of mind and body.” (44) These claims have that 
    rightness that is both old and new; like the best of visionaries, Gins and 
    Arakawa reveal to us what we realize we always knew.</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Their account of perception 
    is subtle and compelling in its conclusions: “Each of us becomes an everywhere 
    evenly distributed agent, dropping the centralizing habit that members of 
    our species have had for such a terribly long time.” (35) As for those who 
    wish to argue that we cannot trust the validity of sensory perception, an 
    argument I’ve always found not only specious but irrelevant — whether or not 
    this chair exists, I still intend to sit on it — Gins and Arakawa are equally 
    disbelieving: “It would also be ridiculous for someone using a flashlight 
    to find the path out of a labyrinthine cave and bumping up against uneven 
    walls and low overhangs or tripping upon rocks and stalagmites and then sliding 
    into and splashing through shallow puddles to wonder if indeed this might 
    be a hollowed-out figment of her imagination.” (42) This practicality also 
    manifests itself in an attack on abstraction and “thinking taken as a single 
    course of action… an outrageously reductive definition.” (53) Appealing again 
    to that bedrock of knowledge that lies somewhere beneath the accretions of 
    society and culture, they ask: “Does anyone really believe that a person could 
    ever be figured out as such in the abstract?” (6) And again, “Questions about 
    the nature and purpose of our species cannot be answered through reflection 
    alone.” (xiv). The world is a “mass of chaos, this massive mix of order and 
    chaos… people are forced to abstract in order to proceed, but any abstracting 
    requires that not as much be taken into consideration as ought to be. A person 
    can never get to the bottom of her own alertness.” (52)</p>
  <p class="doublespace">Gins and Arakawa seek to restore 
    life to us, in its complexity and difference: “A ruling concern is that nothing 
    conceivably belonging in the picture… be left out of it. This emphasis on 
    an all-inclusiveness, an inclination to attend to everything, naturally leads 
    to more specificity, a searching out of exact placements of, and uses for, 
    the elements and features of architectural environments.” (xix) And simultaneously 
    to restore us to our liveliness which has been dissipated by our consciousness 
    of mortality, we live in a “crisis condition which gets routinely covered 
    up… Much of the liveliness on this planet registers numb… All intellectual 
    efforts thus far, in East and West alike, have been largely stopgap measures.” 
    (xxv)</p>
  <p class="doublespace">However, sensible as much of 
    this is, how practical is a plan to prolong life indefinitely? Might not the 
    preservation of individual life be in conflict with preservation of the species 
    and, of course, the planet? Equally, while one admires the offhand way in 
    which economic considerations are dismissed, how practical or feasible is 
    this? To pose a question that is both banal and yet relevant — where does 
    the money come from? The world’s defence budgets would be ideal as a beginning, 
    of course, but how do we reach the point where that becomes likely? Further, 
    when the need for money for food/health/education is so pressing, can we justify 
    spending “enormous amounts” on developing an architecture that may help some 
    humans resolve their (our) existential problems?</p>
  <p class="doublespace">And yet, what the writers propose 
    is quite different to spending money on, for example, the sort of medical 
    research whose benefits, at best, might eventually trickle down to the lower 
    strata of the world community. If the U.S., say, was to adopt this principle 
    — “[e]conomic priority should be given to the resolving of existential puzzles: 
    What is this species in the first place? What lives and what dies?” (xxi) 
    — it would surely benefit not only millions of Americans, but a multitude 
    of others, inspired anew by the resurgence of revolutionary America. In such 
    a world, food/health/education would be taken care of, people would be taken 
    care of, for can anyone doubt that the importance of this would at last be 
    fully and completely acknowledged?</p>
  <p class="doublespace">As I indicated at this beginning 
    of this piece, <i>Architectural Body</i> is a visionary and revolutionary 
    work. It inspires one to believe that much more is possible than we’ve allowed 
    for, that we can move beyond the small adjustments and consolations of our 
    current existence to a new Eden “where people work and play at figuring out 
    what in the world they could possibly be.” (62) In a spirit of attentiveness 
    and inclusiveness, and acknowledging, as religion and ideology rarely do, 
    our uncertainty and tentativeness, Gins and Arakawa announce the possibility 
    of transcendence: “If we overflow with a sentient tentativeness (read awareness), 
    then transcendence is here and now and can and should be constructively and 
    crisis-ethically reworked — the spiritual and the critical become one.” (81)</p>
  <p class="doublespace">I have quoted extensively from 
    <i>Architectural Body</i> because one of the great pleasures of this text 
    is the way language is used. Poem/treatise/dialogue/manifesto — <i>Architectural 
    Body</i> is all of these. As manifesto, it sounds a note that seems to have 
    been absent too long — “Let our species cease being stunned into silence and 
    passivity, into defeatism, by an architecture that seems so accomplished but 
    that leads nowhere.” (39) Rousing stuff and yet was ever a manifesto so good-humoured 
    as this, so satisfactory in its combination of idealism and practicality, 
    the profound and the obvious (which, being so, is frequently neglected). (I 
    note in passing, this is one manifesto with no hit list.) Read it, read it 
    again and, if you are in a position to supply the authors with the funding 
    they require, do it for all of us.</p>
