      <p>The two armies face each other:<br>
        the one which has remained invisible<br>
        for millenniums and has come back into<br>
        light since a few decades,<br>
        advances imposingly in orderly columns.<br>
        There, under the huge hangar that<br>
        protects it, the “Terracotta Army”<br>
        deposits itself &#8212; in the mind’s eye &#8212;<br>
        as the majestic, unceasing march<br>
        of humanity. But the sacredness<br>
        of this image requires time to<br>
        sink in. We there, “extras”<br>
        in flesh and bone, too immersed<br>
        in the present, we visitors, too<br>
        talkative and hot, all of us,<br>
        too contemporary and thwarted<br>
        to perceive our tie with the past<br>
        and appear similar to them:<br>
        dignified, wise and measured.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Mongolian Outpost</b></p>
      <p>Here, north of Datong, the Great Wall<br>
        is not massive slabs of stone, crenellated<br>
        and well maintained as it is near Peking,<br>
        it does not have the appearance of a castle or fortress.<br>
        Left to itself, it is only a succession<br>
        of humps of yellow clay<br>
        between fields of corn and potatoes: camel’s<br>
        humps drawn by a child.<br>
        Here already for half an hour, on the back seat<br>
        of a red and ramshackle taxi, perched<br>
        on one of the humps with a view<br>
        of the valley and the peasant village<br>
        &#8212; once a Mongolian outpost &#8212; I listen<br>
        with amusement, without understanding a word,<br>
        to the reciprocal confessions &#8212; in Chinese &#8212;<br>
        between the driver and the interpreter<br>
        who is a member of the Party.<br>
        I laugh, I laugh to myself because<br>
        the dynamics of life have chosen to show me<br>
        right here, how that mythical, universal<br>
        imaginary of the Great Wall and of China<br>
        &#8212; which has fed my mind for more than 50 years<br>
        together with a youthful love of adventure,<br>
        a hankering for something great and unknown,<br>
        for something superior and non-experienced,<br>
        with Ulysses and Marco Polo as favourite heroes &#8212;<br>
        should materialize in a situation<br>
        so comic and convivial, to be experienced<br>
        as a country picnic with its socially relaxed<br>
        ways: lemonade, a snack, chatting, friends.</p>
