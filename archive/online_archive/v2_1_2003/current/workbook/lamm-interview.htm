    Lamm (</b><b>March 21, 2001)</b></P>

      <div class=Section1>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> You’ve written frankly about sex, 
          and I think <i>Skies</i> (2001)<i> </i>is interesting because it seems 
          less about sexuality or sex than sensuality, and a sensuality that isn’t 
          tied to a particular person or even act. Is that part of your understanding 
          of <i>Skies</i>?</p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Yea. I often think of sex writing 
          — whatever that is — in relation to something like dance movies, where 
          there is a little plot going on, and then people break into a dance. 
          Later when I saw porn, I thought oh, that’s the same structure. </p>
        <P class="doublespace">I think a lot can cover sex. In a way, you can 
          be writing about the sky. When I look at the book later I thought oh 
          my god, this is all about my relationship that I was in then, which 
          I talk about more as the book progresses. There were a number things 
          going on in that book, but one was to have a big project in a space 
          that was all my own. So I think <i>Skies </i>is driven by the same desire 
          as any other project. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><i>Cool for You</i> (2000)<i> </i>doesn’t really 
          have a lot of sex in it. I don’t know if you’ve read that. <i>Chelsea 
          Girls</i> (1997) is of course loaded with sex. One book, <i>Maxfield 
          Parrish</i> (1995), had tons of sex in it.<i> </i>My next book of poems 
          will have quite a lot of sex in it. It isn’t even that the sex comes 
          and goes, but writing about it does. Sometimes it seems like an interesting 
          thing to do, and sometimes it doesn’t even seem to be on the map. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Didn’t you teach a seminar at 
          Pratt that focused on writing about sex? I think you taught the work 
          of Dodie Bellamy and Colette. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Whenever I teach fiction or poetry, 
          I always make sex a specific assignment because I think it is the most 
          interesting. As a student, I was never asked to write about sex. And 
          then, to figure out if you should do that or not, because often you 
          could write something and have sex occur outside the room of the story, 
          and still have it be in the story.</p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> I read something in which you 
          discuss sex as an interesting way to tell time. &nbsp;</p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> I think in the early nineties it 
          was the only narrative that anyone I knew believed in. It seemed like 
          it was the last story, and it is a story that could be endlessly interrupted 
          and still told at the time. </p>
        <P class="doublespace">And of course, what does sex mean in terms of female 
          time and male time? Are we all having the same sex? Whether we’re having 
          sex with the same sex or the opposite sex, what is going on here? I 
          think that a lot of our sense of what narrative is and what drive is 
          has to do with the male sexual experience. </p>
        <P class="doublespace">I think when you look at the work of Virginia Woolf, 
          you ask is this a female sexual drive? That’s why I see <i>The Hours</i> 
          (1998)<i> </i>by Michael Cunningham as a failure. He was just doing 
          Virginia Woolf, but to no point. I think it was a guy using the greatest 
          woman writer of the twentieth century to describe his own homosexuality, 
          or to make her sex cover his sex, but what she was trying to do with 
          time and language I think probably had its roots in female sexuality. 
          He just imitated it, but it meant nothing. Underneath there was no there 
          there. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Speaking of guys and girls. Alice 
          Notley identified herself as a girl, or at least did in her work. She 
          talked about girl poets and guy poets. When I was studying <i>Skies, 
          </i>your small pieces really reminded me of some of the small, almost 
          epigrammic poems in <i>At Night the States</i> (1976), written after 
          the death of Ted Berrigan. Do you still discover their influence on 
          your work? </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> More than anything they were friends. 
          I was in Alice’s workshop two years after I came to New York. I think 
          Alice taught me how to be a student of writing, but she taught me how 
          to teach more than she taught me how to write. She was a great teacher, 
          and as a teacher, she always made it really clear that she was always 
          a student. She was always setting up situations that would produce writing. 
          Alice was in an endless workshop with herself as a writer. I still find 
          that in her books: she sets up an experiment, and drives it into the 
          ground. Her books are amazing and so excessive. I think she’s a master<b>. 
          </b>I always find plenty that I love, and plenty that I don’t like in 
          everything she does, and yet what I love is that she always has the 
          nerve to create a situation that produces writing. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Like the Robert Mitchum persona 
          in her new book <i>Disobedience</i> (2001)?<i> </i>&nbsp;</p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Yea. It is often really maddening. 
          She’s unstoppable. </p>
        <P class="doublespace">I certainly learned things from Alice, but Alice 
          herself would say that Eileen is not my student per se. I was fairly 
          close to her age, but I was of a different generation, and Alice would 
          lord that over me. But she was trying to get us to do something, and 
          I was trying to do something else, and there was sort of an argument 
          between us that I think to this day would persist with us as writers, 
          and that argument’s formed me, so sure, she’s an influence. </p>
        <P class="doublespace">I think Ted’s <i>Sonnets</i> (1967)<i> </i>are 
          the finest poems ever written. It’s just a masterpiece. Alice’s early 
          work, the work she wrote while I was in her workshop, probably influenced 
          me more than any other, a book called <i>Alice Ordered Me to be Made</i> 
          (1976)<i>. </i>It used the language of her then baby sons. Talk about 
          time. She used motherhood as a form to blow through as a poet. She occupied 
          the space of motherhood as an avant-garde poet. She did something that 
          men could have done, but wouldn’t or didn’t. I really feel like she 
          made something new in that moment. &nbsp;</p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> Particularly in the way she focused 
          her attention. There’s the poem in which she lists her son’s comics, 
          and there’s another poem in which she transcribes the language of her 
          son talking to a fork. There’s been so much poetry about women’s experiences 
          as mothers, but I’ve never seen that kind of attention to the oddities 
          of that world. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> Right, and I think it is because 
          she was there. In this workshop last night, someone wrote a really great 
          poem, and it was a very easy-seeming poem, but of course it was beautiful 
          and complex the more you looked at it, but it made you really notice 
          what an assemblage a poem is, an assemblage of exactly what is there. 
          You’re in this place, and then suddenly things start changing, and you 
          put things together as fast as they are occurring. I feel like that’s 
          the incredible awareness Alice brought to everywhere she’s been, but 
          particularly to motherhood. She was in front of these kids growing in 
          language and she made a poem out of that, which is so much more interesting 
          than say — how boring — all those poets teaching in the schools. They 
          say: here’s a poem my kid in school wrote. Whenever anybody is teaching 
          kids poetry, you always have to listen to those poems. But Alice hit 
          something much more rudimentary, which was to make poetry out of the 
          kids’ speech. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> You have this idea of writing 
          as notating your own mortality, which I think connects your work to 
          Notley’s in another way. In both your work and Notley’s there’s this 
          tension between the strength of the writer’s persona and its dissolution. 
          There’s the Notley poem entitled “Poem” (<i>Selected Poems, </i>23) 
          in which she describes St. Marks Place through the inevitability of 
          her absence and asserts her importance as a poet. I read <i>Skies</i> 
          in a related way, as a notation of mortality. </p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen: </b>Yea, I think there are a lot of 
          feelings of mortality in that book. I think that is part of what you 
          get when you go into nature. I started to have that experience a few 
          years ago, and started to understand how you could be in it. I guess 
          being in New York is being in it too, but its different when its water 
          and trees instead of concrete, and it lets itself get imprinted on your 
          poem. That’s what I mean about unwriting: letting the details write 
          you in a way, not really thinking about a void you write into with your 
          consciousness, but it is this weird dance of absence and presence.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> [1] </span></a> It is more like 
          you are allowing the poem to happen, and nature is incredibly sad in 
          this way, identical to the way a life is sad. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">Being of the 
          age when a lot of my friends — a few very close friends — but many friends 
          died of AIDS in the late eighties and early nineties. When that stopped 
          happening, some other people just died. Then there was that feeling, 
          when is it going to stop? And then it was like “Oh No!” I was forty 
          and now I’m fifty: this is what happens. You’re like this tree — it’s 
          so corny to say — all the leaves start to fall, and then you fall. This 
          is all part of a thing that I am in, and it never stops. When you’re 
          standing in the middle of an autumnal forest you can’t miss it. It is 
          beautiful to think about — you are those things. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          In the interview with Edward Foster, you made a great formulation about 
          men and women and the public/private divide. You said, “Men are distracted 
          and disturbed, too, but there’s something about being female and walking 
          down the street…There’s a privacy in public women do not have, and I 
          think a lot of my desires to be masculine are desires to be…In fact 
          the vast majority of my poetic models are men, and I am really interested 
          in public poetry and a private person’s public nature” (60). </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">I read <i>Skies 
          </i>as a private text, and a person’s private relation to death, but 
          now that I am listening to you talk, I am reminded how public death 
          is.</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          In a way people keep dying after they die. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          In the poem “Inauguration Day” (2001) you write that the snow “gives 
          me time / to think, to vote / for the future of everyone” (lines 61-63). 
          I thought this was a nice way to think about the poet in public world 
          but also in the private lives of people. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          When one is an individual and starts to make some peace with the notion 
          that you too will die, once that starts to be clear, you realize other 
          people will continue to work. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">One of the things 
          that is really important to me, and really disturbing in terms of men 
          and women and poetry is that so often when a guy is remembered on a 
          back of a book, it is always men validate men, and men carry on other 
          men’s work, when in fact I am influenced by that canon and I am carrying 
          on Jimmy Schuyler’s work, and I am carrying on Frank O’Hara’s work, 
          and I am carrying on John Weiner’s work. I am part of that lineage. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">So often when 
          guys creates lineages it is a guys’ lineage, and I am supposed to carry 
          on Alice’s work, and I am, but I am also carrying on Ted’s. We really 
          need to change our sense of lineage in big ways. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">You look at the 
          New York School and its all these guys and a woman, and subsequent generations 
          of men change their mind about who that woman was, no matter who that 
          woman was. <i>An Anthology of New York Poetry </i>(1970) came out and 
          the young guys who edited it didn’t like Barbara Guest’s work, so they 
          took it out and put in Bernadette Mayer. The female place is always 
          disposable. As long as that’s true, there’s no parity between male and 
          female poets. It’s like, women can have their place over here, and even 
          if women are in male poetry establishments, if you keep looking at it, 
          female poets are still<b> </b>getting rewarded by men, not for being 
          the great female poets, but being the female poets who are the most 
          feminine, or the most supportive of men, or women who already have lots 
          of power in the male establishment. You don’t see women being honored 
          for writing work that really changes things for women. I don’t mean 
          that the work has to be full of feminist statements, but just a kind 
          of an edgy reality, which is what it means to be female in the world. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          You have said similar things about men and mourning for AIDS: men mourning 
          men, and speaking for men. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          There’s a moment there when the ranks get very tight, and it is very 
          easy for a female mourner to be out. When Tim Dlugos died, the guys 
          swamped in and wrote all the introductions to the books, and I’m glad 
          David Trinidaid edited <i>Powerless</i> (1996)<b> </b>and <i>Strong 
          Place</i> (1992) but I couldn’t believe the lack of women’s names in 
          the introduction to the life of a guy who had so many female friends. 
          He was one of my best friends, and there’s no evidence that I even knew 
          him. When there was the event for Joe Brainard at PS1, and he had a 
          lot of female friends, and there were a few women there: me, Ann Lauterbach, 
          and not many gay men. A lot happens when a poet dies in terms of how 
          they get re-written. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          Thinking about mourning and men and people on the way to dying. I am 
          obsessed with the short story “Chelsea Girls” (1997). I was thinking 
          about this story in terms of your work carrying on his influence. Did 
          Schuyler’s work help make the sexuality of your work possible? </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          Well, he had a great deal of comfort about being an out gay man in his 
          work. He was finishing <i>The Morning of the Poem</i> (1981) when I 
          first started to work with him. His social style was always an enactment 
          of it. I would come tell him about last night, and he would talk about 
          the old days. Poetry is gossip. He really liked that I was a dyke. It 
          was very entertaining for him, and in an odd way he was even proud of 
          it. It was kind of a familial thing. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">There was a bratty 
          pleasure when I wrote “Chelsea Girls” because I thought that to write 
          a story, you had to wait a few years, and that had been my pattern with 
          fiction, but I wrote that right after Jimmy died. I made myself do it. 
          I had a feeling that I should get right to it. I set up a whole situation. 
          I used to have a different arm chair in this apartment that was <i>my 
          chair</i>, and I threw a yellow legal pad next to it and I just made 
          a deal with myself because I didn’t have what it usually took to write 
          a story, but I was hell-bent on writing the story, so I decided that 
          I would write it like a poem. I have a much more fragmented sense of 
          how to write a poem, so every time I would come in the door I would 
          sit down and get to the next place in the story. So I wrote it in this 
          raggedy way, and the story immediately allowed for separate rooms. But 
          also, I thought if I’m being his female memoirist, then I am going to 
          get some pussy in there. I am going to put something in here that gay 
          men might not want to hear about — Jimmy would have been fine, he was 
          always saying dirty things to me as part of our joke, “Did you get any 
          pussy last night Eileen?” — but say other members of his generation 
          wouldn’t be that way. I was getting the shape of my own friendship in 
          by making sure that my own lesbian history was neck and neck with my 
          reverence for this man, so I wouldn’t be erasing myself as I was memorializing 
          him. </span></p>

          Was <i>Cool for You </i>written before or after <i>Skies</i>?</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen: </b>They 
          were written at the same time. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          <i>Skies </i>seems like a compression of your voice and imagery, and 
          <i>Cool for You</i> seems to be an opening out of your persona and your 
          story. Did you find a real distinction between writing prose and poetry? 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          One of the things about writing a book of prose is that you are really 
          in it. It is kind of gross. It is like being buried alive in a way. 
          Once you know you have a book going, you kind of feel like you are never 
          free in a horrible way. So then poetry becomes kind of an escape — you 
          get to go out and breathe. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">I didn’t think 
          I was writing poems when I started <i>Skies. </i>I just saw the glorious 
          sky in P-town, and I was thinking I would write another collection of 
          short stories called <i>Skies. </i>The only thing that would make the 
          stories linked was that I would write all the sky stuff in between. 
          I would figure out some architecture to make that work. So that was 
          the idea and I just started writing the skies…</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
          </b>The architecture became the plane in the poems. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          Yea, that’s interesting, because a lot of things happen in them<b>. 
          </b>Yeah, the planes link it; it’s true. I just never wrote the stories. 
          So I got deeper into <i>Cool for You, </i>but once I realized what I 
          was doing, that I was writing poems, I could really say the poems are 
          this, and the novel is this, and they really were in separate places. 
          But also when you are writing a lot of fiction, or something that has 
          narrative, then poetry doesn’t have to do that. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">Towards the end 
          of <i>Skies</i>, it seemed like it was time to put the people back, 
          because I felt I had gone so far out in writing there weren’t people 
          in my poems. In the new poems that I’m writing now seem much more narrative 
          and human; there’s much more of a connection between people in them, 
          which is a different relationship. <i>Skies </i>is a relationship — 
          about a poet and nature, and the other is a relation between people. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          It seems that your work as a poet helped you know where and when to 
          begin and end a narrative. I am always surprised how your stories open 
          and close, and I thought that perhaps this is the case because you were 
          a poet first. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          The gap between chapters and paragraphs is so interesting. As poets 
          we know it so well for a lot of reasons, but one of them is giving poetry 
          readings. You’ve got a half an hour to fill. I remember Larry Fagin 
          saying a million years ago — was it him? — you should be going in with 
          humor and going out with beauty. People do stuff like that, you really 
          have to open the audience up and make people feel comfortable to go 
          through all these rises and falls, but you’re really aware of structuring 
          some time publicly when you’re assembling a poetry reading. You read 
          a poem, and now the room feels this way. So what can I put into that 
          space that will keep the energy going? I really felt like I used those 
          kind of principals when I was arranging the book. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
          </b>Can you read an audience as well as you think you can when you are 
          standing right there in front of them?</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          There’s always paranoia. There are so many different kinds of quiet: 
          the quiet attentive, the quiet bored, the quiet dissatisfied, the quiet 
          in awe. Patter helps. I’ve gotten better at doing that because I read 
          a lot. You can tell who they are by what they respond to when you speak 
          almost more than when you read the poem. Pretending they’re there when 
          I’m writing keeps my fingers moving. They are me, of course. When you’re 
          writing the audience is just paranoia. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          In a talk which you gave at St. Marks in 1994 entitled “The Lesbian 
          Poet,” and reprinted in <i>School of Fish</i> (1997), you say: “I think 
          we write all our poems with our metabolism, our sexuality, for me a 
          poem has always been an imagined body of a sort, getting that down in 
          time, it moves this way and that, it is full of its own sense of possibility” 
          (124). I think you’ve already answered this, but I am curious what the 
          imagined body of prose writing is? Is it your own corpse, being buried 
          alive? </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          No, well, in a way, I think the body vanishes in prose, and I’ve always 
          felt this as both as a reader and a writer. As a prose writer, you sit 
          down at the computer or whatever and you start to go and you create 
          a situation. At a certain point, you evacuate, and when you’re lost 
          in prose, you’re gone. It’s a virtual leap into this other world that 
          truly exists. Same as a reader, you get lost in a book.</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">I think poetry 
          isn’t about getting lost. It is much more about scoring the plane of 
          existence that you’re dwelling in. I often think — and I have been drawing 
          away from this a little bit — that poetry is a human form; I really 
          want the body to be there in the real time of the writing. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          In “The Lesbian Poet” (<i>School of Fish</i>, 1994), you describe coming 
          out as a dyke and a poet during your first poetry reading. Could you 
          talk more about sexuality and textuality (or even performativity) becoming 
          synonymous or coincident for you? </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          I think it is about energy. When I had a card I hadn’t played as a person, 
          so there was something I wanted to do that I hadn’t done yet — once 
          I started to think that I would do it, or was doing it, or this was 
          a possibility. Then I began to realize in a very profound way, one could 
          be wedded to movement. Also, I operated in a very conservative way. 
          I came to New York and thought I would do something I hadn’t done in 
          Boston, without even knowing what that was. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">It is weird to 
          say but I felt like I needed to earn my poetry cards first. I hung around 
          for a couple years, and was part of the gang and stuff. I think by the 
          time I was part of the St. Marks scene and I got my first Wednesday 
          night reading there, in the fall of ’77, I was in love with a girl for 
          the first time and willing to say so and willing to write about it, 
          and it just seemed like some wonderful new operation started to occur 
          in my poems at that time too. There was a limitation of energy that 
          I didn’t have to work with anymore. I felt I had a much more expansive 
          frame to move with. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          There are many great moments in <i>Cool for You</i>, but one I found 
          particularly touching came about early in the book, when Eileen is chosen 
          to be Mrs. Lesters’ teacher’s helper at the Fidelity house, where she 
          has been taking and excelling at her art lessons, particularly drawing. 
          Eileen decides not to become the teachers’ assistant because her father 
          has died, and she wants to get a job and be responsible for her mom. 
          You write: “I remember the day I told Mrs. Lester. I was really afraid. 
          I thought she would be mad, and miss me. She looked at me nervously. 
          Okay Dear if that’s what you want to do. I walked down the street crying, 
          walking home. I wondered what being her helper would have been like. 
          I swung my bag. Let the babies help themselves. Art is for kids” (33). 
          There are so many complicated feelings compressed into this perfectly 
          discrete narrative moment. I also like the fact that the writing was 
          thoroughly invested in and absorbed in the emotions of <i>that</i> moment, 
          for that girl who just lost her dad. It was filtered through the adult 
          narrator’s memory, but not explicitly. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          I have started to notice when I read memoirs and first-person narratives 
          that when the writer goes into the narration they stop being the kid 
          and they become the adult. I just feel there is something inauthentic 
          about that. Shouldn’t the kid be doing all the jobs? And aren’t you 
          pushed more, language wise, to figure out how the kid really sees her 
          reality? To not drop the mask of the kid ever, but to stay in there, 
          and try and figure out how she puts a bookcase together or a room together, 
          how the kid goes out the door, and what eating is, make all the details 
          of the reality seen through the kid’s eyes. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> 
          [2] </a></p>
        <P class="doublespace">In Susan Minot’s 
          new book <i>Rapture </i>(2002), there’s a moment where two lovers are 
          walking into a hotel room and she knows he has a girlfriend back in 
          New York, and as they are walking into the hotel room, the phone rings, 
          and she urges him to pick it up, and he picks it up, and says “Honey” 
          and the narrator’s heart drops. It’s that cold-blooded ability to change 
          selves. We’ve all seen that moment in different ways, and a person’s 
          ability to change sides is a little too creepy.</p>
        <P class="doublespace">And I feel this 
          in fiction, and I think this could be in some way posturing. I like 
          the myth of the true self, which is being constructed throughout the 
          book, in all places, and it’s a construction of course, but I just feel 
          there’s something loyal and good and true when a writer make the one 
          perspective do all the work, rather than watch that bourgeois accommodation 
          occur: the always returning to that conscious control, the middle. I 
          hate that. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
          </b>It is interesting that you mentioned “cards” in your discussion 
          of sexuality and poetry, and in <i>Cool for You, </i>you are very attentive 
          to the details of the card from the Fidelity House. It’s plum colored, 
          and you even describe the sound of it as it fell on the ground.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">

        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly: 
          </b>I am curious about how you see your work within the tradition of 
          American literature, particularly since you grew up from Massachusetts…</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          There’s this whole thing of “Massachusetts” in Massachusetts. It’s kind 
          of gross because in a way it is no place because it is so hung up on 
          its past, despite the fact that Massachusetts is working class, i.e. 
          pretty recent immigrants are living there who have nothing to do with 
          that past — the people who came to the country and still own it, and 
          then of course there’s the black community was brought there in chains. 
          Yet there are all these old houses and there is that strange aura about 
          all that old American history, and growing up around it that and you 
          can’t help measuring yourself against it. That’s part of the monstrousness 
          of Massachusetts. There’s that creepy detail I know I used in the book. 
          It’s so weird to realize that the people who were forced out of Ireland 
          by starvation were in fact forced by ancestors of the same people they 
          would come and be servants to. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">But I love the 
          idea, and I’m very wedded to the idea of being an American poet. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">The whole Donald 
          Allen mid-twentieth-century poetry movement was the first wave of the 
          inheritors of William Carlos Williams’ idea that this was an American 
          language and that they were writing in it. It has a variable foot, and 
          it’s erratic. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">It is my own 
          belief that this is a violent country, and it’s a violent language that 
          we write and speak in and to pretend to that it’s otherwise…That’s why 
          I am not interested in writing a literary language and I’m a little 
          bit adamant about that<b>. </b>I want to be broken and I am broken. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">Class is so fluid. 
          We were working-class, or lower-middle class, but my mother wanted us 
          to speak better, and she was a child of immigrants. Polish was her first 
          language. She really wanted us to speak correctly, and yet there was 
          so much more adventure available with the kids next door who spoke pretty 
          bad English. We wanted to speak like them, because speaking like them 
          meant you could move like them and go where they went. I think there’s 
          a way in which the only people who don’t put their past behind them 
          are ruling class white men who happen to speak the language of power, 
          and all the rest of us are supposed to hide that for them, or hide behind 
          that with them. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">There’s accommodation 
          for Black English, because we — the liberal white culture — want to 
          make sure Black people can become literate and that means allowing them 
          speak the way they speak and calling that a language too, but to not 
          to extend that same openness to other Englishes seems weird and even 
          telling — that the whole thing’s the fraud. </span></p>

          by her seventeen year stay in an institution, Westborough State Hospital. 
          There are ways in which Eileen’s life in and with institutions connects 
          to her grandmother’s life: Catholic school, the American family, her 
          job at the Fernald School (a state school for the mentally retarded) 
          and her job at a nursing home. Were you pursuing these parallels? Particularly

        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          The thing that wound up being really strange and interesting was that 
          I in fact learned a lot from the state. I had to go to volunteer lawyers 
          from the arts to figure out how to get my records from the state of 
          Massachusetts and then my brother, because he lived in the state of 
          Massachusetts, had to sign the papers. It was interesting. It was though 
          I wasn’t enough of a Myles to get Nellie’s papers, I had to get my brother 
          Terry Myles in there. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">But what I learned 
          from those records is that the state had, in a certain way, preserved 
          the history of my family more than anything we have. I just got a photograph 
          of my dad that I had never seen. I never thought of my brother as this 
          twenty-three year old unemployed guy living at home. So, there’s this 
          weird way in which the state preserves too. </span></p>

          An archive in a way. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          Like a messy and bad archive. You know how it is, when you learn how 
          to read, every wrong detail started to become telling. So there was 
          something also beautiful about it too. And I started to realize that 
          it was the place we went to the most, and there were more pictures of 
          us with her at the Westborough State Hospital than there is of us anywhere 
          else. I used the solar system as a metaphor in <i>Cool for You</i> a 
          lot and Nellie was the sun, and remained the sun, and when she died, 
          my dad died four years after she did. It was so weird that she managed 
          to keep him alive. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:

          Certain of My Poems” (<i>Not Me</i>, 1991), which describes the inspiration 
          and the making of “Romantic Pain.” You mentioned the World Trade Towers 
          in “Romantic Pain.” You write that they are “immensely quiet and barely 
          / lit” (lines 26-27). How has the focus you have brought to New York

          New York. I was aware of all that, and I just felt sad that people wouldn’t 
          see this happen. The poem ended with “We miss you.” So it was a buried 
          mourning poem. The people seemed like the flowers — not to beat the 
          metaphor — but it expressed a particular kind of sadness for the people 
          who wouldn’t make it home. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> The other thing about “’Romantic 
          Pain’” I am interested in: that great moment in which you’re smoking 
          a cigarette — I think it is in the Staten Island Ferry bathroom — there 
          are two other women there, and you see the three of you from above, 
          looking at yourselves in the mirror: “I can see us from overhead / and 
          call the configuration ‘Feminism’” (lines 69-70) Do you see feminism 
          differently now? Particularly since you went on tour with Sister Spit?<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> 
          [5] </a></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          I know some people who were deeply into the second wave of feminism 
          as writers and artists, and maybe I was too young or not in the right 
          class. I didn’t really play in that field of feminism. There never seemed 
          to be a culture of feminism. It may have been there but it didn’t have 
          an impact on me. I wasn’t affected by the art of feminism. I wasn’t 
          affected by the poetry of feminism.  I didn’t think it even created 
          new styles. But what I am really aware that there’s just this fucking 
          incredible young female culture in visual art, music, writing, and dance, 
          that seems to be the strongest culture that I know of — male or female. 
          I saw Le Tigre in Portland last week. The new record<i>, Feminist Sweepstakes, 
          </i>has really great lyrics. I just had someone burn me a copy, but 
          I think I am going to buy it so I can read the lyrics. It’s wonderful 
          poetry, and its very Ra-ra feminism. They have videos and movies behind 
          them when they perform, and so they were projecting the lyrics to the 
          songs onto the screen too. And Kathleen Hanna would say, “we’re doing 
          radical feminist karaoke,” and getting the audience to scream back the 
          lines, and the lines were really bold great female poetry — just fun 
          and cool. I just saw that as something I had never really seen before. 
          It was politics and aesthetics. Who could be more rock-n-roll than Kathleen 
          Hanna? This was not girl’s rock. It just wasn’t a separate category. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I began with frankness, so I think I’ll end there. You are frank about 
          the relationship between class and language. Holland Cotter quotes you 
          saying, “You know so much about people from the second they open their 
          mouths. Right away you might know that you might want to keep them out. 
          So when I write, I want to keep changing the locks, saying the ‘wrong’ 
          thing when I’m doing the right thing.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> 
          [6] </a> I am intrigued by this intersection of “right” 
          and “wrong” in the poem. Can a poem bring the voice into the cultural 
          hierarchy that poetry often signifies and also maintain an explicit 
          resistance to that hierarchy?</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          Is there one implicit hierarchy or is there a series of them? I feel 
          like part of what a poem is doing is jumbling codes. What we were talking 
          about in terms of the jumps fiction or poetry readings can make, poems 
          make those jumps line to line. You don’t want to do it so much that 
          nobody can follow you, but it is interesting just when you have created 
          a certain kind of gestalt to slide into another one. Or, just when you 
          think you’ve written a <i>New Yorker</i> poem, put some pussy in. Sexual 
          language keeps being attractive because it changes the register so radically. 
          It has so much power — obviously — to open the doors to one room, and 
          close the doors to another. It is a living architecture of consciousness. 
          </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace">I want to be 
          challenged as a human being in terms of how many kinds people I can 
          be, how many ways I can be open, how many adjustments I can make. You 
          have to, just to exist in the day. Everyday is this crazy little jungle 
          gym of adjustments just to keep your sanity and keep functioning, and 
          keep receiving messages and sending messages. I love the idea that a 
          poem can do that. So it’s a little map of consciousness that says: this 
          is what it is like to be alive. </span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I wanted to finish with the essay “The End of New England,” in <i>on 
          my way</i>. You focus on the way your sister leaves out the “p” of napkin, 
          and you express longing for what your sister left out: “My sister said 
          ‘nakin’ she adamantly dropped the p, I miss her, I miss my family, it 
          was another way to say us. Nakin” (69). Do you see language as home?</span></p>
        <P class="doublespace"><b>Eileen:</b> 
          Oh yeah. Absolutely, completely and utterly. I took a trip to Russia 
          in 1995, and I swear I almost had a nervous breakdown because I couldn’t 
          be received in the way that I always had been. It was such an identity 
          loss, and I so wanted to come home. And really, I wanted to be home 
          in my language. </span></p>
