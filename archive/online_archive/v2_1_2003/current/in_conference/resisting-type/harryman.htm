      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here 
    we see that the poet is inside of an enclosure, with a door locked from the 
    outside. A plaque that says “poet inside” with an arrow pointing to the locked 
    door tells me that the poet has made something she can’t get out of. Or, like 
    Antigone, she has been put away. The poet is either dead or alive and in either 
    case is not accessible.  Below the enclosure is a tombstone in the shape of 
    a pin one can wear on a shirt pocket with the word <b>Iraqi</b> printed 
    on it. The pin is itself a tomb marked as in memoriam to a poet, Dan Davidson. 
    Dan Davidson is the poet who circulated the Iraqi pins during the Gulf War. 
    I wore the pin during the Gulf War fairly regularly and was the recipient 
    of largely friendly looks and pleasantly unanticipated conversations from 
    mostly Arab immigrant and Arab American shopkeepers of various religions and 
    nationalities. I was also the recipient of curious questions, like are you 
    from Iraq? Or, I didn’t know you were from Iraq! from non-Arab literal minded 
    American types, like parents at my kid’s school who did not understand the 
    meanings of the pin as readily as those from the Middle East. One of the more 
    curious conversations involved a young woman who took the pin to be a kind 
    of confession, a mixed declaration of guilty culpability and coming-out as 
    Iraqi. It was for her an invitation to exchange confidences, hers being that 
    she had an excess of facial hair and that she was terrified that her husband 
    would find out about it. To me this made some sense, when I thought about 
    it from her perspective. I was an Arab with non-Arab features, so I could 
    hide behind my western looks and thereby avoid scrutiny and possible condemnation 
    visited upon other Arab Americans. She, on the other hand, could use a razor 
    to hide threatening gender-confusing physical characteristics, thereby avoiding 
    unsettling scrutiny and possible rejection by her husband.  We were both, 
    in a sense, in the same boat: we had had something to hide until this private 
    moment of mutual outing, even if I hadn’t been deliberately hiding something 
    like she had.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    people from the Arab speaking world understood the emblem <b>Iraqi</b> 
    as signifying human solidarity with their potential suffering—both as subjects 
    of national prejudice and as people who had personal ties to a world under 
    attack. The pin was also understood as a protest against the U.S. raid on 
    Iraq: a person wearing the pin was understood to align herself with victims 
    of war. It was interesting to see who did and didn’t understand or respond 
    to or responded negatively to Davidson’s signifying game.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    2 Scene 2:</b>  </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“If 
    I meet a stranger how do I know he is a stranger?” Gertrude Stein</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If this 
    were a performance, I would now redirect your attention to another pod of 
    whatever room we happened to be in. You would find yourself in the middle 
    of a play by Gertrude Stein:</p>
   <P>Performer 
    occupies a formally unoccupied piece of turf</p>
      <P >Second Act: What is the earth<br>
        Second Act: The earth is altogether with or without water.<br>
        Second Act: With or without thunder<br>
        Second Act: No, with or without water.<br>
        Third Act: That is what the earth is with or without water.<br>
        Third Act: And what are people.<br>
        Third Act: People are all over<br>
        Third Act: Do you mean all over<br>
        Third Act: No I do not mean all over.<br>
        Third Act: Do you not do you not mean all over.<br>
        Third Act not necessarily sad. No I do not mean all over the earth and 
        even if I did I would not even if I did have it all over.<br>
        Third Act: Why not<br>
        Third Act: Because not.<br>
        Third Act: Because if the people are all over the earth which they are 
        it is not all over.<br>
        Third Act: Not all over</p>
   <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:150%'>       Please kindly notice that “over” is two syllables and 
    that makes all the trouble. Trouble has two syllables too.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In a 
    performance, what would happen in this juxtaposed use of Stein, whose open-to-interpretation 
    values for the performance of her plays I share, is that the discussion preceding 
    the extract from her play would infect the semantic meaning of her work—an 
    inference would be brought forth that at this present moment a poet behind 
    a locked door, a no longer living poet, Iraqi, and people are connected and 
    that there is a simultaneity made between the word “Iraqi” in my exposition 
    and the word “people” in Stein’s play.  Another way to perform this piece 
    would be to deliver each speech simultaneously. Simultaneity, a value incidentally 
    put forth in the Italian Futurist “Synthetic Theater Manifesto” that “captures 
    the confused fragments of interconnected events encountered in everyday life,” 
    is a tactic that encompasses any number of possible outcomes and is a good 
    device for investigating relationships of text to voice to content to context.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">(…so 
    formal strategies are not married to content—and if you want to hear more 
    about this please ask me after the show.)</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Performer 
    then demonstrates two versions of simultaneity</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    2 scene 3: </b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Senator 
    Byrd: “The American people have a better understanding of the constitution 
    than those who are elected to represent it.”</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    2 scene 4:</b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Further 
    discussion</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    <b>Iraqi</b> pin allowed or dared anybody who had the nerve to wear 
    it to become an artist, a performance artist. The conversations I had at the 
    time with strangers reminded me of some 70’s performance art, for instance, 
    of some of Eleanor Antin’s public performance work of that period, including 
    a piece called something like <i>the King, Duke, or Earl of San Diego</i>, 
    in which she wandered around in a silly get-up—bowler hat and fake mustache 
    and beard piece, the accoutrements of the archetypal Huck Finn confidence 
    trickster nobility—engaging local folks in conversation. I imagine Antin’s 
    performance as an intervention, meant to disrupt the stranger/neighbor barrier 
    in self-guarded sub(urban) Southern California neighborhoods. Her drag/vaudeville, 
    transparent as it was, was probably intended as a user-friendly way of negotiating 
    conversations through gender divides while demonstrating the loosening of 
    the regulations of gender in public space. I thought, I could/would never 
    walk around in a silly costume to attract attention in this way. Well it turns 
    out that’s true, but not true, at the same time. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Performer 
    removes <b>Iraqi</b> pin and applies <b>illegal alien</b> pin 
    here.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    2 scene 5:</b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“There 
    is no curtain because it does happen.” Gertrude Stein</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
    interested me about the Iraqi pin performance is first that I felt compelled 
    to wear the pin whether I wanted to or not. In fact, I dreaded wearing it 
    just as one dreads the turn of events in a tragedy or melodrama. I the poet 
    like being ignored and keeping my own space in public. Therefore, it challenged 
    me the performer to engage with strangers: I am not constituted to converse 
    with people I don’t know. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I avoided 
    conversations with parents at my son’s school when I could. The person wearing 
    the pin calls attention to the pin and becomes, by virtue of wearing it, responsible 
    to whatever interpretations of the pin one encounters. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    objective of Davidson’s performance was to diffuse the theater of war and 
    to dramatize the real life conflations that lead to the targeting of Iraqi 
    subjects as enemies. As a performer of the pin, one becomes responsible in 
    a local context to major world events. The performer citizen engages in a 
    dialogic meditation that exceeds the limits of conventional narrative and 
    argumentation as she becomes aware of her personhood stripped of reductive 
    theatrics and narratives of identity. As with much performance art of the 
    70’s, Davidson’s work is partly about the performer’s experience itself; and 
    like the performance values of the modernist avant-garde, it assertively provokes 
    a response to emerging states of affairs. It is combative and sociable, inward 
    and outward looking, dialogic and positional.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    3 Scene 1: </b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Senator 
    Byrd: “Perhaps it is that the citizen’s understanding is not filtered through 
    the prism of election year politics.”</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Yet, 
    the challenge of writing anything has been at stake for me since the U.S. 
    response to 9/11 became an excuse to militarize against Iraq. The pleasure 
    in the idea that I could be writing about my own art activity and its genre 
    excesses is contradicted by the loss of a sense of what? Form? Desire? Motivation? 
    What do I mean by a loss of a sense of form-desire? And might this then be 
    the very place to begin talking about the text as written for the page and 
    as written for performance and is there a difference? Or perhaps what I am 
    experiencing is not exactly a loss of a sense of form-motivation, but the 
    signal of a breaking point. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Scene 
    2 Act 3:</b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
    comes first, the poetry or the theater? What comes first, the poetry or the 
    prose?  First the discourse or the poetry?  The essay or the story?  Narrative 
    or the non-narrative? What comes first, the embodied word or the thrown object? 
    What comes first, the object or the subject? Subject eating the object or 
    the object absorbing the subject? </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What 
    is emphasized, the skeleton or the muscle?</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I would 
    prefer to emphasize the skeleton. I would prefer the movement to be the movement 
    of the muscles lifted by the skeleton. When the muscles are not lifted by 
    the skeleton they become athletic. One becomes aggressive and competitive. 
    The theater becomes a theater of conflict. And somebody has to win.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Mis 
    en scene</i>:  A redistribution 
    of language as testing ground </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    4: The Middle:</b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1982, 
    I wrote an experimental essay, which, now that I look back at it, points to 
    the problem of answering this question about resisting type. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    book begins with three short paragraphs:</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Who 
    limits herself to “All I can say. All I can say” gives herself over to a kind 
    of conservatism.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
    oblique judgment or observation is mystifying to me. But it is very much part 
    of what interests me.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Characterizing 
    the middle where what’s enlarged (subjective) and what’s reduced (external) 
    by speaking gather.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    circumambient considerations of this anti-manifesto, <i>The Middle</i>, involve 
    a critique of tragedy and fated, or unidirectional causal narratives, a preference 
    for comedy and playfulness e.g. multiplicity and change, and a performative 
    display of the values for mediating between the abyss of “expressive” subjectivity 
    (hyper self-awareness to the exclusion of the world) and the reduced value 
    of external reality that the intensification of subjective expressivity can 
    entail.  The 22 pages of <i>The Middle</i>—what I am calling here an anti-manifesto—is 
    composed in the following sub-genres and styles, understanding here that sub-genre 
    and style are conflated: aphoristic prose, story telling, the genre of elaborate 
    and prolonged citation, the genre of fake citation, collage appropriation, 
    drama, dialogue, <i>recit</i>, prose poetry, faked poetry (that which imitates 
    another’s style almost effectively), and false autobiography. The essay is 
    art but it is not purely a fictional or poetic essay and thus it has also 
    conflated art and analytic discourse, as have numerous of my other writings.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is 
    a little impossible to construct a narrative by which one can pigeonhole the 
    writing, or stabilize it, long enough to be able to say that it ever went 
    from any one genre to another. My approach to writing <i>per se</i> has elicited 
    its variation in genre. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Notes to the director </b>of <i>The Ear of the Poet in the Mouth of 
    the Performer</i>:</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">First 
    you will have to decide whether or not this is indeed a play or a performance 
    of any kind. Once you have made this decision, consider the following:</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I sometimes 
    call the kind of theater I do (and sometimes dream about. but don’t do) “poet’s 
    theater” after the American traditions of poet’s theater from T.S. Elliot 
    to Frank O’Hara, after the longer tradition of theater written as poetry, 
    and after the San Francisco Bay Area Poet’s Theater I took part in from 1978-1984 
    or so and have more recently refigured in a broader interdisciplinary context.  
    I could also call it avant-garde performance, a kind of performance that recognizes 
    the sources and values of early 20th c. performance art of Futurism, Constructivism, 
    Dada, Surrealism, Bauhaus, and Gertrude Stein. What I retain of this earlier 
    avant-garde is not a preservation through imitation or slavish copying but 
    an interest—an interest in using live performance as a mode of exploring new 
    ideas or ideas that are difficult, provisional, anti-tragic, in the mode of 
    becoming, on the way, emerging.  </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My earlier 
    demonstrative discussion of Dan Davidson’s <b>Iraqi </b>pin indicates 
    something about the intersection between the practice of poetry and performance 
    art that leads to an approach to poet’s theater. However, what is most important 
    to me, as a playwright, is the performative deployment of language in live 
    space. It is language that is itself character, activity, or event of all 
    of my plays. In this sense, the plays are not dissimilar from my other writing.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Each 
    of my plays assumes a different set of problems in respect to language and 
    performance. And a criteria for my plays thus far has been that they have 
    to have an autonomous integrity on the page apart from performance. Since 
    I think paradoxically about the question of autonomy, e.g. “ìt never wins,” 
    I am interested in making plays that in addition to having autonomous integrity 
    as written literary work, must be recreated from scratch each time they are 
    staged.  The staging is never an illustration of the text just as the visual 
    elements of the <i>mis en scene </i>are never made to illustrate the action 
    or meaning of the play. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Of this 
    play and essay, <i>The Ear of the Poet in the Mouth of the Performer</i>, 
    the director will need to understand that its site(s) are not an actual locality: 
    it exists in both discursive and referential space. It is to be situated as 
    the work of a political activist, and it is addressing a kind of homework 
    assignment for authors. The bias of the text is that political activism is 
    necessary to the artist (even if not the artist identified as “author”) and 
    that the homework assignment is peculiarly a kind of medium that allows that 
    artist or (did I mean activist?) to communicate with friends, colleagues, 
    and others who want to think about the maker’s relationship to, yes, medium, 
    and yes, genre. </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So rather 
    than creating a boring <i>mis en scene </i>with chalk, blackboard, podium 
    and the other trappings of pedagogy representing the academic community and 
    with this site in juxtaposition (juxtaposition being another futurist theater 
    strategy) with a political site represented by some kind of didactic style 
    sign system of pins, posters, and banner waving, I suggest the following: 
    imagine an ear and a mouth, imagine a poet and a performer. Imagine nothing 
    or what you want to or Senator Byrd’s filibuster and then imagine anybody 
    who might be willing to consider active protest and civil disobedience as 
    an appropriate response to the forthcoming war. Begin counting and do not 
    be afraid to play telephone or to answer the telephone if it rings when you 
    are counting.  Interruption also counts. If you do as I suggest, you will 
    find a way to direct this play and interpret this essay, and it will not be 
    identical to what you have read on this page.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Act 
    5 </b></p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Performance 
    has been considered as a way of bringing to life the many formal and conceptual 
    ideas on which the making of art is based. Live gestures have constantly been 
    used as a weapon against the conventions of established art.”  Rose Lee Goldberg 
    </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her 
    book (now in its 3rd edition) <i>Performance Art</i>, Rose Lee Goldberg begins 
    her survey of the genre with a brief discussion of the early 20th c. avant-garde. 
    Here are some of her claims:</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1) visual artists, when they have reached an impasse 
        have turned to performance as “a way of breaking down categories and indicating 
        new directions”;<br>
        2) performance has been at the forefront of the activity of breaking away 
        from “successive fields” within the history of the 20th c. avant-garde;<br>
        3) most of the early avant-garde movements tested their ideas in performance.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Goldberg 
    here infers a particular relationship between the art object and performance. 
    A wedge is made between the art object and a performative medium that either 
    breaks down categories of art or becomes a testing ground. Subsequently the 
    art object is reinstated—or at least that is her inference—and if one looks 
    at the history of performance art from an art historical perspective, that 
    narrative works to some extent. The place for performance within her discussion 
    then is a provisional place.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">An extension 
    of this would be that the performance medium become a more permanent or significant 
    testing ground—that the performance that tests ideas comes to exist as an 
    object <i>per se</i>, or that it exists more legitimately in an in-between 
    position: one that in part fulfills a provisional role, one directed toward 
    the completion of the art object—as a thing in itself, and one that in part 
    fulfills an open-ended, non-objective mobile role that is exploratory, improvisatory, 
    and that takes language as a medium as seriously as it does the other mediums 
    of innovative theater that have superseded language.</p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is not what I would have written three or four 
        days ago or a month ago, nor what I might have written today. I gave myself 
        two days to assemble the many thoughts I have had on the topic of resisting 
        type. And these are what they are as recorded on October 12, 2002, one 
        day following the senate vote and the day that my son, having turned 18, 
        has become by law required to give his name to the selective service. 
      </p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And 
    so. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">You want to know how and why I write plays when I’m 
        a what? Well, I have figured that since all writing is difficult, any 
        mode is equally available to me. This may be a ruse, but it works. Therefore, 
        I do not decide “now I am going to write a play”—well, unless I have some 
        kind of contract or invitation in advance. What I do is, I think, hmmm…there 
        are all of these postwar French writings, like those of George Perec, 
        that deal with the quotidian. Since the quotidian is a philosophical concept 
        about what philosophy can’t handle, it seems like a great point of entry 
        for a work. A gigantic space opens where anything can happen. So I open 
        a book by Graham Greene because he likes adventure <i>a l’homme </i>(the 
        exotic quotidian) and I get this passage:  “Neither the Spanish costume, 
        which is designed for a flamenco dancer, nor the elaborate headgear is 
        inconspicuous,” and I’m off and running, running circles around gesture 
        and gender and literariness (welcome into this discrete world, <i>La Quotidienne</i>) 
        and it’s all getting acted out by this kind of supplementary excitement—the 
        words are running away with the words—and when that happens, I might decide 
        it’s theater—I can hear this in live space spoken by someone, ideally 
        a cartoon figure in a human body that enjoys being a cartoon when it is 
        not rehearsing for <i>Antigone</i>, or <i>Medea</i>, or <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

      <p  CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>BIO: Carla Harryman</b>’s two experimental novels, <i>Gardener 
    of Stars</i> and <i>The Words: after Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories and 
    Jean-Paul Sartre </i>are explorations of the paradise and wastelands of utopian 
    desire. Other works include selected writings, <i>There Never Was a Rose without 
    a Thorn</i> (1995) and <i>Animal Instincts</i> (1989). Working extensively 
    in performance, and experimental theater, she has collaborated with visual 
    artists and composers. Her recent play, <i>Performing Objects Stationed in 
    the Sub World,</i> was commissioned by the Oxford-Brookes University's Poetry 
    Center Colloquium, where it was staged (2001) as a reading, later performed 
    at Zeitgeist Theater (Detroit) and the LAB in San Francisco. “Residues or 
    Revolutions of the Languages of Acker and Artaud” will appear in the critical 
    anthology, <i>Devouring Institutions: the Writing of Kathy Acker</i>. Harryman 
    teaches Women Studies, Creative Writing and Literature at Wayne State University 
    (Detroit).</p>
