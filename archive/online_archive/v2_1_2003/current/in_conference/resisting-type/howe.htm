            <P>“I have always had a weakness for donkeys.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Robert Bresson
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two 
    years ago I completed a series of short novels that I had begun thirty years 
    before.  Five of them are set in Boston; and five of them in California and 
    one takes place almost entirely in Ireland on the brink of the Second World 
    War; all of them focus on deracinated women, the youngest in Nod, the oldest 
    in Indivisible.  They add up to one body of work.  When it was done, I knew 
    it.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These 
    books were failures on the marketplace so in fact their fates mimicked the 
    fates of their subjects.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I can’t 
    say that they were experiments but chops and grabs at moments in time, attempts 
    at discovering emotional sequence—that is, the rhythm that flows between the 
    arrival of a moment and its disappearance.  They were like notes for another 
    genre.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">2.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Years 
    before I had read two books, <i>Film Form</i> and <i>Film Sense</i>, by Eisenstein, 
    and these helped me legitimize the process I was already engaged in.  In his 
    chapter on montage he determined that the tonality of a work is established 
    by a rhythmic relationship between its segments.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">He noted 
    that in music the distance of separation between intervals can be so great 
    that it leads to a collapse inside the organic body of sound.  However, its 
    irregularity usually becomes its dynamism.  Like a healthy human heartbeat, 
    which has an intrinsic irregular system, the body of an artwork gets its vitality 
    from a rhythm based in uncertainty.  (Sick hearts have a dull regular thump.)</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Eisenstein 
    believed that there is a social mission for artists—that is, the purpose of 
    any work is to “make manifest the contradictions of Being” and this way to 
    harmonize them, if only temporarily, in the single mind of the viewer/reader.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">His 
    notes on juxtaposition and composition reassured me, because I was working 
    already out of the very far and very near.  I was aware of the wasteland of 
    potential plot that lay outside the margins of my stories and the strange 
    nature of choice in the construction of a narrative.  I used to spread the 
    final draft, sheet by sheet, on floors all over the house and move them around.  
    This way an eruption of action became a self-contained section.  But of course 
    the floors and the air were bigger than all those papers.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Because 
    of the accidents of when and where I grew up, some of the first movies I saw 
    were made by Bergman, Visconti, Rossellini, Fellini and the French New Wave.  
    Janus Films were premiered at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge.  They were 
    all foreign and subtitled. Black and white and speckled with stars and radiant 
    dust.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">They 
    were the remnants of the War, barely separable from the news that was broadcast 
    in movie theaters along with the main feature, and the cartoons.  The blurry 
    subtitles, white on white, oddly selected from the conversation taking place 
    on screen, would come to me as a kind of poetry, scraps fallen from the divine 
    table of babbling tongues.  These half-understood movies were the model of 
    a contemporary fiction because the future inherent in my own stories was only 
    half-known.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Weirdly 
    I didn’t realize this.  Instead I relentlessly pursued a written fiction that 
    had as its model something foreign, half-expressed and highly visual, without 
    ever asking:  Is this an outline for a movie?  Do I have to make the movie 
    if I have just written it?</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My novels 
    were failures undoubtedly because they were not novels.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Conventional 
    (and wonderful) narrative that knows where it is going is like a farmer setting 
    out for the daily tread.  It is a form of lifting and carrying to a pre-determined 
    destination.  My kind of story always had an uncertain goal, and it discovered 
    itself only by shedding what it already knew.  It ran without memory.  No 
    one learned from experience.  In this sense each book was seeking a state 
    of innocence.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">3.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    barn door creaks on its hinges.  A prolonged rasping like the one you hear 
    in working machinery.  It is as if the use it is being put to is giving it 
    a taste of suffering.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The 
    depressive sound of a buzz-saw or an electric lawn mower.  A refrigerator 
    groaning at night.  Or something like the bare winter trees forming a syntax 
    that looks like a new sheet music.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It isn’t 
    a barn door creaking after all.  It is a donkey’s mechanistic bray.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Then 
    the donkey comes out into the light and stands aside while the children play 
    nearby.  And this is the beginning of <i>Au Hasard, Balthasar</i>.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">About 
    this film the director Robert Bresson remarked in an interview: it is the 
    life of a donkey going through the same steps that you find in a human life—infancy 
    with its caresses, maturity, work, talent, the donkey who is put in a circus 
    and then some time before dying has a transcendent period, and then he does 
    die from the weight of human sins, and he carries gold to the frontiers.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Au Hasard, Balthasar</i> was one of Bresson’s last two black and 
    white films.  A luminous pallor surges out of the screen, spreads over every 
    face and form in the picture, it is the color of consciousness.  The subtitles 
    are ghostly and easily submerged in the background light.  Squalor bleeds 
    into this whiteness.  Blends.  The plot follows an erratic life-line until 
    it is swallowed in bells and pale sheep.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
    film and <i>Mouchette </i>were made in the days when the poverty of resources 
    in film-making were complicit in the stories of human poverty and petty crime.  
    There was no separation between equipment and intent.  The sudden shifts in 
    scene, the unschooled acting, and the engagement in a religious view that 
    carries despair to its last point—where an illumination occurs as a convergence 
    between chance and unexalted labor in the direction of love—have made Bresson’s 
    work one of the few examples of art as conversion.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">That 
    is, the whole movie’s message, its method, its tools function in harmony.  
    The donkey is the hero.  He is the film.  He seems as blind as chance.  Only 
    once is there a scene where the donkey is put in a circus to perform with 
    other long-suffering animals and there is an unblinking exchange of glances 
    among them.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Otherwise 
    the film is at the end what it was at the beginning—astonished.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">4.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My decision 
    to try making videos seven years before I stopped writing fiction was really 
    a desire to escape words and face the world.  First I bought a pixilated Fisher 
    Price toy camcorder that I carried all around the outdoors with me, taking 
    moving pictures of shadows, light, trees, etc.  It was a completely private 
    activity.  And it rewarded me with the adamant silence of creation in its 
    deep dream state.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I felt 
    as if I was carrying a baby on my arm, a baby that was accumulating know-how 
    and so I bought a heavier camcorder, a Sony, and took loads of pictures to 
    store up for later use.  A filmmaker friend began leading me around showing 
    me how to use a super 8 camera and after awhile he and I together made a picture 
    called <i>What Nobody Saw</i>.  We had actors, we had a script, and we all 
    roamed around together inventing according to our surroundings. The open-endedness 
    of the process was pleasurable to me.  Anything that happened only did so 
    because it could. </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without 
    words, the passage of birds, boats, buses, bags and planes stood in for words.  
    As far as the eye could see, a logic was returned.  But it wasn’t the logic 
    of plot or premise.  It was truly a combination of pre-determined relations 
    and chance encounters.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Simone 
    Weil once remarked, “The beings I love are creatures.  They are born by chance.”  
    It is this relationship to chance that seemed to me profound and pronounced 
    in filming.  It was a liberation from the backward-tendence of writing and 
    rewriting.  On film a donkey is just a donkey.  Even if the fur on its back 
    forms a Cross, it exists in time, is used up by time and labor, and lives 
    in blind subjugation to its fate.  It does not carry a necessary set of premises 
    and arguments along with it.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Sentences 
    and plots for a time seemed dangerous to me, an extension of closed potential, 
    of socialization.  My impulsiveness seemed to fizzle through excess scheming 
    as the life of a nation does.  When I had a chance to break free, the laws 
    of grammar restrained me.  Unfulfilled gestures and cries were excluded from 
    this ”government of words.”  It was what did NOT happen that haunted me in 
    writing, the way the air is more solid than anything in it.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Work 
    that could exist in and emerge from uncertainty, as some music does, seemed 
    both more daring and more realistic than literature.  It was like Eisenstein’s 
    commitment to the intervals and separations that create form.  The blindness 
    that loads our days seemed to have a better chance of being grasped if it 
    could, ironically, and without irony, be seen.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So I 
    made some more short videos and am about to begin working again with my old 
    pixilated camera whose batteries don’t work.  I will be trapped by the need 
    for a plug, a wall and a light from a window.  I will play it back and see 
    myriad unnoticed shadows, shapes and gestures from people who happen to pass 
    by.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this way I will be limited to chance and liberated 
        by it.  I believe this is the exact paradox that I am chasing, and always 
        was.</p>
