<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Kathleen Fraser</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This 
    panel was conceived from purely selfish motives.  As a practicing poet for 
    many years, I’ve turned, at different times in my life, to the pursuit of 
    painting, lithography and collage when the language of poetry and its alluring 
    propositions of organization have seemed unavailable or no longer adequate.  
    This errant shift away from the more familiar terrain of written language 
    forms has afforded me—with each departure—that double-edged event of entering 
    into the sheer physicality of the visual world, as well as coming up against 
    its formally-constructed givens.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Allowing 
    oneself—in each instance of departure—to take on a less known, unmastered 
    creative activity can be gratifying and frustrating.  But, in my case at least, 
    it has also brought me back to the abandoned materials of a too familiar writing 
    practice, with heightened curiosity and appetite for reconfiguring that earlier 
    language—investing it with structural ideas I’d assigned exclusively to the 
    visual arts.</p>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At 
    last year’s MSA, Susan McCabe spoke of Elizabeth Bishop’s <i>frottage  </i>technique—involving 
    a tracing and overlay of language fragments akin to the <i>frottage  </i>technique 
    used by Max Ernst —basically “rubbing a pencil on paper over objects in order 
    to defamiliarize them from their ordinary denotation.”  McCabe linked Bishop’s 
    method, in her poem “A Weed,” to Max Ernst’s earlier use of the <i>frottage</i>  
    technique in a small group of prints he entitled <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>.  
    During this discussion, I remembered how right it had seemed to discover in 
    Helen Vendler’s piece on Bishop—published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, years 
    earlier—Bishop’s hands-on engagement with painting.  </p>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Scanning 
    my peers, a subculture of genre-departure quickly emerged: poet Barbara Guest 
    turning to the novel with <i>Seeking Air</i>  and her abstract collages and 
    word-painting collaborations, achieved together with painter-friend in their 
    lofts;  poet Clark Coolidge’s comments in a letter, about his parallel practice 
    as a jazz drummer, composing poetry with sound-tracks of  be-bop streaming 
    through his headphones; Norma Cole’s original presence as a painter, shifting—in 
    what seemed like a sudden and absolute departure—to poetry and word collage, 
    as well as translation; and poet Kenwood Elmslie’s cautionary comments re. 
    the precise rigors of writing for musical theatre, how even the most contemporary 
    composers of opera were required to adhere to the conventions demanded of 
    opera <i>libretti</i>… and, subsequently, how his playful, texture-rich collages 
    and postcards turned away from that. </p>
 <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 
    the company of these writers, I’ve become more and more intrigued by the commute 
    between a perhaps more stable or identified writing practice and the departure 
    from that norm.  What happens, I wondered, when the at-first barely acknowledged 
    foreign intrigue becomes a site of equally compelling activity?</p>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Wanting 
    to hear this question discussed by my own contemporaries, I invited three 
    writers to investigate their relationships to related questions of travel 
    among artistic disciplines and to explore here today what impact that detour 
    or expansion has had on each of their working lives as writer-artists.  How 
    does one genre activity feed and question an/other?  What may  be the unsettling 
    effects and reconfigurations of risk, lure and problem-solving for the writer 
    whose genre-identity has been constructed around reliable materials and working 
    procedures, but who later discovers the need to jump—or divide—into new artistic 
    territory/s as a practitioner? </p>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Our 
    panelists are Marjorie Welish—poet, painter and art critic; Carla Harryman—experimental 
    novelist, essayist and playwright/director for Poets Theatre; and Fanny Howe—poet 
    and novelist, who began, after writing at least a dozen novels and poem collections, 
    to make video-films in the Nineties.</p>
