<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Marjorie Welish</P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">
      <div class=Section1>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What is black and white and read all over?, a question 
          appropriated from a riddle, turns on the semantic confusion between 
          visual and verbal apparatus yet now may suggest that the function of 
          “read” (as in learning or reading) may inform or figure “red” (that 
          is, a color) and not necessarily because an identity finds its coherence 
          through a fixed property for which only one structure obtains: for within 
          mediums there are puns that take effect and are construed in their double 
          identity once the writer, artist, composer, architect, choreographer 
          establishes a<b> local contextual meaning within which an encoded escape 
          is possible</b>. Identity as such in jokes and play may force the issue 
          of hybrid terms and non-synonymous doubling. Identity may be hyphenated. 
          Identity may constellate through a problematic rather than through a 
          particular medium, a problematic for which differing sets of aptitudes 
          and skills concretize research process and even product. Here, then, 
          is a way of understanding how an artist doing both may readily pass 
          from one discipline to another.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The pursuit of poetry and of painting is not necessarily 
          in conflict but may well be<b> functionally synergistic, as substantially 
          productive of creative ideas as is reading to writing</b>. Or as teaching 
          or translating is to writing. In my better moments, the simultaneity 
          of functions will distribute across teaching, writing criticism, and 
          writing a poem or painting a painting, and I consider reading a functionally 
          creative enterprise—as many of us here do. But beyond the reciprocal 
          benefits that accrue with such mobilizing of functions, poetry and painting 
          may not get in each other’s way insofar as certain ideas, being non-specific 
          to either medium, may be realized in both.  Imagine the possibility 
          of, say, <b>the problematic of incommensurate orders</b> as a compositional 
          issue that may range across poetry and painting, or may be pursued in 
          poetry even as the painting be devoted to something else entirely.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Let me demonstrate by reading a couple of shorter 
          poems provoked through my teaching an immersion course in Wallace Stevens’s 
          poetry and poetics (to be found in my book <i>The Annotated “Here” and 
          Selected Poems</i>). For our purposes, note that ringing changes on 
          a theme—the theme of place—in the first instance, distributes in an 
          all-over structure constituted of discrepant doubling; then, in the 
          second instance, distributes a heterogeneity of sentence types to push 
          into the foreground the semantic heterogeneity of a theme. The logic 
          here will be the logics of language for which a post-structuralist querying 
          of the semantics of syntax be an abiding concern.</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <P CLASS="TITLE2">Rendering Mien</p>
        <P>Spilling mien through wilderness, this, after interval.<br>
          A mien near wilderness, an increase of mien.<br>

          Jars on the horizon, tarpaulins at hand.<br>
          A wilderness equidistant between a jar and an aspect of a jar.</p>
        <P>&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2">Thing Receiving Road</p>
        <P>1. To lose a place to or allocate a glance<br>
          2. (lost, stochastic, and/or both altitudes, of which far or deep<br>
          3. disclosure is the missing mass) is to place the place.</p>
        <P >The place setting between thing and work<br>
          “ …stimulus meaning of a very unobservational…” 45, biased the clearing<br>

        <P >“To place” is to refer to<br>

        <P >a packing crate<br>
          drying plausibly.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The ordering in this second poem is a pragmatic order that puts on display 
        not a single cohesive meaning that drives the symbol in Stevens’s poem 
        but a rough relativism: “place” occurs by way of differentiating the term 
        and letting the varieties of sense “fall where they may.”  This, at any 
        rate, what I had set out to do, having noted that the world Stevens would 
        have us acknowledge in “Anecdote of the Jar”—although not in “Thirteen 
        Ways of Looking at a Blackbird”—is a unified vision. A kind of ordering 
        of the world through phenomenological subjectivity in Stevens’s work may 
        have been the provocation but my own work takes as its subject epistemologies 
        that construct a world, over which neither poetry nor painting have exclusive 
        rights.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Switching to painting for the moment, let me demonstrate how similar 
        thought might work in another medium and on its own terms. A painting 
        from the mid 1990s will serve this purpose by showing the heterogeneity 
        of orders packed with as much reference to the literature of art history 
        and theory as does the second of the two poems I just read to its own 
        literature.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <P><i>Small Higher Valley # 9</i>, 1994-5. A montage 
          is a formal device with which poets and painters a century after Cubism 
          are well familiar. For some this is a modern work in the sense that 
          it being a device of devices foregrounds the literariness of reflexivity 
          wherein the grid abruptly reconfigures itself from checkerboard series 
          to disequilibrium and topological slippage—all this across a blank passage… 
          at once a sky, a void and an aporia.  For some the incommensurate orders 
          secreted on the surface, however, express a compositional relativism 
          more akin to post-structural disenfranchisement from unity, and also 
          a post-modern historical and referential gloss on an assumed modern 
          visual priority. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1997, I was asked to be a “line-item” in an institutional grant application 
        to the Trust for Mutual Understanding, which sponsors cultural reciprocity 
        between comparable institutions in America and countries of Eastern yet 
        also Central Europe. Prior to that grant I had given myself a visual template 
        for an epistemological problematic that then became a deliberate project 
        while I lived in Lodz, Poland for six weeks. Reading now from the grant 
        application, I focused on the <b>problematic of incommensurate orders</b> 
        in the following way:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <P>[THE WITHOUT, #1] the project concerns composing 
          works whose difference in structure is that between a red, yellow, and 
          blue passage confronting a passage in black and white—a dramatic difference 
          if there ever one, given that, the two-color “systems” hold their ground 
          against three-color “systems” and do not readily submit to the other.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Incommensurate logics brought into equilibrium are 
        of great interest to me, in part to further the concerns of modern abstraction 
        by opening the givens of modernism to post-structuralist investigations.  
        Last year I took the opportunity to show a triplet of paintings from what 
        developed after this grant. </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">  To allow for the problematic of Difference-within-Similarity 
        to be much more pronounced—indeed, made radical—from canvas to canvas, 
        this series enables local contextual situations to establish the linguistic 
        rules, rules then exercised for their potential: rules established meanwhile 
        to show how a non-verbal set may act as an interpretant—in Peirce’s term—for 
        an individual member of the set. The series THE WITHOUT constitutes an 
        open work for an open investigation. Related canvases shown at the Baumgartner 
        Gallery in New York brought about my current gallery affiliation.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>How does passing from poetry to painting and back again foreground 
        new questions?</b>  Or, put in other words, how is black and white read…, 
        then reread?  My earlier point centers on the question: how do forms of 
        thought inform poetry, inform painting?  Having said at the outset that 
        the choice of medium does not necessarily drive the conception is another 
        way of saying that certain concerns are not specific to a single medium.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Questions raised include: what is a visual idea?  How may a painting 
        be said to think? Issues of medium mandate that paintings (and visual 
        art in general) not be subject to illustrating poetry.  Much painting 
        one sees is literary in this weak sense—which is why Freud rejected much 
        visual surrealism as off-the-mark and Breton seized happily on Arshile 
        Gorky’s abstract paintings as having understood the principle of metamorphosis 
        better than had many surrealists. (Much art one sees published in literary 
        journals, by the way, is less visually sophisticated on this matter than 
        ought to be given the claims for the poetics.  This topic—on which I have 
        lectured elsewhere—deserves a full discussion beyond the assertion I have 
        just made. I shall however further say by way of explanation for this 
        disjunction between visual and verbal literacy in forms that would conjoin 
        them is that this discrepant literacy is so in large measure because those 
        of us who are sighted mistakenly assume that visual literacy is a natural 
        function—that anyone who can see can read for understanding.)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>How may a painting be said to think?</b>  Whether or not Hubert Damisch 
        articulates it, the strategic model has indeed long informed the narratives 
        contesting for cultural hegemony. The strategic model is in play whenever 
        the problematic takes the form of “What is the legacy of Jackson Pollock?” 
        for the question presupposes that creating art is not historical happenstance 
        but purposive theory that manifests itself through spatial paradigms, 
        at least, this assumption of spatiality as consonant with a mental conception 
        still may be seen presupposed in the writings of Allan Kaprow’s contemplating 
        the problematic left us by Pollock, as much as by Barnett Newman’s trying 
        to take stock of the same modern narrative. Today, architecture much more 
        than painting sustains a strategic model, through the on-going theoretical 
        dialogue with ideas of tectonics warped through language or as a nexus 
        of social forces and defines its significance as such.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These days, too, poetics writes poetry and informs it with strategic 
        high stakes. So passing from one practice to another may indeed make one 
        aware of the incommensurate nature of the discourse wherein theories of 
        art and literature do not translate one to the other. Then, too, the state 
        of the art is more readily discerned once construed as a thought form, 
        but as a mode of thought in a cultural world largely indifferent to poetry 
        and indulgent of painting yet without valuing either.  </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Even as exclusive privilege to form is less and less at issue, questions 
        of medium do emerge</b>. Passing from one discipline to another does foreground 
        assumptions, practical as well as theoretical, and shows these to be decisions 
        open to question. Shuttling between home and studio does at some point 
        raise the question of choice of medium. Why paint?  This question often 
        put to me means: Why paint at all, what is the justification for this 
        obsolete technology?  Although discussing this question as with the question 
        what does it mean for painting to think? leads us to much beyond the time 
        constraints of this panel, an answer to this not specifically tied to 
        my own practice is: Why paint? Why write?   Meaning: given that so many 
        implements of writing have also become obsolete—the most recent of which 
        being the typewriter—<b>do thought forms lose their cogence once their 
        period becomes marked as happening in the past?</b>  The technology of 
        the typewriter having merged with that of computing, however, suggests 
        that writing itself, while transmuted, is still integral to creative practice. 
        Moreover, materials and techniques associated with painting may encode 
        a sort of critique of painting: indeed my diagrammatic painting is becoming—if 
        anything—more so, in order to sharpen the metalanguage.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What is it for painting to think?  might address technology in this way: 
        <b>what technics are required of this thought form to accomplish thus-and-so 
        rhetoric</b>?  Phrased in this way, the key term is not technology so 
        much as reasoning with the medium to plot a certain thought. Under the 
        aegis of this process of stating and restating the problematic several 
        strong solutions will emerge as worthily effective.  This latter is expressive 
        of the principle of<b> indeterminacy in action, where indeterminacy means 
        “degrees of freedom within a system.”</b> Modernist studies is long familiar 
        with this question: the question is that of interpretation where once 
        explanation had had the upper hand. (Postmodernist studies, meanwhile, 
        recognizes the problematic of incommensurate epistemologies as its own.)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Discourse theory and questions of institutional framing 
        of practices may emerge, then, as one passes from working in one discipline 
        to another.</p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>BIO: Marjorie Welish </b>teaches as an Associated 
        Professor in the graduate Fine arts program at the Pratt Institute, with 
        guest semesters at Brown in the fields of art criticism and literature.  
        Her most recent collection of poems, <i>The Annotated Here,</i> came out 
        in 2002 from Coffee House Press.  Welish’s writing as an art critic is 
        most admirably represented by <i>Signifying Art: Essays on Art after 1960 
        </i>(Cambridge University Press, 1999); and her paintings have been exhibited 
        in NYC over the last decade, most recently by the Baumgartner Gallery.  
        Perhaps the most eloquent homage to the multiple claims of her fiercely 
        attentive eye and ear was the recent day-long conference at University 
        of Pennsylvania in April 2002, addressing Welish’s multi-genre writing/painting 
        production via live and long-distance responses from a multitude of critics 
        and writers, from coast to coast.  These critical appreciations have been 
        collected and will soon be available in print from Slought Press.  <i>Kathleen
