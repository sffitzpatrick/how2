      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This essay is part of a project to tease out what 
        Bonnie Kime Scott has called “a tangled mesh of modernists,” and to trace 
        some of the networks of female modernists based in London at the start 
        of the twentieth century, for (as Scott says), “women writers took a great 
        deal of interest in one another.” <A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> 
        The lines of interest connecting female writers,  editors, thinkers and 
        facilitators, were also lines of energy and creative endeavour; these 
        energies and initiatives formed the grid which supported Anglo-American 
        modernism in Europe in the ’teens and ’twenties of the twentieth century.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The four women with whom I am especially concerned 
        —May Sinclair, Charlotte Mew, Hilda Doolittle Aldington and Alida Klemantaski—were 
        all based in London during the 1914-18 War. </p>

      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Moreover, they were associated with two significant 
        sites of English modernism, both physically located close to the British 
        Museum: the Poetry Bookshop, established by Harold Monro in 1913, and 
        the <i>Egoist </i>magazine, edited by Harriet Shaw Weaver from 1914 to 
        1919. <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a>They therefore represent 
        what Gillian Hanscombe and Virginia Smyers have called “another Bloomsbury,” 
        paralleling that of the more affluent artists and intellectuals grouped 
        around Vanessa Bell and her sister Virginia Woolf:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>[T]here is another “group” or, more accurately, a loose network, who 
          are less well known but who were women living and writing between the 
          1890s and the Second World War. Unlike Virginia Woolf’s set, these women, 
          who knew each other, or each other’s work, or both, were often expatriate; 
          many were poor; all were more bohemian than bourgeois; and they were 
          more linked by shared choices and interests than by the tighter ties 
          of traditional background and common blood. Nor were all the women poets 
          or novelists; some were editors and publishers, others ran bookshops, 
          yet others provided patronage of both spiritual and material kinds. 
          <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To foreground these women is to turn inside-out the 
        envelope of canonical male modernists, whom W.B. Yeats called the “Men 
        of 1914”: Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Percy Wyndham Lewis and Richard Aldington. 
      </p>

      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Most of these men had vital and even intimate links 
        with the group I shall call the “Women of 1916,” not to speak of a certain 
        rivalry. When Catherine Dawson Scott, subsequent founder of the International 
        P.E.N. club, <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a> and a friend of May 
        Sinclair, met Pound and Aldington in the spring of 1913, not long before 
        Aldington’s marriage to Hilda Doolittle and the take over of the <i>New 
        Freewoman/Egoist</i> by these self-styled “men of letters,” she put them 
        down as “choosy young gents.” <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a> 
        In 1916, Aldington was younger than both Pound and H.D. and nearly thirty 
        years Sinclair’s junior, yet he patronised the older woman, remarking 
        to a friend in 1916: “Little May is very sweet, and seems to understand 
        in a way.” <A HREF="#_edn6"NAME="_ednref6">[6]</a> Similarly, when the 
        young Eliot became literary editor of the <i>Egoist</i> in 1917, he described 
        the owner and editor Harriet Shaw Weaver, and his predecessor Hilda Doolittle, 
        as “Miss Weaver, a funny little spinster, and Mrs Aldington, better known 
        as ‘H.D.,’ a poetess”: the belittling adjectives and feminine nouns expose 
        the patronising attitude of dominant males. <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Pound, for his part, championed a “virile art,” exemplified 
        by the sculptures of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and asserted in the pages of 
        <i>BLAST</i>. <A HREF="#_edn8"NAME="_ednref8">[8]</a> At the same time, 
        he excoriated as “Amygism” the Imagist movement in whose leadership he 
        had been supplanted by Amy Lowell and whose outstanding practitioner was 
        H.D. Gender was already firmly on the men’s agenda and not introduced 
        into current discourse by the women emerging into public life and agitating 
        for political rights at this time. In the first two decades of the twentieth 
        century, when the struggle for female suffrage and the Great War coincided, 
        the dominant culture in England was authoritarian, pragmatic and militaristic. 
        By contrast, the culture promoted by the Women of 1916 was humanistic, 
        idealist and often pacifist; in a review of Yeats’s <i>Responsibilities 
        and Other Poems</i> (1914), H.D. criticized contemporary geometric art 
        as a betrayal of late Romantic values and blamed the men of her generation 
        for helping to bring about the “world calamity” of modern warfare:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p style="text-align:justify">Our generation did not stand against the 
          enemy—it <i>was</i> the enemy…. For it has merged into this struggle 
          with its own much lauded guns and aeroplanes…. The guns they praised, 
          the beauty of the machines they loved, are no more as a god set apart 
          for worship but a devil over whom neither they nor we have any more 
          control. <A HREF="#_edn9"NAME="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">H.D. was not alone in associating her art with that 
        of the nineteenth-century Aesthetes, rather than the men of her own generation. 
        Both May Sinclair and Charlotte Mew came to womanhood in the 1890s, when 
        Mew’s first published story appeared in the <i>Yellow Book</i>. <A HREF="#_edn10"NAME="_ednref10">[10]</a> 
        Elaine Showalter includes Mew, at least, among her “Daughters of Decadence,” 
        while she associates Sinclair with “Psychiatric Modernism” because of 
        her pioneering work with the Medico-Psychological Clinic in Bloomsbury’s 
        Brunswick Square. <A HREF="#_edn11"NAME="_ednref11">[11]</a>] Sinclair’s 
        latest biographer Suzanne Raitt, documenting her work as an idealist philosopher 
        and as an active feminist, identifies her as a “Modern Victorian.” <A HREF="#_edn12"NAME="_ednref12">[12]</a> 
        Her modernity is evident in her ability to see across national boundaries. 
        Well-known as a novelist on both sides of the Atlantic before the Great 
        War, Sinclair was a key contact for Americans new to London. These included 
        Ezra Pound, who arrived via Venice in 1909; Harriet Monroe, editor of 
        <i>Poetry</i>, who visited from Chicago in 1910; and Hilda Doolittle who 
        came from Philadelphia in 1911 and remained in Europe until her death, 
        fifty years later. </p>
      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
        <tr> 
          <td><b><img src="../images/collecott3.jpg" width="610" height="443"></b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> In 1913, Harriet Monroe would publish in the first 
        volume of <i>Poetry</i> the first poems of “H.D. Imagiste” to appear in 
        print, sent from London to Chicago by her foreign editor, Ezra Pound. 
        Not long after, Sinclair championed H.D.’s poetry in pages of the <i>Egoist</i>, 
        explaining to Mew that she was defending the younger writer from a “rather 
        spiteful” attack by the conservative Harold Monro. <A HREF="#_edn13"NAME="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">H.D.’s own connections confirm the impression that 
        women’s interest in, and support of, each other was international—or, 
        at least, transatlantic. Revisiting America after the War with the British 
        poet Bryher, she would see two “singing sisters”: Amy Lowell in Boston 
        and Marianne Moore in New York City. <A HREF="#_edn14"NAME="_ednref14">[14]</a> 
        Between 1914 and 1917, H.D. had worked closely with Lowell on the Imagist 
        anthologies, networking with other contributors in Britain in a deliberately 
        democratic way. <A HREF="#_edn15"NAME="_ednref15">[15]</a> This collaboration 
        challenged Pound’s editorial practice and set an example for transatlantic 
        little magazines such as the <i>Little Review</i> (started in Chicago 
        in 1914, but published in Paris throughout the 1920s). It was through 
        Lowell that H.D.’s telling first volume of poems, <i>Sea Garden</i>, came 
        out from her own London publisher Constable in 1916. <A HREF="#_edn16"NAME="_ednref16">[16]</a> 
        Moore, like Doolittle, was an alumna of Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania; 
        her poems were first published in the <i>Egoist</i> under Richard Aldington’s 
        editorship in 1915. Six years later, in 1921, Moore’s first volume Poems 
        appeared in London from Harriet Weaver’s Egoist Press, at the instigation 
        of Bryher and H.D. By then, Moore was editor of the New York <i>Dial</i>, 
        publishing not only Eliot and Pound, D.H. Lawrence and May Sinclair, but 
        also Djuna Barnes, H.D., and Mina Loy, most of whom would be expatriates 
        in Europe during the nineteen-twenties.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1916, when Aldington joined the army, H.D. took 
        over his editorship of the literary pages of the <i>Egoist</i>, handing 
        them over to Eliot the following year, as we have seen. At that time, 
        her home was a room on the edge of Bloomsbury at 44 Mecklenburgh Square, 
        within walking distance of the <i>Egoist </i>offices and the British Museum 
        Reading Room, where both Marxism and Imagism were brought to birth. </p>
      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
        <tr> 
          <td><center>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Charlotte Mew had been born on Mecklenburgh Square 
        nearly fifty years before and the Woolfs would later run the Hogarth Press 
        from number 37, on the same terrace as number 44, until it was bombed 
        during the Second World War. <A HREF="#_edn17"NAME="_ednref17">[17]</a> 
        Late in 1917, H.D. lent her room there to the Lawrences, who had been 
        expelled from Cornwall on suspicion of spying for the Germans: it was 
        here that D.H. Lawrence corrected the proofs of <i>Women in Love</i> and 
        began to write <i>Aaron’s Rod</i>. Chapter Seven of that novel takes place 
        in “The Dark Square Garden”: “it all seemed so sinister,” Lawrence wrote, 
        “this dark, bristling heart of London”—and, perhaps recalling the coast 
        of Cornwall, he describes the way “[the] houses of the Square rose like 
        a cliff on an inner dark, sea,” while the wind “boomed and tore like waves 
        ripping a shingle beach.” <A HREF="#_edn18"NAME="_ednref18">[18]</a> In 
        <i>Aaron’s Rod</i>, the Aldingtons feature as Julia and Robert Cunningham: 
        a “half-bohemian” American writer married to “a stoutish young Englishman 
        in khaki.” <A HREF="#_edn19"NAME="_ednref19">[19]</a> In <i>Bid Me to 
        Live</i>, H.D.’s later fictionalisation of the same period, <A HREF="#_edn20"NAME="_ednref20">[20]</a> 
        she and her husband feature as Julia and Rafe Ashton—poets whose marriage 
        is, in the words of one critic, a “private war between the sexes,” <A HREF="#_edn21"NAME="_ednref21">[21]</a> 
        while Lawrence appears as the charismatic Federico. Like Ashton/Aldington, 
        Federico/Lorenzo cannot resist attempting to control the writing of Julia/Hilda. 
        <A HREF="#_edn22"NAME="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In fact, 1916-1917 was H.D.’s <i>annus mirabilis</i>, 
        when she was free from male control and could publish what she pleased. 
        That year saw her emergence from Imagism and the appearance in the <i>Egoist</i> 
        of ground-breaking longer poems like “Eurydice,” of which Pound disapproved. 
        <A HREF="#_edn23"NAME="_ednref23">[23]</a> So did Aldington and Lawrence, 
        on the suggestive evidence of <i>Bid Me to Live</i>, where Rafe tells 
        his wife to “boil” a poem down to “about a quarter of the length,” and 
        Rico reproaches Julia for attempting to impersonate both Orpheus and Eurydice 
        in a new poetic sequence, and advises her to “[s]tick to the woman speaking.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn24"NAME="_ednref24">[24]</a> As a vivid dramatisation of 
        Eurydice’s last speech to Orpheus, this poetic monologue thrilled May 
        Sinclair, who described it as “the challenge of the self-delivered, defiant 
        soul sent up out of hell.” <A HREF="#_edn25"NAME="_ednref25">[25]</a> 
        “Eurydice” not only challenges the minimalist aesthetic of Imagism, but 
        represents what Rachel DuPlessis has identified as a “struggle for cultural 
        authority” analogous to feminists’ contemporary struggle for a political 
        voice, which was being acted out on a personal level between this woman 
        writer and the men around her. <A HREF="#_edn26"NAME="_ednref26">[26]</a> 
        Like the heroic voice that H.D. would invent for Helen of Troy in her 
        late epic poem “Helen in Egypt,” Eurydice’s defiant speech to Orpheus 
        ruptures centuries of male myth-making, feminine muteness and literary 
        decorum:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>my hell is no worse than yours<br>
          though you pass among the flowers and speak<br>
          with the spirits above earth.<br>
          … my spirit with its loss</p>
        <p>knows this;<br>
          though small against the black,<br>
          small against the formless rocks;<br>
          hell must break before I am lost;<br>
          before I am lost,</p>
        <p>hell must open like a red rose<br>
          for the dead to pass. <A HREF="#_edn27"NAME="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A cursory comparison between Eurydice’s role as the speaking subject in 
        this poem and Yeats’s representation of Maud Gonne as a second Helen of 
        Troy (“A girl arose that had red mournful lips…”) suggests that, as early 
        as 1917, Hilda Doolittle was preparing the ground for what Adrienne Rich 
        in 1971 called, “the courage… to use the pronoun ‘I’.” <A HREF="#_edn28"NAME="_ednref28">[28]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">During her year at the <i>Egoist</i>, H.D. published 
        only three reviews: of Marianne Moore, Amy Lowell and Charlotte Mew. This 
        foregrounding of women poets was more than a generous gesture or payback 
        for support received: it seems to have been a conscious attempt to present 
        the magazine’s readers with a body of writing by modernist women to compare 
        with that of modernist men. In her review of Mew, in particular, H.D. 
        issued a challenge to her male colleagues; pointedly celebrating Mew’s 
        achievement in the “dramatic lyric,” a genre she inherited from Browning. 
        H.D. wrote: “she alone of our generation… has succeeded in this form.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn29"NAME="_ednref29">[29]</a> As soon as Eliot had taken 
        over the editorship, he published a riposte from Pound in the form of 
        a review of his own first volume, <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i> 
        (1917). Sidelining H.D.’s remarks on Mew, Pound reasserted the male line 
        with the words: “Mr. Eliot has made an advance on Mr Browning. He has 
        also made his dramatis personae contemporary and convincing.” <A HREF="#_edn30"NAME="_ednref30">[30]</a> 
        That put the “poetesses” in their place for half a century or so until, 
        assisted by feminist scholarship, “Shakespeare’s sister” dared to be born. 
        <A HREF="#_edn31"NAME="_ednref31">[31]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alida Klemantaski was born and bred a Londoner, like 
        the much older Mew. Having grown up in Hampstead with her Polish family, 
        she took lodgings in Bloomsbury, living for a time in Red Lion Square, 
        where William Morris had had his workshops and which was still associated  
        with intellectual socialism. While Sinclair was campaigning for the Vote 
        on the street in the West End, Klemantaski (scarcely out of school) was 
        campaigning in the East End. </p>
      <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">

        </tr>
      </table>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These women’s experience of political activism in 
        the Suffrage struggle must have shaped their practice in the literary 
        arena; they learned how to network at ground level, to subvert existing 
        structures and convert their disempowerment as individuals into a collective 
        power base. We see a similar reconstruction of social relationships in 
        Sinclair’s work with Jessie Murray at the Medico-Psychological clinic, 
        and in Amy Lowell’s collaboration with H.D. on <i>Some Imagist Poets</i>. 
        The analogues with their writing practices have yet to be studied.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1913, when Klemantaski was twenty, she discovered 
        the newly-opened Poetry Bookshop in a Bloomsbury slum. The Bookshop was 
        created by Harold Monro, publisher of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> and editor 
        of two little reviews, <A HREF="#_edn32"NAME="_ednref32">[32]</a> as a 
        meeting-place for readers and writers of poetry and a lodging-house for 
        American artists like Joseph Epstein and Robert Frost. Despite its resemblance 
        to a down-market gentlemen’s club, the Poetry Bookshop was partly inspired 
        by the shops recently opened by the Women’s Social and Political Union 
        in their campaign for the Vote. These in their turn were modelled on the 
        new-style tea-shops run by J. S. Lyons and the Aerated Bread Company. 
        In the first decade of the twentieth-century, such shops were places that 
        mediated between the public sphere of the workplace and private, domestic 
        space; unlike male-dominated “public houses” or pubs, they were contact 
        zones which could be freely entered by women as well as men, without loss 
        of respect. <A HREF="#_edn33"NAME="_ednref33">[33]</a> Monro’s ambition 
        was to imitate the new entrepreneurs of the market-place and take poetry 
        onto the streets for people’s enjoyment.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While no chain of Poetry Bookshops was created throughout 
        the country, two women following Monro’s example converted a cobblers’ 
        shop in Hull into The Poetry Shop, which flourished from 1919 to 1937. 
        <A HREF="#_edn34"NAME="_ednref34">[34]</a> Also in 1919, Sylvia Beach, 
        returning to Europe from America after the War, visited London en route 
        to Paris to set up shop near the Sorbonne under the sign of Shakespeare 
        &amp; Company. </p>

      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Modelled on the Poetry Bookshop, this is best known 
        as a poste restante and even rooming-house for expatriates like Georges 
        Antheuil, Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald. As well as selling books 
        and little magazines, it was also a lending library for readers of English, 
        a place for editorial meetings and book launches. Across the street was 
        its French counterpart Les Amies du Livre, opened in 1915 by Adrienne 
        Monnier, Beach’s life-partner, and signalling women’s love of reading 
        in its very name. This did not prevent Beach and Monnier worshipping at 
        the shrine of James Joyce, whose masterpiece <i>Ulysses</i> was published 
        by Shakespeare and Company in 1922. A cartoon by Fitzgerald shows them 
        as a pair of sirens, entertaining their Transatlantic friends and praying 
        to “St. James.” Their bookshops were of course frequented by Gertrude 
        Stein and Alice Toklas; both couples were in long-term contact with H.D. 
        and Bryher, and well-known to Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, expatriate 
        editors of the <i>Little Review</i>, besides other female modernists on 
        the US/UK/Paris axis such as Djuna Barnes, Nancy Cunard, Janet Flanner 
        and Mina Loy.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Starting in March 1913, and for twenty-three years 
        thereafter, people paid a modest sum to come into the former metalworking 
        workshop behind London’s Poetry Bookshop and listen to verse being read 
        aloud. <A HREF="#_edn35"NAME="_ednref35">[35]</a> Few of these women and 
        men would have had access to the privileged pre-war Bloomsbury salons 
        of Yeats, say, or the Stephen sisters. The readings, on two nights a week 
        (Tuesdays and Thursdays), were held at 5.30 or 6 p.m. so that people could 
        drop in after work, and lasted between thirty and forty minutes. Alida, 
        now Monro’s assistant in the shop and the editorial offices above (and 
        eventually to be his “boy” wife), ran the programme and participated in 
        the live performances. So she was vital to a cultural development which 
        coincided with a dynamic shift from Victorian rules of elocution to the 
        modern art of verse speaking, then being encouraged by the newly-founded 
        Poetry Society and brought into the curriculum by London University and 
        the Royal Schools of Speech and Drama. Moreover, as a public, democratic 
        and relatively non-gender-specific space for cultural events, the Poetry 
        Bookshop anticipated the later twentieth-century concept of the communal 
        Arts Centre, hosting lectures and presentations by the philosopher T.E. 
        Hulme and the Futurist Tomaso Marinetti as well as poetry readings. <A HREF="#_edn36"NAME="_ednref36">[36]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A talented actress, like her contemporary “Rebecca 
        West” (who took her pseudonym from the Ibsen heroine she had played before 
        becoming the literary editor of the <i>New Freewoman </i>in 1913), Klemantaski 
        had a “rich, young, contralto voice.” <A HREF="#_edn37"NAME="_ednref37">[37]</a> 
        She soon gained a reputation as a performer as well as a promoter of new 
        poetry. While male poets like Pound and Monro normally read their own 
        work, only a few female poets were willing to perform in public. They 
        included Amy Lowell, Anna Wickham and Edith Sitwell. But among those who 
        preferred Alida to read their poems were H.D. and Charlotte Mew, both 
        of whom were first presented by the Poetry Bookshop in 1915. By 1916, 
        when conscription came in, Bloomsbury felt its proximity to the battlefront 
        (less than a day’s travel away for officers like Wilfred Owen and Osbert 
        Sitwell, who visited  the Bookshop when on leave from the trenches). By 
        now, Monro like Aldington was in uniform and Alida formed a firm friendship 
        with Hilda—another war-bride doing “men’s work” in wartime. Their letters 
        bear witness to this, as does their collaboration over Charlotte Mew’s 
        first volume of poetry, published like H.D.’s in 1916.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Mew, the last of our “Women of 1916,” met May Sinclair 
        at the home of a mutual friend, the brilliant theologian and yachtswoman 
        Evelyn Underhill, in the spring of 1913. Best known for her 1911 study 
        <i>Mysticism</i>, Underhill had published a volume of poems, <i>Immanence</i>, 
        in 1912. The two women were brought together by Catherine Dawson Scott, 
        a prolific writer, literary hostess and political activist for working 
        people and the women’s movement. Scott recorded in her diary: “when Charlotte 
        Mew came I persuaded her to read to us [her poem] ‘The Farmer’s Bride,’ 
        and May was so won over that she deserted me and they went away together.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn38"NAME="_ednref38">[38]</a> Though known to her friends 
        as “Sappho” because of her long poem of that name, Scott was shocked to 
        discover that Charlotte was not only a genius but a pervert: “are all 
        geniuses perverts?” she asked herself, and Mew responded by referring 
        to Scott (who was married to a doctor) as “Mrs Sappho”—which chimes with 
        Amy Lowell’s insistence that Sappho was “Sapho [sic]—not Miss or Mrs.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn39"NAME="_ednref39">[39]</a> In her richly documented biography 
        of Sinclair, Suzanne Raitt sums up the evidence for and against Sinclair 
        having been “bothered” by Mew (as Scott so nicely put it), and notes that 
        “[i]ronically it was this ‘late Victorian’ who confronted Sinclair with 
        the limits of her own modernity by revealing her love to her.” <A HREF="#_edn40"NAME="_ednref40">[40]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Mew was in her late forties, with a career in short 
        fiction behind her, when she began to be recognised as a poet. She lived 
        with her mother and sister at 9 Gordon Street, close to 46 Gordon Square, 
        the first Bloomsbury home of Vanessa, Virginia and Thoby Stephen. In May 
        1915 Sinclair invited Mew, Underhill and the Aldingtons to dinner with 
        the no doubt intended result of Mew’s publication in the poetry pages 
        of the <i>Egoist</i>. <A HREF="#_edn41"NAME="_ednref41">[41]</a> Almost 
        simultaneously, Alida Klemantaski came across another poem in the <i>Nation</i>, 
        sought Mew out, featured her work at a Poetry Bookshop reading that Mew 
        attended and, with the support of Sinclair and H.D., persuaded Harold 
        Monro to publish the volume that appeared in 1916 as <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i>.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her memoir of Mew, Alida Monro (as she then called 
        herself) recalled two problems with the production of this book. The first 
        was that the only compositor employed by the firm of printers used by 
        the Poetry Bookshop was a Methodist who found blasphemy in it and refused 
        to type-set it: “We were forced,” says Alida, “to employ a larger printer 
        the other side of the river, whose compositors were not assailed by religious 
        scruples.” <A HREF="#_edn42"NAME="_ednref42">[42]</a> (She seems to imply 
        that morals were looser on the South bank of the Thames, as in Shakespeare’s 
        day.) This episode anticipates in little the scandal of Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i>, 
        which met objections from printers in London and New York and was eventually 
        published by Sylvia Beach on the Left Bank of the Seine. <A HREF="#_edn43"NAME="_ednref43">[43]</a> 
        The second problem with <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i> was that Mew’s poetic 
        lines were often (as she admitted) “abnormal in length.” <A HREF="#_edn44"NAME="_ednref44">[44]</a> 
        Since “she did not wish to be run over,” as Alida puts it, “a rather ugly 
        quarto page had to be used.” <A HREF="#_edn45"NAME="_ednref45">[45]</a> 
        The Monros’ support for Mew’s determination to retain the spacing of her 
        handwritten original anticipates Susan Howe’s efforts on behalf of Emily 
        Dickinson. <A HREF="#_edn46"NAME="_ednref46">[46]</a> These issues about 
        the look of the poem on the page are perhaps symptomatic of female writers’ 
        need for intellectual and economic control over the production of their 
        work, as exemplified by Woolf’s experimentation with prose genres for 
        her own Hogarth Press and H.D.’s freedom to publish poems of greater length 
        as literary editor of the <i>Egoist</i> during Aldington’s absence at 
        war. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Sinclair’s comments on both poets show that she was 
        well aware of the significance of such freedoms. She praised in H.D.’s 
        poetry “the power of the clean, naked, sensuous image to carry the emotion 
        without rhyme” and admired in “Eurydice” the writer’s ability to move 
        beyond “a narrow plot, tied by her Imagism.” <A HREF="#_edn47"NAME="_ednref47">[47]</a> 
        She also celebrated, in Mew’s poetry, “depths &amp; depths of passion 
        &amp; sheer beauty” beyond the scope of most Imagists. <A HREF="#_edn48"NAME="_ednref48">[48]</a> 
        These remarks chime with Dora Marsden’s programme for “The Art of the 
        Future,” which stated that “the soul breaks into evidence as readily as 
        pain breaks into a cry,” and called on artists to represent these “movements 
        of the soul” in their work. <A HREF="#_edn49"NAME="_ednref49">[49]</a> 
        In the same spirit, Mew made the cri de coeur or “cry from the heart” 
        central to her poetic, and to her dramatisation of imagined states of 
        mind. “One has not only the cry but the gesture and the accent,” she wrote, 
        in her breathless, unpunctuated style. <A HREF="#_edn50"NAME="_ednref50">[50]</a> 
        Hence Mew’s aesthetic, like Marsden’s, was diametrically opposed to Eliot’s 
        rash definition of poetry as “an escape from emotion”; <A HREF="#_edn51"NAME="_ednref51">[51]</a> 
        rather, she insisted that “the quality of emotion is the first requirement 
        of poetry.” <A HREF="#_edn52"NAME="_ednref52">[52]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Suzanne Raitt has suggested that Mew’s “emotional 
        theatre” represented for Sinclair a kind of swan-song for the decadent 
        art they had both enjoyed at the <i>fin-de-siècle</i>. <A HREF="#_edn53"NAME="_ednref53">[53]</a> 
        As we have seen, these “Women of 1916” took their cue not from the “Men 
        of 1914,” but from the late romanticism of Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats. 
        H.D.’s idea of her “real artist personality” appears to derive from Wilde’s 
        belief in the stylistic authority of the intense personality of the artist—a 
        belief diametrically opposed to Eliot’s dogma of “impersonality.” Among 
        both novelists and poets, we find an alternative aesthetic which is woman-centred 
        and emotionally engaged, refusing the terms of Eliot’s formulaic distinction 
        between “the man who suffers and the mind which creates.” <A HREF="#_edn54"NAME="_ednref54">[54]</a> 
        They esteem speech and performance as well as writing and print, and—in 
        the spirit of Wilde—cherish the human personality as well as the poet’s 
        art. In his later years, Yeats mastered the art of projecting himself 
        into other selves, dramatic characters as often female as male. Mew called 
        this “impersonation,” and she impersonates men as well as women in the 
        poems of <i>The Farmer’s Bride</i>, presenting a Browning-esque alternative 
        to the “impersonality” sought by the Men of 1914. <A HREF="#_edn55"NAME="_ednref55">[55]</a> 
        Moreover, while Eliot and Pound valued the written rather than the spoken 
        word, the Anglo-Irish tradition of Wilde and Yeats placed a premium on 
        the human voice: for them, in the words of Jacques Derrida, “the voice 
        is consciousness.” <A HREF="#_edn56"NAME="_ednref56">[56]</a> So it was 
        for H.D. and Mew, in their appropriation of the dramatic lyric. Already 
        experienced in minimalizing the verse monologue in poems like “Oread,” 
        H.D. chose for her translation of Euripides’ <i>Ion</i>, begun in 1916, 
        a “broken, exclamatory or evocative vers-libre.” <A HREF="#_edn57"NAME="_ednref57">[57]</a> 
        This resonates with Sinclair’s description of Mew’s “broken, dramatic 
        manner” of voicing her poetry. <A HREF="#_edn58"NAME="_ednref58">[58]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Despite her reluctance to perform in public, Mew 
        believed that the best vehicle of felt experience is the human voice: 
        “All verse gains by being spoken, and mine particularly,” she told Dawson 
        Scott. <A HREF="#_edn59"NAME="_ednref59">[59]</a> Sinclair endorsed this, 
        writing to Scott that Mew’s poetry “absolutely needed her voice, her face, 
        her intonation and vehemence, to make it carry.” <A HREF="#_edn60"NAME="_ednref60">[60]</a> 
        Drawing on Scott’s diaries for 1913, Penelope Fitzgerald comments that, 
        when reading:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Charlotte seemed possessed, and seemed not so much to be acting or 
          reciting as a medium’s body taken over by a distinct personality. She 
          made slight gestures and used strange intonations at times, tones that 
          were not in her usual speaking range…. At the end, Charlotte gave a 
          characteristic toss of the head. <A HREF="#_edn61"NAME="_ednref61">[61]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like Sinclair, Scott and Underhill were intensely 
        moved by Mew’s private readings for her female friends; Scott says she 
        had to pinch herself to keep back the tears, and Underhill felt as though 
        she were “having whisky with my tea.” <A HREF="#_edn62"NAME="_ednref62">[62]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Unlike the public events at the Poetry Bookshop, 
        these readings took place in the private space of the Dawson Scotts’ home. 
        Half-an-hour’s train journey from Paddington Station, this suburban salon 
        was accessible from Central London and apparently frequented only by women 
        of Mrs. Scott’s acquaintance, while her doctor husband was at work in 
        his surgery. <A HREF="#_edn63"NAME="_ednref63">[63]</a> In this safe space, 
        these women flouted Edwardian etiquette and broke with the social conventions 
        as they broke into an “Art of the Future.” The venue, on the periphery 
        of literary London and well away from Bloomsbury in both ethos and ethics, 
        correlates with Celeste Schenck’s account of Mew’s “marginal modernism.” 
        <A HREF="#_edn64"NAME="_ednref64">[64]</a> Schenck goes on to ask an important 
        critical question:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>If, as Georg Lukács and feminist critics 
          have noted, the radical poetics of canonized “Modernism” often masks 
          a deeply conservative politics, might it also be true that the seemingly 
          genteel, conservative poetics of women poets such as Mew, whose worth 
          even feminists have overlooked, would pitch a more radical poetics than 
          we considered possible? <A HREF="#_edn65"NAME="_ednref65">[65]</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Reflections such as this suggest to Schenck that, 
        with the examples of Alice Meynell, Charlotte Mew and Anna Wickham before 
        us, as well as those of H.D., Gertrude Stein and Mina Loy, “we must renounce, 
        salutarily, any hope for a unitary, totalizing theory of female poetic 
        modernism.” <A HREF="#_edn66"NAME="_ednref66">[66]</a> By implication, 
        then, literary history must be re-written in a mode that admits difference—of 
        gender, of genre—and of further difference within that difference; but 
        that admission will entail the admissibility of marginal and marginalised 
        modernists such as May Sinclair and Charlotte Mew. Suzanne Raitt notes 
        Mew’s “inability to discount the body” in her reading, as if she were 
        an early twentieth-century exemplar of the French feminist injunction 
        that “Woman must put herself into the text—as into the world and into 
        history—by her own movement.” <A HREF="#_edn67"NAME="_ednref67">[67]</a> 
        That kind of movement can be traced beneath the accepted histories of 
        wartime London and beyond the binary aesthetics of literary modernism: 
        it is still vivid amongst the “Women of 1916.”</p>
