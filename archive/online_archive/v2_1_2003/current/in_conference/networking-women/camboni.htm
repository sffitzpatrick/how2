      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Marina Camboni</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Our project <i>Networking Women: Subjects, Places, 
        Links Europe-America, 1890-1939. Towards a Rewriting of Cultural History</i> 
        is yet another stream contributing to the widespread and extensive re-visioning 
        of modernism, and of turn of the nineteenth and early twentieth cultural 
        history, that has been going on for some time in almost all fields. The 
        Modernist Studies Association is certainly an outcome of this re-visionist 
        temper. Taking form at the turn of the twentieth century, “Networking 
        Women” was also our way of reactivating a dialogue with women who, like 
        us, lived in a transitional time and whose experiences we felt could be 
        of use for present as well as for future times.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For over three years, 38 researchers from different 
        Italian universities (Bari, Firenze, Macerata, Pisa, Roma, Trento, plus 
        one UK university at Durham), and from different disciplines—mostly literary 
        critics and historians, but also musicians, librarians and computing engineers—have 
        organized their work around a common thematic and theoretical core and 
        in response to a national directive that finances only research both nationally 
        and internationally relevant. In those three years, we unearthed archival 
        papers, went through letters and manuscripts, leafed through dusty magazines, 
        sometimes feeling that very few scholars or readers had brought to life 
        their pages in the intervening years. We carried to our meetings and seminars 
        our discoveries, as if we had found gold in our treasure-hunting, and 
        shared the sheer pleasure of discovery which acted as an energizer in 
        our research work.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We looked at portraits, pictures, posters, films, 
        re-read novels, poems, autobiographies we’d read a number of times before, 
        trying to detect whether—to echo H.D.’s lines—the new maps we had planned 
        to use would cover or discover yet unexplored territories. We did our 
        best to carry out a proper research—proper, I mean, in the etymological 
        sense of the word: i.e. to research, search again, and then to double 
        check both our source materials and the narratives devoted to the period 
        and to modernism.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We are now in the second phase of the “Networking 
        Women” project, the first having been completed with the conference that 
        took place in Macerata in March 2002, in tandem with the publication of 
        our website and database, and the formulation of a proposal for cultural 
        analysis based on the first two years of research. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Our project stems from two basic assumptions: both 
        are political, as well as theoretical and critical. The first one we share 
        with the Russian semiotician Yuri M. Lotman. Like Lotman we maintain that 
        the past never ends once and for all but, rather, it always creates new 
        values. Through our project we intend to contribute to the reconstruction 
        of the multiple directions that were open in actual history at the turn 
        of a century, directions just as epocal as our own turn of the millennium 
        but which, in the first half of the twentieth century, were abandoned 
        or disregarded.  We wanted to bring them once again to the attention of 
        the present. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this we differentiate our position from that of 
        Raymond Williams who, in <i>The Politics of Modernism</i>, maintains that 
        that “we must search out and counterpose (to the avant-gardist tradition) 
        an alternative tradition taken from the neglected works left in the wide 
        margin of the century, a tradition which may address itself to a modern 
        future in which community may be imagined again.” (35) We are questioning 
        the whole structure of center-margin, its closed and enclosing spatial 
        representation of relative power positions that can conceive only duality. 
        By imagining a sheaf of intertwined historical possibilities or strands, 
        by making “networking” the basis of our cultural model, we are moving 
        out of static representation and entering a plural and dynamic one. This 
        involves not only historical facts but also artistic facts and literary 
        texts, whose very meanings “are produced through complex webs of intertextual 
        relationships.” (Felski 29)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In our project we have focused on the complexity 
        of cultural dynamics and taken into consideration personal, emotional 
        and intellectual affiliations, as well as power relations. These have 
        been the starting point for our re-reading of turn-of-the-century and 
        modernist cultural history, a point-of-view that has yielded new information 
        and has been highly rewarding. Not only have we read the available documents 
        from a culturally materialistic perspective—interweaving so-called “high” 
        intellectual activities of the avant-gardes and canonical works of modernism 
        with more popular art forms and with “mass” socio-political movements 
        that characterize the period—but we’ve focused our attention, first of 
        all, on the interplay of the personal with the political and cultural. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, we’ve aimed not so much at bringing existent 
        or hidden and manifest connections to the fore, but also at questioning 
        some of these connections.  In his <i>La ProcÈdure silence</i>, Paul Virilio, 
        while pinpointing the universalizing impetus of modernist avant-gardes, 
        has shown how much an “aesthetic of disappearance” may be responsible 
        both for the modernist work of art and for the nazi concentration camps, 
        an aesthetic he maintains has shaped our present way of perceiving the 
        world and may be responsible for the continuation of a mode of destruction.  
        Cultural studies must, we believe, interrogate the negative forces of 
        modernism and assume clear ethical stances.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The second assumption of our research stems from 
        our awareness that the symbolic system that forces women’s transcendence 
        out of history and into Myth and silence—and our concomitant social, political 
        and cultural subalternity in everyday life—is still very powerfully at 
        work. As sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has shown in his recent <i>Masculine 
        Domination</i>, all power relations are rooted in the man/woman power 
        relation and the symbolic system that perpetuates it. In modern times, 
        ever since Mary Wollstonecraft’s vindication of rights, women have denounced 
        this perverse naturalization of differences. Our research work and cultural 
        analysis are rooted also in this awareness and extensive critical feminist 
        production. Taking an anti-colonialist, anti-paternalist and antifundamentalist 
        stance, Algerian writer Assia Djebar cries out, in her speech given when 
        receiving the German Publishers Peace Prize: there is a first language 
        of intellectual and moral integrity that says “no” to oppression, even 
        by using the colonizers’ language.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Thus, at the root of our research project there is 
        an ethical stance, as well as a survival strategy. To counteract the undermining 
        force at work in society we have first of all focused our research on 
        a number of women who, through their different initiatives, contributed 
        to create and support the “modern” culture that produced modernist artefacts 
        and assisted and supported the emergence of an inter-ethnic, international 
        and supra-national culture, thus strengthening the interrelations between 
        Europe and the United States, and between their metropolitan centers (London, 
        Paris,  Berlin and Vienna, New York) and their peripheries (Scotland, 
        the Southwest of the USA, the Caribbeans). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These women have been considered in their role as 
        founders of journals and publishing houses, promoters of salons and theater 
        companies, and as social activists: in synthesis, as critical junctions, 
        links, places of aggregation, of a complex network of human, political, 
        cultural and artistic relations worth exploring: Dora Marsden, Adele Butti, 
        Carlotta Kaderk Berk, Harriet Shaw Weaver, H.D., Bryher, Gertrude Stein, 
        Natalie Clifford Barney, Marie Laurencin, Germaine Brooks, Nancy Cunard, 
        Edith Craig, Margaret Anderson, Kay Boyle, Helen Diner, Frances Benjamin 
        Johnston, Gertrude Kasebier, Muriel Rukeyser, Susan Glaspell, Fortuna 
        Morpurgo Petronio, Rosa Mayreder, Elsa Asenijeff, Tillie Olsen, Meridel 
        LeSueur, Elody Oblath Stuparich, Carlotta Kadel Beck, Wanda Wultz, Anita 
        Pittoni, Willa Muir, Catherine Carswell, Rebecca West, Storm Jameson have 
        been at the starting point of our discovery process. (For a complete list 
        see our database <a
href="http://reti.unimc.it/">http://reti.unimc.it</a>).</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By making networking the central metaphor of our 
        research— together with its allied terms, “exchanges” and “crossroads”—and 
        building this concept a model for the kind of relational work that Williams 
        believed to be central to cultural theory, we were able to:</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1/ better represent the actual historical conditions 
        and roles played by many of the women whose contribution to culture we 
        wanted to investigate, but also to move beyond the very notion of decade 
        (the twenties, the thirties etc.) with its emphasis on groups and movements, 
        which notion has often been responsible for excluding women;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">2/ describe material and immaterial relations and 
        put back on the map of existence historical actors and cultural agents 
        that have been deleted from cultural histories. Human relationships, of 
        whatever nature, are relevant for human development since, as neurobiologist 
        Daniel Siegel has demonstrated, in each of us “the mind develops at the 
        interface of neurophysiological processes and interpersonal relationships” 
        (21);</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">3/ avoid segregating women and men in separate histories, 
        for three reasons:</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">a) because many of the women we selected refused 
        to be considered feminist activists or artists; b) because many women 
        and men were, by and large, involved in the same projects;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">c) because both women and men were participants in 
        the same cultural sphere;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">4/ deal with European and American Modernism, as 
        with a single complex cultural sphere, rather than as separate fields 
        of investigation, their respective value and contribution resting on the 
        continuous give-and-take between people and their languages as well as 
        between intellectual, artistic and material products;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">5/ take advantage of the relational potential offered 
        by hypertextual and hypermedia mapping and by the web, and thus follow 
        the threads connecting people, ideas, events, artworks, and little by 
        little re-construct the complexity of cultural dynamics;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">6/ through the website and database designed and 
        developed within the “Networking Women” project, as well as through our 
        seminars, to relate as researchers, sharing our findings and contributing 
        to the construction of networking paths between our women and men—the 
        other fourteen subjects around which our database is structured—and the 
        innumerable keywords that link them. The “Forum” section of our website 
        also opens our project to contributions outside the group.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Because our networking project is based on a relational 
        model of the cultural sphere as a complex system, I’d like to point out 
        the specificity of our choice of the words “relational,”  “sphere,” and 
        “complex system.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>1. Relational</b>: the adjectival form of the 
        noun relation emphasizes the dynamic tendency—with internal formations 
        moving at different speeds—and the relatedness of all elements in the 
        sphere. This relational model is better suited to represent the relevance 
        of interpersonal relationships in human development and the interaction 
        of local and global. The term relational also implies the existence of 
        relations between different domains of knowledge, as well as between different 
        experiential realities. Though the term relation may connect us to Raymond 
        Williams’ Hegelian model for cultural studies, and though we owe him much, 
        the relation he establishes to solve the opposition between art and social 
        praxis, culture and society maintains the binary Kantian opposition between 
        the two and is of limited use for our model.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>2.</b> The word <b>sphere</b>, while it is consonant 
        with Yuri M. Lotman’s semiosphere, i.e. his idea of culture as a sphere 
        of signs in which we are all immersed, moves beyond Lotman’s opposition 
        of culture to nature and non-culture articulating western man’s self-centered 
        world.<A HREF="#_edn1"NAME="_ednref1">[1]</a> For we want to emphasize 
        the continuum which makes it impossible to oppose these three terms as 
        well as the reality they refer to. In our sense, the word <b>sphere</b>, 
        because of its inclusiveness, takes into account what feminist critics 
        have been arguing for a number of years now: that it is not possible to 
        disentangle nature from culture, self from other, productive processes 
        from reproductive processes. The concept of a “cultural sphere” also widens 
        and expands the structural metaphor of “cultural field” adopted by Bourdieu, 
        and represents our consciousness of the fact that we are all—women and 
        men—set within the object that we are trying to comprehend; we have embodied 
        the historical structures of the masculine order in the form of unconscious 
        schemes of perception and appreciation. When we try to understand masculine 
        domination, we are therefore likely to resort to modes of thought that 
        are the product of “domination” (<i>Masculine Domination</i> 5). </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>3.</b> As for the third expression, <b>complex 
        system</b>, we consider culture a complex system in which dynamic tendencies—casual 
        and potentially disruptive—interact with structural and systemic organizations. 
        As a complex system, it is consistent with Lotman’s representation of 
        culture as a complex whole, with internal formations moving at different 
        speeds and sometimes simply evolving, other times exploding with no apparent 
        cause and taking a completely new course. When “the complex intertwining 
        of events causally and casually determined called ‘history’ becomes an 
        object of description first on the part of its contemporaries, and then 
        on the part of historians,” however, both descriptions tend to eliminate 
        causality from the events. This process of transformation begins when 
        some of its actors appropriate the role of codifiers and define the whole 
        present from their own perspective, a perspective which is then taken 
        by researchers and historians who “reduce what was simply synchronic into 
        a structural unity and transform a dominating description in a structural 
        unity.” <A HREF="#_edn2"NAME="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In building their narratives as a sequence of inevitable 
        causalities, historians hide the fact that the present and the “continuous 
        present”/s (per Gertrude Stein) of each historical moment were much more 
        complex and held in their bosom many more possibilities than were actually 
        developed.  As Walter Benjamin has shown, in those presents lie the latent 
        possibilities which, on the one hand, give a different depth to the actual 
        development of facts and, on the other, can be considered a potential 
        resource for our present.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Finally, in order to better represent what is actually 
        happening in a specific moment of time or in a specific situation within 
        a complex system, sub-systems can be individuated. <A HREF="#_edn3"NAME="_ednref3">[3]</a> 
        In this way the interior functioning of each sub-system can be explored, 
        together with the relations it establishes with other sub-systems, and 
        with the whole system at various levels. There are a number of assumptions 
        we all share. The first and central is: given the empirical set of elements 
        we have selected in the cultural sphere—women, journals, theaters, salons, 
        art galleries, cities, etc.—each has been considered a place/and an intersection 
        of a number of different relations.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since, moreover, each place is characterized by an 
        internal dynamism, the term “locality” as defined by Doreen Massey has 
        been adopted, rather than that of place. Though originally and exclusively 
        used by Massey to denote a geographical place, the concept of locality 
        as “construction(s) out of the intersections and interactions of concrete 
        social relations,” and as a place of “interaction” (138-39) containing 
        and partly constituted by conflict, can apply to different types of entities. 
        The term “locality,” moreover, conveys the time dimension as well as the 
        construction and interactivity of elements in each subsystem.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Each of the empirical sets of elements we have selected 
        in the cultural sphere has been considered a locality in the network and 
        a subsystem in the cultural sphere—that is, a complex unity modified by 
        time as well by construction and interactivity. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Moving on from localities and subsystems, we need 
        further to specify the types of relations that obtain between localities. 
        The topological model proposed by Michel Serres in the first of his Hermes 
        books, <i>La communication</i>, has helped find a way. Though limited 
        by the structuralist perspective in which it is set, Michel Serres’ “ìloganalyse” 
        offers a useful representation of the number of possible ways of travelling 
        between different domains and even between the different realities we 
        represent as locations in the cultural sphere. <A HREF="#_edn4"NAME="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To sum up, we have imagined a sphere of culture in 
        which our women, journals, theaters, salons, cities, etc.—that is, our 
        empirically determined ensemble of points/localities—is the set of elements 
        participating at one and the same time in more than one relational sub-system: 
        a self-referential or individual system, a local sub-system, a set of 
        sub-systems or a larger complex system like Anglo-American Modernism.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are a number of relations that obtain between 
        two or more localities, and as interpreters of these relations, we can 
        build either descriptive or interpretive paths, or links. Through these 
        paths we reconstruct and represent our understanding of these relations. 
        In all cases, there are no logically necessary steps between localities, 
        no single paths, but multiple and complex paths joining/mediating/running 
        through the locations. Paths are always the result of a choice.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We selected fifteen subjects as the largest organizing 
        subsystems of our database. Though clearly limited in number, they represent 
        our first effort to put into the cultural sphere of modernity and modernism 
        a number of localities and to join them up through interpretive and relational 
        paths that are our keywords. The subjects are:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>wo/men, gender/sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, peace, war, 
          places, displacement, internationalism/transnationalism, regionalism/localism, 
          exchanges, identity, cultural practices, arti/facts, definitions of 
          culture</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Each of the fifteen subjects is associated with a 
        keyword. We can make up to 100 associations. In this way, records with 
        identical subject or keyword are linked and both subjects and keywords 
        become connecting paths between localities.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To make this model and our work clear, I shall offer 
        a couple of examples of relations obtaining within a single sub-system, 
        and between this subsystem and related systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Locations and Paths 1: women-men</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I have chosen two locations from the women-men subsystem 
        of our database. The two are Bryher and Ezra Pound. In both cases, I’ve 
        selected the word “money,” or its equivalent, material support, as an 
        interpretive and critical path deriving from a precise selection of facts, 
        and linking each location to other localities in our cultural sphere.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I have selected Bryher for a number of objective 
        and contingent reasons, the first one being that she provides a powerful 
        model of networking woman. In one of the letters in which she planned 
        the future of <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, she explicitly cut out for 
        herself the “liaison work” with the contributors and the role of collector 
        of manuscripts, though she decided not to figure as the journal’s editor. 
        And she did connecting work all her life long, connecting people at all 
        levels. Here is an instance of how she worked. When in 1933 in Germany 
        the Nazis started to persecute the Jews and to silence opposition, Bryher’s 
        friend Pabst was blacklisted.  Besides thinking of helping him leave Germany, 
        her first idea was to launch an exiles’ paper to help him and all the 
        others with the same dilemma. When Heinrich Mann wrote asking her to help 
        him find funding to make a film out of his last book, all the while complaining 
        that living in Germany had become problematic, she wrote to everyone she 
        knew: V. Hunt, D. Richardson, Virginia Woolf and Marianne More, among 
        others. Later she would do wonderful and dangerous work helping the persecuted 
        to escape from Germany. <A HREF="#_edn5"NAME="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher played a very important role in shaping Anglo-American 
        culture and promoting some of its avant-garde figures and publications. 
        Her money was behind Robert McAlmon’s <i>Contact Editions</i>. She established 
        <i>CloseUp</i>, the journal that launched film as an art-form that could 
        join high and mass cultures. She launched <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, 
        through which she tried to build a transnational European culture capable 
        of contrasting Nazist and fascist nationalisms, while finding contributors 
        and contributions from different continents and opening up her journal 
        to a transcontinental culture.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Following the money path, I can join her to H.D., 
        Dorothy Richardson, the Sitwells, Freud and the school of psychoanalysis, 
        Kenneth Macpherson, Rober McAlmon and Horace Gregory—all of whom benefited 
        from her money—and build a European and Transatlantic subsystem. By following 
        the money path we can also build a network of relations that, though first 
        of all personal and economic, also branches out into intellectual, political 
        and artistic paths. This economic relation was in more than one case life-saving—and 
        I include H.D. in the case list.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As for Ezra Pound, this time he is considered not 
        as the impresario, or the creator of a movement or an era, but as the 
        recipient of money and support from two other women who figure in our 
        cultural map: May Sinclair and Margaret Cravens. Once again, the interpretive 
        path followed is that of money. Ezra Pound, writes Suzanne Raitt, author 
        of the most recent biography of Sinclair, “had been one of May Sinclair’s 
        protégés, and had been accepting substantial gifts from her, ever since 
        he arrived in London from the USA as an unknown writer in 1908.” (182) 
        Theophilus Boll, Sinclair’s first biographer, informs us that Pound never 
        acknowledged the material aid May Sinclair had given him. (85) Whereas 
        in <i>End to Torment</i>, H.D. recalls that in her will May Sinclair left 
        “50 or 100 pounds each, to Ezra, Richard, and (her)self, and a choice 
        of some fifty books from her library.” (10) As for the suicidal Margaret 
        Cravens, a cultivated woman from a wealthy American family, she had moved 
        to Paris in 1907 to continue her training as pianist and musician. There, 
        in March 1910, she had met Pound. “On a basis of one or two days’ acquaintance, 
        (she) offered him such a large sum of money that he was able to put everything 
        out of mind except finishing <i>The Spirit of Romance</i> and getting 
        on to new projects.” It has been calculated that her contribution “would 
        have been roughly $1,000 per year.” Since a trust arrangement allowed 
        her to get only $1.500 per year, “her assistance to Pound amounted to 
        a considerable sacrifice.” (10)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The editors of Cravens’ letters, Omar Pound and Robert 
        Spoo, believing that, though “A true, dedicated bohemian… unlike most 
        of her circle, she never enjoyed or sought more than a private reputation.” 
        (p. 3) They emphasize Cravens’ infatuation with Pound, and attribute her 
        suicide to her romantic search for fulfilment in love and marriage, thus 
        disposing of her artistic aspirations. However, we may build an interpretive 
        path that reads in Cravens’ gift of money to Pound not love—or not only 
        love—but the sign that she was trying to fulfil her desire for success 
        in the artistic world by proxy, through someone who had in himself the 
        kind of faith she did not have in herself.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bryher, Sinclair, Craven each enter a larger subsystem 
        whose localities are joined by a relation of human and economic support 
        of avant-gardist culture and of avant-gardist men. Considering this relationship 
        from the cultural point-of-view, we can use Pierre Bourdieu’s analysis 
        of the cultural and artistic field. If, as he maintains, “The work of 
        art is an object which exists as such only by virtue of the (collective) 
        belief which acknowledges it as a work of art, “a full understanding and 
        appreciation of the work of art has to take into account everything which 
        helps to constitute the work as such, not least the discourse of direct 
        or disguised celebration.” (“The Field of Cultural Production” 319)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bourdieu’s picture of the cultural field in its relations 
        to the fields of economic power and class power, may help clarify my point 
        once I integrate it within the masculine domination system. In Bourdieu’s 
        diagram within the wider field of class relations, the artistic field 
        is contained in the negative pole of the political and economic field 
        though it possesses a relative autonomy marked by the square surrounding 
        it.  However, the field of economic power occupies the upper and dominant 
        space of the field of class. No matter what political positions single 
        individuals in the cultural field take, they of necessity belong in the 
        positive pole of the field of class relations. (“The Field” 319)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If I inscribe Bourdieu’s fields within a larger frame 
        representing the sexual power system, we shall have a diagram in which 
        class, economic and artistic power relations are all located in the upper 
        and dominant pole of the field of sexual power relations.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Following once more Bourdieu and his definition of 
        cultural space as a structured field in which agents both occupy positions 
        and take positions, I can say that in the modernist cultural sphere women 
        could occupy positions in the literary or artistic field but were not 
        allowed to take their position within it as women.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This consideration makes the cases of Cravens and 
        Bryher very similar. Cravens, the well-to-do, well-educated, turn-of-the-century 
        American girl in Europe can be taken as a typical example of a woman who 
        could enter the cultural field but not take a position within it. Though 
        ambitious and desirous to make a career as a pianist, as the novelist 
        Alice Woods put it in her novel <i>Fame-Seekers</i>, she could not “own 
        the aim, even to herself.” (3-4)</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Martha Nussbaum has amply demonstrated how much “differences 
        in options construct differences in thought” and “affect the inner lives 
        of people, not just their external options: what they hope for, what they 
        love, what they fear, as well as what they are able to do.” (31) The Pound-Cravens 
        relationship reveals their respective awareness of sexualized power relations 
        within the field of culture and the clear cut division of gender spaces 
        within turn-of-the-century Euro-American culture. Bryher herself, notwithstanding 
        her economic power, can be taken as a clear case of powerlessness in the 
        cultural field as a woman and a writer.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But, if we look at the man-woman power relation in 
        the context of the cultural field we have to take into consideration not 
        only a specific time and place frame but also what historians call the 
        <i>longue durée</i>, that is, inscribe the specific cultural field within 
        the more extended cultural system and its transformations in time. May 
        Sinclair’s critical fortune is an example of the continuing effect of 
        hegemonic critical work. Though she was in her own time a respected and 
        important writer, the critical hegemony of the avant-garde and the masculine 
        occupation of the cultural field, has managed to make her work irrelevant 
        for our understanding of modernism. And this attitude continues. In Euro-American 
        culture we are still, I believe, within an avant-gardist frame-of-mind 
        as well as within a male dominated cultural power system.</p>
      <p><strong>Locations and Paths 2: journals</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If we take as a starting point the journal <i>The 
        Freewoman—The Egoist</i> (on which the Macerata group has worked) as a 
        location and a subsystem in itself, we can build a number of different 
        paths connecting it with other similar sub-systems.  Synchronically, <i>The 
        Freewoman—The Egoist</i> can be first of all considered as a location 
        in the sub-system of British journals, such as <i>The New Age</i> and 
        <i>The Clarion, </i>which occupy an antagonistic cultural space. Contrasting 
        both hegemonic patriarchal cultural discourse and an official suffragist 
        stance, <i>The Freewoman</i> developed what Mark Morrisson has called 
        a “counter-hegemonic discourse.” But we can also form an empirical sub-system 
        along the diachronic axis and the geographic transatlantic Anglo-American 
        relationship, in which <i>The Freewoman</i> and all other journals are 
        locations characterized by having been created and directed by a woman 
        with a feminist perspective or within the emancipationist perspective. 
        We can then follow this path and link syncronically Charlotte Perkins 
        Gilman’s <i>Forerunner</i>—Emma Goldman’s <i>Mother Earth</i> (suffragist 
        papers)—to <i>Time and Tide</i>, but also to <i>The Little Review</i> 
        and <i>Poetry</i> and, moving on in time, to the journals financed and 
        created by Bryher—<i>Close-up</i>, and <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, 
        until, following a diachronic path, we get to the journal Kathleen Fraser 
        has created in the nineteen-eighties, <i>How(ever)</i>, and its sequel, 
        the hypermedia journal on the web, <i>HOW2</i>. In this way we will be 
        able to follow the role played by women like Rebecca West and Storm Jameson, 
        who link <i>The Freewoman—The Egoist</i> and <i>Time and Tide</i>, or 
        <i>Time and Tide</i> and <i>The New Age</i>. Or we can follow the connections 
        linking <i>The Egoist</i>, <i>Close Up</i> &amp; <i>Life and Letters To-day</i>, 
        through the contributions of H.D., May Sinclair, Dorothy Richardson, Gertrude 
        Stein and Muriel Rukeyser. In different ways these papers joined political 
        and artistic discourse.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Through Rukeyser we can branch out into leftist papers 
        like <i>New Masses</i> and connect American Marxism with the Spanish Civil 
        War. We can enter the Marxist and syndicalist discourses  relating Meridel 
        LeSueur or Tillie Olsen, Nancy Cunard and Rebecca West,  and contrast 
        them with the individualist path carved out by Dora Marsden, along which 
        we meet Gertrude Stein and H.D.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When we read them in relation to <i>How(ever)</i>, 
        we can also detect the changes in women’s consciousness that have made 
        it possible for Kathleen Fraser to weave into her journal artistic, political 
        and feminist discourses, appropriate language and its material and symbolic 
        power, with experiment again taking its position in the cultural field 
        as woman-identified woman. <A HREF="#_edn7"NAME="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
