      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">1. there have been no words. i have not written one 
        word. no poetry in the ashes south of canal street. no prose in the refrigerated 
        trucks driving debris and dna. not one word.  today is a week, and seven 
        is of heavens, gods, science. evident out my kitchen window is an abstract 
        reality. sky where once was steel. smoke where once was flesh.  fire in 
        the city air and i feared for my sister’s life in a way never before. 
        and then, and now, i fear for the rest of us.  first, please god, let 
        it be a mistake, the pilot’s heart failed, the plane’s engine died. then 
        please god, let it be a nightmare, wake me now. please god, after the 
        second plane, please, don’t let it be anyone who looks like my brothers.  
        i do not know how bad a life has to break in order to kill. i have never 
        been so hungry that i willed hunger i have never been so angry as to want 
        to control a gun over a pen. not really. even as a woman, as a palestinian, 
        as a broken human being. never this broken.  more than ever, i believe 
        there is no difference. the most privileged nation, most americans do 
        not know the difference between indians, afghanis, syrians, muslims, sikhs, 
        hindus. more than ever, there is no difference.  2. thank you korea for 
        kimchi and bibim bob, and corn tea and the genteel smiles of the wait 
        staff at wonjo — smiles never revealing the heat of the food or how tired 
        they must be working long midtown shifts. thank you korea, for the belly 
        craving that brought me into the city late the night before and diverted 
        my daily train ride into the world trade center.  there are plenty of 
        thank yous in ny right now. thank you for my lazy procrastinating late 
        ass. thank you to the germs that had me call in sick. thank you, my attitude, 
        you had me fired the week before. thank you for the train that never came, 
        the rude nyer who stole my cab going downtown. thank you for the sense 
        my mama gave me to run. thank you for my legs, my eyes, my life.  3. the 
        dead are called lost and their families hold up shaky printouts in front 
        of us through screens smoked up.  we are looking for iris, mother of three. 
        please call with any information. we are searching for priti, last seen 
        on the 103rd floor. she was talking to her husband on the phone and the 
        line went. please help us find george, also known as adel. his family 
        is waiting for him with his favorite meal. i am looking for my son, who 
        was delivering coffee. i am looking for my sister girl, she started her 
        job on monday.  i am looking for peace. i am looking for mercy. i am looking 
        for evidence of compassion. any evidence of life. i am looking for life.  
        4. ricardo on the radio said in his accent thick as yuca, “i will feel 
        so much better when the first bombs drop over there. and my friends feel 
        the same way.”  on my block, a woman was crying in a car parked and stranded 
        in hurt. i offered comfort, extended a hand she did not see before she 
        said, “we’re gonna burn them so bad, i swear, so bad.” my hand went to 
        my head and my head went to the numbers within it of the dead iraqi children, 
        the dead in nicaragua. the dead in rwanda who had to vie with fake sport 
        wrestling for america’s attention.  yet when people sent emails saying, 
        this was bound to happen, lets not forget u.s. transgressions, for half 
        a second i felt resentful. hold up with that, cause i live here, these 
        are my friends and fam, and it could have been me in those buildings, 
        and we’re not bad people, do not support america’s bullying. can i just 
        have a half second to feel bad?  if i can find through this exhaust people 
        who were left behind to mourn and to resist mass murder, i might be alright.  
        thank you to the woman who saw me brinking my cool and blinking back tears. 
        she opened her arms before she asked “do you want a hug?” a big white 
        woman, and her embrace was the kind only people with the warmth of flesh 
        can offer. i wasn’t about to say no to any comfort. “my brother’s in the 
        navy,” i said. “and we’re arabs.” “wow, you got double trouble.” word. 
        5. one more person ask me if i knew the hijackers. one more motherfucker 
        ask me what navy my brother is in. one more person assume no arabs or 
        muslims were killed. one more person assume they know me, or that i represent 
        a people. or that a people represent an evil. or that evil is as simple 
        as a flag and words on a page.  we did not vilify all white men when mcveigh 
        bombed oklahoma. america did not give out his family’s addresses or where 
        he went to church. or blame the bible or pat robertson.  and when the 
        networks air footage of palestinians dancing in the street, there is no 
        apology that hungry children are bribed with sweets that turn their teeth 
        brown. that correspondents edit images. that archives are there to facilitate 
        lazy and inaccurate journalism.  and when we talk about holy books and 
        hooded men and death, why do we never mention the kkk?  if there are any 
        people on earth who understand how new york is feeling right now, they 
        are in the west bank and the gaza strip.  6. today it is ten days. last 
        night bush waged war on a man once openly funded by the cia. i do not 
        know who is responsible. read too many books, know too many people to 
        believe what i am told. i don’t give a fuck about bin laden. his vision 
        of the world does not include me or those i love. and petitions have been 
        going around for years trying to get the u.s. sponsored taliban out of 
        power. shit is complicated, and i don’t know what to think.  but i know 
        for sure who will pay.  in the world, it will be women, mostly colored 
        and poor. women will have to bury children, and support themselves through 
        grief. “either you are with us, or with the terrorists” — meaning keep 
        your people under control and your resistance censored. meaning we got 
        the loot and the nukes.  in america, it will be those amongst us who refuse 
        blanket attacks on the shivering. those of us who work toward social justice, 
        in support of civil liberties, in opposition to hateful foreign policies. 
        i have never felt less american and more new yorker —particularly brooklyn, 
        than these past days. the stars and stripes on all these cars and apartment 
        windows represent the dead as citizens first — not family members, not 
        lovers.  i feel like my skin is real thin, and that my eyes are only going 
        to get darker. the future holds little light.  my baby brother is a man 
        now, and on alert, and praying five times a day that the orders he will 
        take in a few days time are righteous and will not weigh his soul down 
        from the afterlife he deserves.  both my brothers — my heart stops when 
        i try to pray — not a beat to disturb my fear. one a rock god, the other 
        a sergeant, and both palestinian, practicing muslim, gentle men. both 
        born in brooklyn and their faces are of the archetypal arab man, all eyelashes 
        and nose and beautiful color and stubborn hair.  what will their lives 
        be like now?  over there is over here.  7. all day, across the river, 
        the smell of burning rubber and limbs floats through. the sirens have 
        stopped now. the advertisers are back on the air. the rescue workers are 
        traumatized. the skyline is brought back to human size. no longer taunting 
        the gods with its height.  i have not cried at all while writing this. 
        i cried when i saw those buildings collapse on themselves like a broken 
        heart. i have never owned pain that needs to spread like that. and i cry 
        daily that my brothers return to our mother safe and whole.  there is 
        no poetry in this. there are causes and effects. there are symbols and 
        ideologies. mad conspiracy here, and information we will never know. there 
        is death here, and there are promises of more.  there is life here. anyone 
        reading this is breathing, maybe hurting, but breathing for sure. and 
        if there is any light to come, it will shine from the eyes of those who 
        look for peace and justice after the rubble and rhetoric are cleared and 
        the phoenix has risen.  affirm life. affirm life. we got to carry each 
        other now. you are either with life, or against it.affirm life.  </p>
