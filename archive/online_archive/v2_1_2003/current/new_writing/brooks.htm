      <P CLASS="TITLE2"><em>from</em> The Vertical City &nbsp; </P>

      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"> <strong>Small space </strong>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">This small space, this balcony, this window.</P>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">I could live in one room with a view like this. Across the harbour, past 
        Garden <br>
        Island, to the Bridge. We stand for a moment on the balcony above the 
        <br>
        magnolia tree, above the park, suspended, hanging out into space, almost 
        over <br>
        the water. Actually, above the black bituminous roof of the flats in front.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">After weeks looking at flats with underground rooms, and mould on the 
        walls, <br>
        I sat there for an hour, then walked back up the road and signed a lease.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">In Elizabeth Bay, the average unit of accommodation decreases in size. 
        Houses <br>
        shrink into studio apartments with roof gardens, verandahs become imaginary 
        <br>
        spaces, strung out in air suspended in front of windows. Gardens disappear 
        and<br>
        reappear in different places, as small parks, pots on balconies and windowsills.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Morning</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Across the still water of the harbour, early sunlight turns the windows 
        of a <br>
        North Sydney office block into mirrors, grey rectangles floating above 
        layers of <br>
        mist. You leave, and the day shapes itself around me, with newspapers 
        on<br>
        the floor, tea in white mugs, papers piled on the desk.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The bus turns into the loop.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Betty Bay Women</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The woman on the bus has a check coat and a raffish hat and Parkinson’s 
        <br>
        makes her face twitch a little.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">She asks me, <i>Are you a journ</i>o?</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">…</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>Oh, a booko.</i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>What about you?</i> I ask her.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>A person who lives on her meagre means</i>, she says. <i>When I found 
        this place <br>
        forty years ago, I thought, thank god. I don’t have to live in the suburbs.</i> 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Another woman gets on at the bus stop, perhaps seventy, carefully dressed, 
        <br>
        gold jewellery, silk scarf, stockings. <i>I’m off to the butcher to buy 
        my <br>
        cackleberries,</i> she says<i>.</i></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>Do you walk round by yourself?</i> I asked the 
        woman on the bus.</span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>We have to walk around by ourselves</i>,<i> 
        </i>she said<i>, because we live by ourselves. <br>
        If a man looks at me strangely I just say, hello sonny.</i></span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">These are the women from Betty Bay. The six daughters 
        of Alexander Macleay<br>
        lived in Elizabeth Bay House in the 1850s; one was called Kennethina. 
        Six girls <br>
        with long red hair and disembodied hands stitching homilies on pincushions. 
        <br>
        Mary Gilmore lived at the top of the hill in the 1920s; she was back from 
        the <br>
        Utopian colony in Paraguay, and writing for the Women’s Page of The <br>
        Worker. Flora Eldershaw and Marjorie Barnard held salons for writers in 
        <br>
        Orwell Street in the thirties. Then there were the Aunts up the Cross, 
        and <br>
        Rosaleen Norton, painter and witch, and other nameless eccentric women 
        with <br>
        brave wild unknown lives in single rooms. Some, like Juanita Neilsen, 
        stepped <br>
        over the line and disappeared.</span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><i>They say lots of writers live here</i>, M said 
        to me,<i> but you never see Helen <br>
        Garner on the bus. </i></span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">We live between the yacht club and the brothels, 
        between the Olympic sailing <br>
        events and the shooting galleries. Between a past we don’t usually feature 
        in <br>
        and a real estate boom that might squeeze us out. That’s capitalism, that’s<br>
        economic rationalism, folks.</span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The men with mobile phones are still selling women 
        and drugs, in cafes along <br>
        the crest of the hill. Up the hill it’s live and die in the streets, needles 
        and <br>
        condoms in the gutters, dead Koreans outside the restaurant, and working 
        <br>
        women in doorways with alert eyes. A woman’s body was found in an <br>
        alleyway, jammed between an old fridge and a dryer, bruised and strangled. 
        </span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Greetings from the Republic of Women, in the vertical 
        city. From well-dressed <br>
        older women waiting at bus stops, young women tossing their hair and walking<br>
        small dogs, middle-aged women walking purposefully up hills, disappearing<br>
        into art deco buildings, women with careers selling immaculate flats with 
        huge<br>
        floral arrangements on the table and nothing to eat in the kitchen, widows 
        <br>
        with money and stylish cars in rented garages. Women in suits or fancy 
        dress, <br>
        in red hair and tutus, jogging gear, female singles and couples, women 
        who <br>
        don’t conform. </span></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>The Parks</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The bus comes down the hill and round the corner and everything goes 
        quiet, <br>
        the water is metres away, the road loops back on itself. The park in the 
        middle<br>
        of the road has old fig trees that fill with fruit bats at night; and 
        in the daytime<br>
        the lorikeets swarm in the red flowering gums. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Holdsworth Street runs down to the old sandstone steps into Rushcutter’s 
        Bay <br>
        Park. On weekdays, backpackers lie in the sun and write letters home, 
        young <br>
        women with children sit in the cafe in the middle of the park, and you 
        see <br>
        women straight out of Patrick White novels. In the evenings, the dog-walkers 
        <br>
        arrive, their dogs swim among lumps of red algae. At the weekends there 
        are <br>
        couples having picnics, and three gay men, their arms around one another,<br>
        laughing, on a bench.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>The walks</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">This is one of my walks, the Yachtie walk, through Rushcutters Bay Park, 
        past<br>
        the tennis courts and across the ditch and round in front of the Cruising 
        Yacht <br>
        Club to flat sandy Yarranabbe Park and the public jetty. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Walking around Onslow and Billyard Avenue, through the park in front 
        of <br>
        Elizabeth Bay House, where you can sit on a bench and look out over the 
        <br>
        harbour, and feed the fish in the pond: this is the Retirement Walk, moving 
        <br>
        slowly from park bench to bus-stop seat. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">There’s a secret walk here: a detour down a narrow path between blocks 
        of<br>
        flats, under trees, to a grotto under the sandstone cliff. It should have 
        a statue<br>
        of a virgin, and flowers. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">There’s the Hate the Rich walk past Boomerang, which changed hands for 
        $30<br>
        odd million recently, past Lachlan Murdoch’s house, and the new waterfront 
        <br>
        penthouses with the reflection pool on the roof.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Roslyn Gardens: there are no parks or gardens here. This is a risky walk. 
        We<br>
        never liked this street; bad feng shui or something. The nursing home 
        on the <br>
        high side, boring flats on the other side. Paul Keating’s house in one 
        row of <br>
        three storey terraces, a model agency in the basement of another. We walk<br>
        along here to Cafe Hernandez, for the best coffee around here. Then across 
        the<br>
        overpass to Darlinghurst, Restaurant Gulch. We were robbed in this street, 
        <br>
        walking home on a rainy night. Footsteps behind us, then someone ran past 
        and<br>
        grabbed T’s briefcase. While we were still discussing what was in it, 
        a car with <br>
        no headlights came towards us, someone whistled and threw the briefcase 
        out <br>
        the window. Nothing gone except the Walkman. His wallet was still in his<br>
        pocket.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>Beare Park</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The bus turns down Ithaca Road towards Beare Park. A Korean man lives<br>
        here, he’s been there for years, my friends tell me; he always looks clean, 
        he’s <br>
        been sighted on the bus and in the local cafe. He wears a baseball cap 
        and track<br>
        pants, eats takeaway food, and keeps computer discs in a plastic bowl 
        under <br>
        the palm tree. At night, he howls at the moon, while someone plays bagpipes 
        at<br>
        the other end of the park.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Someone wrote a poem about this park, life and death in one rush, on 
        rotting <br>
        mattresses, under old fig trees.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">This place carves out a small public space on the waterfront of the rich, 
        <br>
        occupied by gay men reviving their tans, junkies doing deals, Telstra 
        workers <br>
        having lunch, and locals having picnics.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>The waterfront</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The cars of the rich appear and disappear through automatic gates. Trees 
        hang <br>
        over the garden wall. The wrought iron gates open and the black Porsches 
        slide <br>
        out noiselessly. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The apartments of the rich are absolute waterfront; nothing comes between 
        <br>
        them and their desires. Space, light, water. Boats moored at private jetties. 
        <br>
        Water taxis to the Opera house. Politician’s mistresses on the balcony.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Our bus grinds around the corner. A gardener vacuums leaves off the paths.  
        A <br>
        Latin American woman gets off the bus outside the waterfront apartment 
        <br>
        blocks: a generation of refugees escape fascism to come to Australia and 
        clean <br>
        rich people’s houses.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>Halfway up the hill</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">It’s lunchtime. The bus is halfway up the hill, outside the real estate 
        office, <br>
        opposite the cafe that spills out onto the street, beside the corner store, 
        the <br>
        bookshop with the S&amp;M and rocknroll display in the window (minor subjects:<br>
        tarot, art film, drugs, buddhism), and the Japanese restaurant. Prayer 
        flags on a <br>
        balcony in Roslyn Street, tourist buses outside the hotels. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">A Chinese man on the bus talks about getting a gun; a man with brilliantined<br>
        hair complains about bogong moths flying into his ears. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">As the bus turns into Darlinghurst Road, I see a man’s arm stretched 
        across the<br>
        window of a ground floor flat, a hand turning on a tap. We pass the Fountain, 
        <br>
        Porky’s and the shooting gallery, the Bourbon and Beefsteak. There are 
        <br>
        women working from doorways, men with mobile phones in Hungry Jack’s. 
        <br>
        The pavements, the fruit barrows, Japanese spruikers selling sixpacks 
        of koalas, <br>
        internet cafes, a shop full of telephone booths, blonde German backpackers 
        in <br>
        pavement cafes, seedy British backpackers smoking and drinking beer inside.  
      </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Inside the bus someone is talking about the axe murderer, he’s been sighted 
        in<br>
        the underground supermarket.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Get off the bus and walk. Around the corner, everything changes, the 
        video<br>
        shop, the pawnbrokers, the travel agencies offering cheap bus tickets 
        to Byron <br>
        Bay and Cairns and Broome, the backpacker hotels with towels hanging out 
        <br>
        the windows. It’s lunchtime at the Pad Thai with tables on the street. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Slabs of spare ribs in the windows of the doner kebab shops, and more 
        flesh <br>
        downstairs. Plastic cartons of take-away Thai, mobile phones on the cafe 
        table, <br>
        needles and polystyrene coffee cups on the station steps.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>Afternoon in the street</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">In Kings Cross public and private merge: the street 
        is an office and the doorway a <br>
        bedroom. Men with ponytails and numbers tied to their trousers talk to 
        the <br>
        street about live acts on stage. Passing Porky’s I hear a woman miming 
        <br>
        orgasm, ah ah aah aaah… that’s all folks, she says, huskily: how publicly 
        <br>
        intimate, in the afternoon street. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Women on the streets wear short skirts and keep their faces blank. The 
        large<br>
        blonde woman with notable breasts is talking to a young Aboriginal man. 
        On<br>
        the pavement near the telephones a man is creating instant airbrushed 
        art, <br>
        across the road the Christian rock ’n rollers play near the condom shop.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">In Darlinghurst Road, people eat, sleep, crash in doorways, hustle, shoot 
        up, <br>
        nod off, do business in doorways, crouch among plastic shopping bags, 
        hesitate <br>
        and get robbed in doorways. A woman with legs in black tights, graceful 
        like a <br>
        dancer, stretched across the doorway, looks relaxed from the window of 
        the<br>
        bus, but close up I can see she’s got the shakes.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Off the street, other people lean on windowsills, pause on balconies, 
        read<br>
        newspapers in cafes and parks. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Sometimes, the Cross is quiet. Say, in January, in the afternoons. The 
        axe <br>
        murderer walked into the police station and gave himself up one Friday 
        night. <br>
        The Korean groceries are out of sticky rice, the yachts have left for 
        Hobart, the <br>
        tourist shops are empty.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">But along the strip it’s always four o’clock in the morning and the Coke 
        sign is <br>
        always flashing.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
       
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><strong>Afternoon</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Yellow light floods my room in the middle of the afternoon. A mandala 
        of <br>
        lorikeets and answering machines. The low hum of traffic all day, punctuated 
        <br>
        by buses grinding around the corner. Dinghies gliding across the bay, 
        a sound <br>
        of ripples against the sandstone wall. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Small rainstorms cross the harbour in the late afternoon.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Pink sunsets, sudden gusts of wind. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Evenings in Victoria Street</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The travellers patrol the street at dusk talking softly; they sit in 
        cafes drinking <br>
        and writing letters home. In immaculate white uniforms, the men and women 
        <br>
        from the naval dockyards on Garden Island filter through local traffic 
        and <br>
        layers of history: past the high walls of the convent, past the huge blocks 
        of <br>
        flats where the developers won battles thirty years ago, the old terraces 
        that the<br>
        residents fought for and saved, Mick Fowler’s Steps down to Woolloomooloo;<br>
        past Joe’s Famous where men in gold neck chains with mobile phones hang 
        on<br>
        the pavement, past the Korean cafes serving ‘the chef’s special intestines’, 
        the <br>
        antiquarian bookshop, the second hand clothes shop, the hotels along Victoria<br>
        Street, to where the streets converge near the hotel with the Ginseng 
        Baths and <br>
        the Cocacola sign. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Going Inside</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Inside our rooms, we inhabit calm spaces, we stand at windows in the 
        warm <br>
        evenings, listening to fruit bats squabbling in the tops of the trees. 
        We <br>
        rearrange still lives, in endless mirrors, in double beds. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Take away the walls, and we are stacked, head to toe, on different floors 
        of <br>
        apartment buildings, ready to float out of our bodies, ready to merge 
        and <br>
        separate, to dance away again, out above Betty Bay.</p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp;</p>
        
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Night</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">At night, I move around the room slowly and come to rest in front of 
        the <br>
        window. I drag the bed across the room to face the view. The red navigation 
        <br>
        light flashes on the bridge, ships in the dry dock are lit up. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">At night, there’s a city in the sky. Not like Augustine’s city, more 
        like Dante’s<br>
        purgatory. There are lights along the hill, above the black space of the 
        water. <br>
        The blue mosque-like roof of an office building visible through a gap 
        between <br>
        buildings on the hill. Across the still black water, the lights of cars 
        driving to <br>
        and from the naval depot, and slow moving ferries. US warships visit in 
        the <br>
        nuclear night. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The Korean man sleeps in his corrugated cardboard shelter. Beside the 
        freeway <br>
        the taxi drivers, students and security men at the end of their shifts 
        cruise into <br>
        Cafe Hernandez, open twenty four hours a day. Up the hill it’s sex and 
        money,<br>
        down the hill it’s fun fun fun, men in tight leather trousers on Mardi 
        Gras night,<br>
        diving in and out of taxis. Cats on heat, short glossy fur and leopard 
        skin tights. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">Windows in the sky are lit up all night, and lights burn in mirrored 
        foyers. The <br>
        shift changes around five in the morning, the late home-comers meet the 
        early <br>
        workers as first light hits grey streets. 
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">&nbsp; 
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b>Leaving</b></p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE"><b></b>Walking back through King X at 5.30 on a Friday evening, I watch 
        the drag<br>
        queens in the beauty parlours having their fingernails razor tipped and 
        the home <br>
        boys talking on their mobile phones on the corners. I pass the hair salon 
        called <br>
        Anysex in Kellett St.  Two girls walk up Roslyn Street, laughing and talking, 
        <br>
        with bright pink and blue hair. The Maori warrior with his satin cowboy 
        shirt <br>
        passes me in Ward Avenue, and the tourists are piling in and out of buses 
        in <br>
        front of the Gazebo and Sebel Town House. </p>
      <P CLASS="HALFSPACE">The evening is soft, a sign it’s nearly spring, and the clouds are dark 
        grey, <br>
        behind the harbour bridge and the city skyline. For a moment there’s nothing 
        <br>
        but the sound of the water and children’s voices from the park, then the 
        bus<br>
        goes round the Elizabeth Bay loop, and a car starts up, and two birds 
        wheel <br>
        overhead; and the evening starts to whirr again. Winter is over. I’m leaving 
        <br>
        Kings X.</p>
