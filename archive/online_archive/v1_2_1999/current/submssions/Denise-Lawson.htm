<B><P>Working Notes:  </B>If I could ask for a gift, it would be to sing. As a result, I try to bring out the music in my poems through the sounds of the words, the placement of the lines, linebreaks, and punctuation.  The forms  emerge out of a process of copying lines over and over (in longhand) in an attempt to see which words are worth keeping.  With shorter poems, I re-write the lines from memory to sift out the nonessential.  The material for the poems comes from my notetaking, which includes dreams, experiences, quotations from my reading, overheard conversations, descriptions of places I&#39;ve traveled, etc.  These notes accumulate and then from time to time I sit down and re read them and pull out images and ideas and lines that obsess me. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                <B>Wakefulness</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                                        (and when does she sing)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                                        (sing to herself)</P>
<P>                </P>

<P>                                        (as her mother, in the morning)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                                        (sings)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>forgetful of error</P>
<P>I tender</P>
<P>an offering of salt</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ungainly affection,</P>
<P>knotted with sweetness&#8212;</P>
<P>cord or corridor?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>desire, a scarlet coat; </P>
<P>water glass held to the skin</P>
<P>for coolness</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I can&#39;t unsay&#8212;</P>
<P>the night is chalked with questions</P>
<P>and I am wakeful</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>               <B> desire (comma) leviathan</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                2</P>

<P>the whale, white as candleflame, crosses the ocean</P>
<P>as easily as a woman crosses a room</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                3</P>

<P>love those who leave you and return</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                4</P>
<P> </P>
<P>returning home, </P>
<P>she notices the tree beside her house</P>
<P>                        this, she decides, is loyalty</P>

<P>                what is there to say except</P>

<P>a tree, rooted and solitary</P>

<P>                7</P>

<P>                she takes a ruler and erases it</P>
<P>using, as measurement, the phases of the moon</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                9</P>

<P>having asked the only thing that matters</P>
<P>        in a postscript</P>

<P>                                                        not mine</P>

<P>contingent ardor, the sky splits with color</P>

<P>what is place? anything breakable</P>
<P>        </P>
<P>                tell it in the third person layered over the first</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                11</P>

<P>flank</P>
<P>           ravenous eye, a white camera</P>
<P>           succession of color, burning</P>

<P>                kindling the senses trues the blade</P>

<P>mistaking I for I and you for someone else</P>
<P>the history of two voices</P>

<P>                                        stripped</P>

<P>fidelitas</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>        </P>
<P>                12</P>

<P>whetstone</P>

<P>                        cipher</P>

<P>last night the moon&#8212;no, the sun&#8212;</P>
<P>        glory and liquid</P>

<P>        absence, the hollowed out</P>

<P>rainwater urgent for the sea</P>

<P>                                        not mine, but my portion</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                13</P>

<P>two fortunes, cracked open, identical</P>

<P>speaker, layer the third over the first</P>
<P>        kindle the senses, true the blade</P>

<P>as genesis, an asterisk in a french novel</P>

<P>fidelous in it capriciousness</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>                15</P>

<P>                                                my portion</P>

<P>strangers touch after laughter</P>
