<P>Working notes: </B>  I can't say that I even intended to write these; that is, they're not propositional in any way. But I became fascinated by the ways in which lines arranged themselves around a focal point--generally grounded in sound and the underlying affiliations between words rather than events--and that without trying to shape them with any formal constraints, these poems emerged in roughly the same form and with roughly the same kind of interdependency.  I spend a lot of time commuting so my line is often sporadic &amp; sprung, filled with minor subject matter except for the backdrop of transitoriness, which seems to run through the sonnet as a form. And since I tend to write poems by carving away at them for months at a time, I wanted a title that suggested some kind of compression and some degree of lyric openness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To live in someone </P>
<P>else&#39;s music</P>
<P>(the musician not the composer is free)</P>
<P>a divine contention</P>
<P>like the damp carpet</P>
<P>of liquored olivia trees</P>
<P>(something my favorite you </P>
<P>would say)</P>
<P>finding in a hollow day</P>
<P>a winter keeper</P>
<P>a paper woman</P>
<P>caught in the torrent</P>
<P>not quite falling</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Figs of lost thought</P>
<P>rainy differences and non-glides</P>
<P>feverish in girlways</P>
<P>the tenuous escape of a patient</P>
<P>nodding, obstinate</P>
<P>jeweled or pinked</P>
<P>a pilling station</P>
<P>(laughing, molten)</P>
<P>behind a gay exterior</P>
<P>or broad caplet</P>
<P>too tough to swallow</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Carrying an atmosphere</P>
<P>beaten out like sound</P>
<P>a still life of amnesty</P>
<P>on the little lane</P>
<P>trees are safely tucked</P>
<P>below the wires</P>
<P>a darkness carried</P>
<P>out of childhood,</P>
<P>other kindnesses</P>
<P>&quot;I looked&quot;</P>
<P>and fell to</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Unable to hire oneself</P>
<P>for labor or to know</P>
<P>the green, braided thing</P>
<P>someone sees</P>
<P>inside you</P>

<P>forgetting your grasp</P>
<P>or &quot;words&quot;</P>
<P>in a paper understanding</P>
<P>a paper flap of happy self</P>
<P>your dream above your head</P>
<P>like comic weather</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The teacher&#39;s love</P>
<P>of someone&#39;s children</P>
<P>a flash of light </P>
<P>in white air</P>

<P>so loving love</P>
<P>we lack science</P>
<P>and in ourselves </P>
<P>touch up the little teacher&#39;s picture</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thinking through</P>
<P>a desperate wedge</P>
<P>of indivisible ink</P>
<P>I fall in filaments</P>
<P>an uncontrolled breeze</P>
<P>nutsy, bottled</P>
<P>forged &amp; forgot</P>
<P>crawling (not climbing) down</P>
<P>netted, I bet</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As proud &amp; difficult as greek</P>
<P>a vigil (or Virgil) </P>
<P>kept bright</P>
<P>waiting to happen</P>
<P>your father walking</P>
<P>toward your mother</P>
<P>as you briefly look away</P>
<P>then follow like a nonsense syllable</P>
<P>Ma. Pa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Loving the human bird&#8212;</P>
<P>the bright converse </P>
<P>of yellow-flowered grasses&#8212;</P>
<P>why aren&#39;t we lying </P>
<P>in miles of weedy clover?</P>
<P>The bright boat, tumbling through it</P>
<P>the blue of it&#8212;Or,</P>
<P>taking the kid out of the picture</P>
<P>(what you loved to see)</P>
<P>a girl who talks to birds&#8212;Don&#39;t go.</P>
<P>Let&#39;s delay or&#8212;like Shakespeare&#8212;&quot;fly&quot;</P>
<P>all disappointment</P>
<P>in the green and untidy</P>
<P>molecular air.</P>
