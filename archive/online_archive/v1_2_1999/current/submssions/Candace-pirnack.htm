<B><P>Working Note</B>:  These poems were written in a spirit of inquisitiveness and admiration.  I had been reading Eigner and was trying to understand his use of space and object on the page&#8212;what it is that his poems do and how they do it.  "From Themselves" responds to both his poetry and his writings on poetry.  Similarly, "<I>a </I>narrative" draws as much from Jandl's explication of his "erschaffung der eva" as from his poem itself&#8212;an amazing poem, I think&#8212;yet one I felt needed a rebuttal, however mild, to the patriarchal infrastructure upon which his poem is built.</P>
