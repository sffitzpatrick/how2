<B><P>Working Notes:  </B>It is often the case that I learn more than I intend in writing poems. Preoccupations do act as magnets, but I am most interested when accidents show me something I hadn't thought of in any explicit, conscious way and allow me to read my work as if someone else had written it.  Sometimes these "accidents" do seem to address questions that I circle around more consciously, and to do so more effectively than any of my  "conscious" attempts.  For example, in "Cast" I stumbled onto the form simply because I was convinced that the lines which now occupy the position of margin notes belonged to the poem.  The challenge was how to work them in . The mechanical act of placing them on the left side of the page  exerted an influence over the final stages of writing and also suggested numerous readings of the form which became evident to me only after the poem was written.  The relation of the synopsis, commentary, or interpretation to a text or an event; who speaks and who is spoken for; how authority is suggested or achieved in writing are among the things this form seems, at least to me, to suggest.  While these issues are often present in a conscious way, finding a form to enact them happened largely by chance and on a dare.  Hopefully there are more ways of reading the form than I have here suggested.</P>

<B><P>Gene Expression</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A vocabulary handed </P>
<P>down through </P>
<P>letters twined in nature</P>
<P>nurture's alphabetic double </P>
<P>helixes where opposites attract</P>
<P>a myth encoded to protect</P>
<P>the public from the audible</P>
<P>expression of neologies</P>
<P>which propagate</P>
<P>recessive points of </P>
<P>view and threaten</P>
<P>to disorient the language</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>The Structure of Detachment</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>tangled currents, dark </P>
<P>submerging dark</P>

<P>reflections </P>
<P>wave as they tug </P>

<P>at their roots</P>
<P>a few weeds </P>

<P>plucked </P>
<P>from the unsteady </P>

<P>fragile braid, the sensate</P>
<P>strung together, self </P>

<P>within a sheen of self</P>

<P>&#9;the voice </P>
<P>might be a line</P>

<P>that gropes toward </P>
<P>surface</P>

<P>dangling </P>
<P>in the foreground</P>

<P>solids where the gaze</P>
<P>might rest</P>

<P>a raft tossed out</P>
<P>the glittering</P>

<P>thread </P>

<B><P>Postcard from Aphasia</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;    <I>for Candace Pirnak</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the cherished </P>
<P>certainties are dangling here</P>
<P>&#9;The distance seems</P>

<P>&#9;a little asymmetrical</P>
<P>My name is </P>
<P>an haphazard shelter</P>
<P>&#9;it is propped</P>

<P>&#9;on the conditional</P>
<P>it does not keep me</P>
<P>warm  Most words</P>
<P>&#9;I do not understand</P>

<P>&#9;their lattice </P>
<P>structure, and the stillness</P>
<P>they extract</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Half-life </P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This silence is meticulous,</P>
<P>enduring.  Touch / don&#39;t touch</P>
<P>is what it says, and that is </P>
<P>what we did, blacked out</P>
<P>entire chapters at a time</P>
<P>so we were always partially</P>
<P>submerged in pools of ink&#8212;</P>

<I><P>legal by default </P>

<P>of connotation</P>
<P>I have tried</P>
<P>to tell you but</P>
<P>my code is broken</P>
<P>clarity has</P>
<P>consequences</P>
<P>so we live</P>
<P>in the ellipses</P>
<P>on the line</P>
<P>where one tongue meets</P>
<P>another nowhere</P>

<P>Why am I surprised that they </P>
<P>still write us into sickness.  </P>
<P>The atmosphere  is lined </P>
<P>with odes  to information </P>
<P>wildly detached from any </P>
<P>actuality.   Have I not also</P>
<P>sung along.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;I had thought that definition was a chamber</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;where ambiguous desires take on shape, the way</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;a hand will trace its own reflection in pursuit  </P>
<P>&#9;&#9;of perfect forgery.  And that this is why</P>
<P>Stuck in the silver&#9;&#9;the category of the lesbian is useful.  As if without it</P>
<P>between two rooms&#9;I could no more think to kiss her than ignore</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;that pressure at the edge of my vocabulary.  </P>
<P>&#9;&#9;Or climb down from the hyperbole to find my way </P>
<P>&#9;&#9;through the complexities of such a statement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Perhaps the  &quot;I&quot; could function as an anchor,</P>
<P>&#9;or a frame.  Although it binds</P>
<P>&#9;one movement to the next, the chord is</P>
<P>She wanted to escape&#9;nothing to hang onto.  Notes decay</P>
<P>her own reflection, or&#9;to the fragility of gesture as you reach to touch</P>
<P>she wanted to inhabit it&#9;the contours of a face as seen through cloth</P>
<P>&#9;and even light slows down when traveling </P>
<P>&#9;through the fibrous metaphors </P>
<P>&#9;mistaken for the native language of the psyche.</P>

<P>&#9;In fact, it is a system of gravel paths</P>
<P>&#9;that never hook up in a clearing.  All night,</P>
<P>&#9;we paced the edges of what looked like solid ground,</P>
<P>Loose on its hinges, the exit&#9;deepening the grooves instead of repositioning  </P>
<P>alludes to itself and is&#9;the lines by which we&#39;d been partitioned  </P>
<P>reversible&#9;into speech.  Or mapping out a more accommodating </P>
<P>&#9;theory of attraction.  Soldered to the this/that </P>
