<P>Working note: </B> This is the opening of a story that will be published in Don Berger's magazine <I>My Friends</I>.  I wrote it over the course of a month, listening compulsively to Dawn Upshaw sing Gorecki's Third Symphony.  I was wondering what really alters in us, with time, and whether there isn't some part, given certain circumstances, that remains as it was years and years ago.  The story is a dream about that, I suppose.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CHILD'S TALE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by Alison Bundy</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;I was born an infant, a child I became, and a child I am now, after these thirty-six years of life.  Why I have not developed as others have, why this body has remained the body it was some thirty years ago, and whether I will die a child still in a childish smocked dress, red shoes&#8212;,  these things I do not know.  I have read many books and have not found the answers there.</P>
<P>&#9;Years ago, physicians spent much time ministering to me, in vain attempts to cure; scientists much time attempting to discover the laws of the science which operates somewhere within me. </P>
<P>&#9;I lay  quietly then beneath their hands and knives, saving  my tears,  and time passed as they tapped and probed, rolled me on my table through long  fluorescent tunnels; time passed as their needles drew blood, gave fluid; and in time I saw their curiosity and awe change to frustration, dislike, perhaps even disgust: time passed and their white coats drooped at the shoulders, the learned heads bent, they did not now look into the blood and bone with the same close verve they had once exhibited;  now, they turned their backs and closed the steel cases bearing the calibrated instruments, and now they sighed, and the light in the room was dim, and it hurt my eyes to keep them open, and whereas once these men and women had spoken clearly now they mumbled, and they no doubt thought of home, as we all do when tired, and of their families, the children whose limbs grew correctly on schedule, whose bodies thickened and thinned in the proper places, and they looked forward to stepping into their houses, that evening, they looked forward to resuming the difficulties of life en famille, as they say in a foreign phrase. </P>
<P>&#9;Look at me now.  I have been called dwarf, midget:  I am neither.  I have not so much aged as been carried impeccably forward by time; you will find no lines on my face or hands; my fingernails are the thin iridescent nails of a young child.  In this country which adores youth I am young beyond adoration; it is as if the country went to sleep and dreamed badly, and I stepped out of the dream.</P>
<P>&#9;It is many years now since I allowed myself the words:  What if it had been... what if I....  One must somehow live.  Yet from time to time, against my will, those phrases present themselves without being sought, like a melody that appears suddenly after years and years, carrying with it, it seems, another time.... </P>

<P>&#9;I knew my mother as the sole member of my family, and she attempted various schemes, while she could, to draw comfort from the calamity of my person, generally preferring, of course, her comfort in the form of dollars.  In a large blue Chrysler we set out one summer, touring on exhibit.  I was twenty-one;  public interest in my case had waned some long time ago.  We drove toward the middle of the country, as my mother had the impression people there were ill-informed;  she appeared to believe television and newspapers had never passed the great frontier plains of Ohio:  she believed, in short, that I was news for which people would pay. </P>
<P>&#9;At the western edge of Ohio we stopped in Fort Recovery, a town which did not live up to its name, and she found on the single, tattered outskirt of that place a sign painter who agreed to paint my portrait, full-length, upon each of the car's two doors.  He took a photograph of me, not without some trouble: my mother had the idea that I should be painted <I>from life</I> , as she kept saying.  Will it cost more to do her <I>from life</I>?  I'd like them really to <I>see</I> what she looks like.  Aren't all the good portraits done <I>from life</I>?  Now look, if I stand her here....</P>
<P>&#9;He waited until Mother paused to draw breath and then he held up the paint-spattered camera and said sullenly, This <I>is </I>from life. </P>
<P>&#9;He worked for two days on the job.  I am a rarity but I am not pretty, and the man's art did not improve my looks.  The faint ridge under the car's windows defined the top of my head as a square; my long braids were rendered as leaden pipes; this narrow face became longer set on the curve of the door, and although the painter told me to smile when he took my picture and I did, the portrait showed a person, or rather, child, whose wit had departed days ago and who now stood dully, mouth open, as if listening to incomprehensible commands.  </P>
<P>&#9;Next to this character, who sported a pink frothy dress (a figment of the painter's imagination&#8212; he must have grouped all feminine trappings under the heading Bubble Bath), waved a gold banner on which was lettered in black gothic script the motto of my mother's brainstorm:  UNAGING MIRACLE  .  </P>
<P>&#9;She must at some point have recounted the drama of my condition, for when the job had been approved and the painter had his money in his hand, he winked at me.  I guess we're all stuck someways, he said.  He picked up a jar from the board holding his paints and took a long drink.  Thank him, my mother said in a stage whisper, and she opened the car door and pushed me in.</P>

<P>&#9;In Indiana Mother parked at the edge of a strip mall and pondered the mystery of theatrical space, how to create it.  She had sung in a choir as a girl, up on the stage of the school auditorium, but that event had not prepared her for the venue she now considered.   She determined in any case that what she lacked in experience she would make up for with enthusiasm,  and drapes: in  a yardgoods store lengths of shiny sky-blue material, of scarlet, were purchased.   With a hammer and tacks she hung the blue in the back windows of the car: the loose, looping folds hinted strangely at canopy beds, powder puffs, enticing privacies of the boudoir or, perhaps, of the hearse. </P>
<P>&#9;For the attraction itself, she paid to have fabricated a stand of rather ingenious design, whose square platform lifted, telescoping out into three tiers of hinged wood.   From the bottom tier rose four retractable poles, and from a line running through the tops of these  my mother hung scarlet satin flocked by lines of velvet fleurs-de-lis. Where she came by the money for these elaborations, I do not know.  It was not, in any case, for me to ask questions, it was rather for me to be silent and stand on the platform, hidden by  the dense cloth that surrounded me, separated from my public and cooler air until that time when I heard my mother proclaim, <I>I will now unveil</I>,-- and she paused-- <I>the world's only Unaging Miracle</I>, and then she drew back the front panels, and I opened my arms and turned, with a gentle tapping of my white patent-leather shoes, in a circle first one way and then the other while my mother told the story of science's failure to follow my body across the frontier it was traversing.  She wove into my story  other tales of the unknown:  aspects of the planet Pluto which no one has ever seen; her own mother who was born without an appendix and upon whose lovely arms and legs hair had never sprouted;  then on to her lack of suspicion during my seventh and eighth years when she and my teachers thought I was "just a bit" slow; famous hospitals I had frequented; moment of stupendous realization; mysteries of the atom; failure of menses to occur; this monologue ending with finesse on a list of questions designed to stir her audience to a consideration of all they did not know:  what happened to the dinosaurs?  how did Jesus arrange the loaves and fishes?  where is the end of the universe? if a dog could talk what would it say?  and, finally, what is the nature of a dream?</P>
<P>&#9;My mother was naive but intelligent, and I always appreciated her refusal in this speech of the chicken or egg conundrum.  Her reliance on matters involving the planets, however, made me dizzy.  I stood in the heat, there on the platform, imagining the endless dark of space, how one was tinier in comparison than the smallest speck of the finest dust, how one could fall into the dark, and fall irretrievably, life lost, all connection severed except the primary one, the one between body and the void, that connection from which comes all instruction and all anxiety, and the faces of my public wavered before me, the children in front with open mouths and trusting eyes, the large, polite, blond women and men, and my knees went weak and I stuttered in movement as I tapped a thank you and gave a curtsey, and then the curtain was replaced, and I stood alone, staring at the fuzzy scarlet fleurs-de-lis, while my mother answered questions.</P>
<P>&#9;She encountered, of course and as I had predicted, a serious problem: resembling  a normal six-year old, being in no overt way a freak, I made a better story than spectacle.  The miracle did not show itself in the moment, so to speak, but over time, and many mild, skeptical voices rose that summer: <I>How do we know she's not just  a kid?  She looks like a kid to me.  </I>I had suggested I be allowed to answer questions; my mother felt that would complicate matters, and tried instead to allay doubt by exhibiting a birth certificate; she held up newspaper articles documenting the case, and pinned to a folding easel a series of dated photographs which seemed worthless, for there I was in each, wearing different clothes but otherwise unaltered, the whole sequence suggesting a primitive fashion show rather than time's progress.... Perhaps if the pictures had been taken outside, by trees, showing the season....Or if Mother had stood next to me, aging across the years while I remained, like a figure more plastic than human, as I was, as I was, as I am.</P>
<P>&#9;But this was in the Midwest and only once or twice did anyone press my mother beyond the initial, questioning exchange. </P>
