<B><P>Working Notes:</B>  I&#39;m fascinated by Supreme Court transcripts. What&#39;s of particular interest to me is how so often &quot;justice&quot; comes down to issues of grammar. For a while now I&#39;ve been receiving summaries (via email) of Supreme Court decisions through the Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School. In the work below, I&#39;ve chosen cases where language rules obviously held the key to some of the decision making. I then asserted my own version of the rule on the summary itself. I&#39;ve included an excerpt from the summary followed by the results of my procedures.</P>

<P>Summary Excerpt:</P>
<P>UNITED STATES v. RODRIGUEZ-MORENO</P>
<P>Argued December 7, 1998 &#8212; Decided March 20, 1999</P>

<P>A drug distributor hired respondent and others to find a New York drug dealer who stole cocaine from him during a Texas drug transaction and to hold captive the middleman in the transaction, Ephrain Avendano, during the search. The group drove from Texas to New Jersey to New York to Maryland, taking Avendano with them. Respondent took possession of a revolver in Maryland and threatened to kill Avendano. Avendano eventually escaped and called police, who arrested respondent and the others. Respondent was charged in a New Jersey District Court with, inter alia, using and carrying a firearm in relation to Avendano&#39;s kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. sect. 924(c)(1). He moved to dismiss that count, arguing that venue was proper only in Maryland, the only place where the Government had proved he had actually used a gun. The court denied the motion, and respondent was convicted of the sect. 923(c)(1) offense. The Third Circuit reversed. After applying what it called the &quot;verb test,&quot; it determined that venue was proper only in the district where a defendant actually uses or carries a firearm.</P>

<P>Procedure: The Verb Test</P>
<P>NITE SATES (MORE Venn diagrams)</P>

<P>Chatter the embers, you must cut off the arc. Your action, Ephrain Avendano, is like a knock out from the inside of the arc.  You fell down through the air of Texas  New Jersey  New York  Maryland, into a pond; a session held in the mind.</P>

<P>Ill Avendano.  Avendano in the ally eluding memory. A call. New Jersey District Court whines, hums and whistles a fire. You relocate, don&#39;t realize your hat is still on; the hat disintegrates (morally). Government ads target and reckon use.  You injure your own feelings, extinguish them, dent and declare guilty.  Concealed Circuits familiarize then ravage the &quot;verb test,&quot; invalidate all use of spoken or written fires.</P>

<P>To carry on:  Venn roses whine, hum and whistle expressing ire. Ions are neglected. You curse, curt, and we reckon dents. Situated off (you are off) a hen throws dice and appears cured. The United States is tough; your Third Circuit presents false information. You declare that verbs deter us from action; you are off. Your Court as ever a verb and so judges the illusion that men are required to injure themselves. Off in spite of the big bed you assume to exist during tins to din duct men. Violently torn into pieces, whine, hum and whistle&#8212;the ads are weeping; you&#39;re neglecting your kid. A rime rests with torso vertical, tin arts violently torn into pieces. Local venn ropes encircle your car (now that&#39;s art)</P>
<P>a target you neglected. The United States chatters. Answer chatter, hat on, advance your </P>
<P>pace. Here you mimic a coin with absurd results. Then mimic unit rime, &quot;hi, I do no mat hat&quot; into a pond. You employ Maryland and curse &quot;during and in relation to&quot; the kid&#39;s urgent pleas. Your kid, &quot;hi,&quot; he&#39;s off and suffers. As you walk back and forth (there&#39;s art to walking), venn props present false rime. An offense to adore.</P>

<P>Summary Excerpt:</P>
<P>GRAY v. MARYLAND</P>
<P>Argued December 8, 1997 &#8212; Decided March 9, 1998</P>

<P>Anthony Bell confessed to the police that he, petitioner Gray, and another man participated in the beating that caused Stacy Williams&#39; death. After the third man died, a Maryland grand jury indicted Bell and Gray for murder, and the State tried them jointly. When the trial judge permitted the State to introduce a redacted version of Bell&#39;s confession, the detective who read it to the jury said &quot;deleted&quot; or &quot;deletion&quot; whenever the name of Gray or the third participant appeared. Immediately after that reading, however, the detective answered affirmatively when the prosecutor asked, &quot;after [Bell] gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest...Gray; is that correct?&quot; The State also introduced a written copy of the confession with the two names omitted, leaving in their place blanks separated by commas. The judge instructed the jury that the confession could be used as evidence only against Bell, not Gray. The jury convicted both defendants.</P>

<P>literary addendum:</P>

<P>Emily Dickinson wrote</P>

<P>Step lightly on&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>This narrow spot &#8212;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>The broadest Land&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>That grows&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>Is not so Ample</P>
<P>As the Breast</P>
<P>These Emerald</P>
<P>Seams enclose</P>

<P>Step lofty, for</P>
<P>This name be told</P>
<P>As far as Cannon</P>
<P>Dwell</P>
<P>Or Flag subsist</P>
<P>Or Fame export</P>
<P>Her deathless</P>
<P>Syllable</P>

<P>But in the fasicle version, this poem appears as a field of X&#39;s, due to how Dickinson chose to cross her T&#39;s and F&#39;s:</P>

<P>&#9;S X e p     l i g h x l y       on</P>
<P>&#9;X his    n a r r o w      S p o x &#8212;</P>
<P>&#9;X h e    b r o a d e s x   X a n d</P>
<P>&#9;T h a t    g r o w s</P>
<P>&#9;I s        n o X   s o    a m p l e</P>
<P>&#9;A s    X h e     B r e a s x</P>
<P>&#9;X h e s e       E m e r a l d</P>
<P>&#9;S e a m s    e n c l o s e .</P>

<P>&#9;S X e p     l o f t y  ,  f o r</P>
<P>&#9;X h i s   n a m e    b e  xold</P>
<P>&#9;A s     f a r   a s   C a nnon</P>
<P>&#9;D w e l l</P>
<P>&#9;O r    X l  a g    S u b s i s X</P>
<P>&#9;O r    X a m e  E x p o r X</P>
<P>&#9;H e r        d  e  a  x h l e s s</P>
<P>&#9;S y l l a   b l e</P>

<P>The X&#39;s are stitches in the picture of the poem.  Letters are actually what sew the &quot;seam,&quot; and what they enclose is the dead body in its emerald "spot."  What is equally interesting is the apparent discarding of the dash.  Thus, the poem has a squarer look to it&#39;a plain, a plot, a field.  The more defined/geometric the space, the more it resembles a space enclosed.  The dashes signify an opening, but this poem has a concrete and pictorial surface, patched in places by the letter "X"</P>

<P>There&#39;s a confession that links a man&#39;s name to a body beneath a field of X&#39;s. The man attempts to remove his name from the penalty box. He wants to become the X, the blank spot. The court eventually agrees to this, but the mark is still there. The X is both an absence and a presence.</P>
