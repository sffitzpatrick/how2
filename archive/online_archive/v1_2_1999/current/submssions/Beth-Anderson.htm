<P>Working Note: </B> <I>In Residence</I> is a cycle of twelve poems.  The project was initiated on a manual typewriter one autumn when the prospect of moving loomed large and nearly definite, when my professional obligations loomed equally large and very definite, and when I had finished rereading Williams’s <I>Kora in Hell</I>.  I took as my model Williams’s writing process as he describes it in his introduction to <I>Kora</I>; he wrote every night for a year no matter the circumstances and revised the results into the poem.  My typewriter gave the act of writing a physicality that meshed with the concerns of the writing; throughout the cycle place and replacement recur, generated by motifs of structure and structuring, buildings and building.  <I>In Residence</I> was completed some months prior to my move and before I knew where that move would land me, so the poems are acts of anticipation.  Their descriptions of place imagine the hunt for it, the method of finding placement, the process of giving up a city where I’d lived for a decade even as I continued to live in it.</P>

<P>Four poems from <I>In Residence</I>:</P>

<B><P>An accusation abetted</P>
<P>Yonder dry dry grasses</P>
<P>A deed of title</P>
<P>The royal we</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>An accusation abetted</P>
</B>
<P>When you refuse me stories because of slight variance</P>
<P>I cannot clear a space for lightening. It remains veiled by environment, </P>
<P>prepares to sail through gorges along the river that will be </P>
<P>purposely flooded in twelve years, beside the coal-dusted buildings </P>
<P>that will adorn the innards of a gargantuan lake. What we haul </P>
<P>across our shoulders and breathe out is drifting with the river’s surface, </P>
<P>too, barely missing barges and coating the water with near-words. </P>
<P>It is a form of fjord, a means of holding the tongue against the teeth </P>
<P>in preparation for speech. I have never seen anything </P>
<P>like this balance of shore and current and so will myself to have </P>
<P>visual recall, using this profile as if it were the beginning of a familiar movie</P>
<P>to generate cues, nearly serial, nearly three thousand miles long.</P>

<P>The accusatory posture was accentuated with brows, arching </P>
<P>to voice a desire for the skeletal. Ready to admonish, fingers cocked, </P>
<P>we wrote barter systems in the minutes but did not follow up. </P>
<P>In each lyric was lyricism rendered by a sullen face, </P>
<P>by fatigue without armor, unable to tell the tale</P>
<P>and excuse crying wolf. Tomorrow we may strive for </P>
<P>the correct balance of pause and gesture, settle for learning how </P>
<P>to read the months as signals. Perhaps with a wave toward function</P>
<P>or with spread fingers hovering over the floorboards, or by assigning the unruly</P>
<P>monosyllabic names. And then to learn that your house is not </P>
<P>your house but a group of stances taken together to indicate tenancy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Yonder dry dry grasses</P>
</B>
<P>Yonder the meadows indicate signatures pressed into beach sand</P>
<P>somehow heaped between a twisted oak and soil spilled with the tides.</P>
<P>Tantalizing wind. We expected this momentum to be seamless</P>
<P>and all our preparations were as if we could rely on two remaining episodes </P>
<P>and details of their scripts. Changing the paper for the next day </P>
<P>ensures pretense will continue gently </P>
<P>but leveling the page and land requires a responsive interlace. </P>
<P>The envisioned means of coming true will either conjugate or fall. </P>
<P>We set that territory apart as if we meant it, leapt from bell towers when necessary </P>
<P>and craved happiness between times. I knew many of the streets and landmarks, </P>
<P>was prepared to climb and admire and enter into history </P>
<P>and its keeping, all for the sake, needing memory, </P>
<P>dallying over when to move on in the most comforted way possible.</P>

<P>The spaces skipped, the back would break, these can be fought </P>
<P>like the laboratory’s resemblance to heaven. The town cudgels </P>
<P>its place with the locals like salt. Quality and its issues </P>
<P>begin to curl when neglected, tendril-headed, a clear and graphic rule </P>
<P>that will provide per samplers and other offerings. </P>
<P>Weaving through crops in order to identify botanical names </P>
<P>we came to the dank pool where we hoped to see portraits but settled </P>
<P>for dislike. Rehearsals transmuted into performance, bodies arched </P>
<P>to fit over bicycle racks and shoes came untied. These </P>
<P>were the only things about us that adjusted to the new century. </P>
<P>As if giving could lend credence we gave and gave</P>
<P>while the water’s metallic taste affected vision and indicated a figure </P>
<P>silhouetted imprecisely where the pond had been drained.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A deed of title</P>
</B>
<P>When I came to understand myself as able, I sent word to the island</P>
<P>and nearly made it around before ownership changed and </P>
<P>distracted me into misinterpretation. Always abrupt, such transference,</P>
<P>but we will meet again where names are shortened and the familiar</P>
<P>is like a housepet swimming in its cage. Where the air thins </P>
<P>the earth takes another name, announces its frugality</P>
<P>despite a supply of views that will never dwindle. We leadenly swam</P>
<P>to an escalation and traced our shape in its paper wingspan.</P>
<P>Numbers of pebbles made up a stark beach below us, one by one </P>
<P>nearing the surf nigh upon a fortnight and an imminent bestseller.</P>

<P>This is the best reversal I have witnessed in recent memory</P>
<P>like skin split across the knuckles due to neglect rather than malice</P>
<P>or spring cleaning in another season. When an act is traditional</P>
<P>then who can argue with it? A little luck must fall whether or not</P>
<P>it mirrors the mood, not mired in the day-to-day or in response</P>
<P>to a legal claim but fraught with reflections. We lean on the power </P>
<P>of envelopment, of pretense, of weaving among the streetlights</P>
<P>ready to listen or sing. The loneliest night is still in dispute.</P>

<P>We reviewed but could not categorize the explorers, diplomats,</P>
<P>leaders of revolutions, and spouses. In some cases </P>
<P>tweaking made a slot. In others we simply signed off </P>
<P>and left the floaters in fluid. A sphere of land recalls the slope </P>
<P>of a chapel into a confessional booth and how sound catches my ear </P>
<P>as I release my hands. From his cupola one inventor generates </P>
<P>a pattern for traverse based on stellar observation, enhanced </P>
<P>with twinges in underused limbs. Another reason to take the stairs </P>
<P>is based on the sway of this building as we pass by </P>
<P>and how it interacts with discomfort before circumference </P>
<P>makes the circular out of a referent and into itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>The royal we</P>
</B>
<P>This new country beholds you from a tumult of routine </P>
<P>that will not adjust to communal living. Other people </P>
<P>are always looking for titles, but I wonder what to say</P>
<P>to avoid praise or reassurance and yet to speak. Never previously</P>
<P>would conundrum have described my language. The plush landscape</P>
<P>may become predatory, its redolent lust for camaraderie </P>
<P>counteracting the barren state covert within all green</P>
<P>neatly emptying into channels disguised by the hardy soils and stones.</P>

<P>Desensitized to travel, to trowels, to the assembly of uses </P>
<P>to be kept in a low cupboard as long as you keep limber, </P>
<P>we determine to esteem even as we age. I consider you indispensable </P>
<P>like the faint light of evening. Sudden affinities will guard us from </P>
<P>nostalgia and the ceremonies we encounter will not stop the months </P>
<P>from passing and the names from adapting to time. Sit together </P>
<P>and add on family with a generous hand, work the phrases hard</P>
<P>while leaping onto the bandwagon, full in song. Delight is supported and</P>
<P>maxims abound, searching for the lips of candidates. From the oracle</P>
<P>you moved to a stadium arrangement and I wept upon the setting</P>
<P>I ever pursue as if I really could live in it, wanting the lushness</P>
<P>as imagined under snow, the farmland without the reek of cow. </P>

<P>But I will not be a landlover who moves into the picturesque </P>
<P>as if it were simply a state without victims. That link wobbles</P>
<P>but retains its connection, the teeth of the snake cling </P>
<P>to its tail. When leaning into the street to avoid a train </P>
<P>we spot the news arriving at our door so know not to go home. </P>
<P>The announcement was to an audience clearly biased in favor </P>
<P>of having a bad time then dissembling. If I never before mentioned </P>
<P>my lurid past, it was to save you from yourself. When you flipped over </P>
<P>I declined to follow. Sensing an alert reception, my reluctance searches </P>
<P>for an illogical replacement before crossing the above-ground tracks. </P>
<P>We have realized too soon a breaking of knowledge. </P>
