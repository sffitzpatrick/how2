The project was initiated         on a manual typewriter one autumn when the prospect of moving loomed large         and nearly definite, when my professional obligations loomed equally large         and very definite, and when I had finished rereading Williamss <i>Kora         in Hell</i>. I took as my model Williamss writing process as he describes         it in his introduction to <i>Kora</i>; he wrote every night for a year         no matter the circumstances and revised the results into the poem. My         typewriter gave the act of writing a physicality that meshed with the         concerns of the writing; throughout the cycle place and replacement recur,         generated by motifs of structure and structuring, buildings and building.         <i>In Residence</i> was completed some months prior to my move and before         I knew where that move would land me, so the poems are acts of anticipation.         Their descriptions of place imagine the hunt for it, the method of finding         placement, the process of giving up a city where Id lived for a decade         even as I continued to live in it.<a name="top"></a></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Four poems from         <i>In Residence</i>:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="#accusation">An         accusation abetted</a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="#yonder">Yonder         dry dry grasses</a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="#deed">A         deed of title</a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="#royal">The         royal we</a></b></font></p>      <p><FONT FACE="Palatino"><BR>        </font></p>      <FONT FACE="Palatino">       <HR>      <BR>      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><BR>      </font></font>       <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a name="accusation"></a>An         accusation abetted</b></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When you refuse me         stories because of slight variance<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I cannot clear         a space for lightning.
