        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is the opening 
        of a story that will be published in Don Berger's magazine <i>My Friends</i>. 
        I wrote it over the course of a month, listening compulsively to Dawn 
        Upshaw sing Gorecki's &quot;Third Symphony.&quot; I was wondering what 
        really alters in us, with time, and whether there isn't some part, given 
        certain circumstances, that remains as it was years and years ago. The 
        story is a dream about that, I suppose.</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="top"></a></font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        was born an infant, a child I became, and a child I am now, after these 
        thirty-six years of life. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why 
        I have not developed as others have, why this body has remained the body 
        it was some thirty years ago, and whether I will die a child still in 
        a childish smocked dress, red shoes --, these things I do not know. I 
        have read many books and have not found the answers there.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years ago, physicians spent much time ministering 
        to me, in vain attempts to cure; scientists much time attempting to discover 
        the laws of the science which operates somewhere within me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay quietly then beneath their hands and knives, 
        saving my tears, and time passed as they tapped and probed, rolled me 
        on my table through long fluorescent tunnels; time passed as their needles 
        drew blood, gave fluid; and in time I saw their curiosity and awe change 
        to frustration, dislike, perhaps even disgust: time passed and their white 
        coats drooped at the shoulders, the learned heads bent, they did not now 
        look into the blood and bone with the same close verve they had once exhibited; 
        now, they turned their backs and closed the steel cases bearing the calibrated 
        instruments, and now they sighed, and the light in the room was dim, and 
        it hurt my eyes to keep them open, and <br>
        whereas once these men and women had spoken clearly now they mumbled, 
        and they no doubt thought of home, as we all do when tired, and of their 
        families, the children whose limbs grew correctly on schedule, whose bodies 
        thickened and thinned in the proper places, and they looked forward to 
        stepping into their houses, that evening, they looked forward to resuming 
        the difficulties of life en famille, as they say in a foreign phrase. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at me now. I have been called dwarf, 
        midget: I am neither. I have not so much aged as been carried impeccably 
        forward by time; you will find no lines on my face or hands; my fingernails 
        are the thin iridescent nails of a young child. In this country which 
        adores youth I am young beyond adoration; it is as if the country went 
        to sleep and dreamed badly, and I stepped out of the dream.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is many years now since I allowed myself 
        the words: What if it had been... what if I.... One must somehow live. 
        Yet from time to time, against my will, those phrases present themselves 
        without being sought, like a melody that appears suddenly after years 
        and years, carrying with it, it seems, another time....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        knew my mother as the sole member of my family, and she attempted various 
        schemes, while she could, to draw comfort from the calamity of my person, 
        generally preferring, of course, her comfort in the form of dollars. In 
        a large blue Chrysler we set out one summer, touring on exhibit. I was 
        twenty-one; public interest in my case had waned some long time ago. We 
        drove toward the middle of the country, as my mother had the impression 
        people there were ill-informed; she appeared to believe television and 
        newspapers had never passed the great frontier plains of Ohio: she believed, 
        in short, that I was news for which people would pay.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the western edge of Ohio we stopped 
        in Fort Recovery, a town which did not live up to its name, and she found 
        on the single, tattered outskirt of that place a sign painter who agreed 
        to paint my portrait, full-length, upon each of the car's two doors. He 
        took a photograph of me, not without some trouble: my mother had the idea 
        that I should be painted <i>from life,</i> as she kept saying. Will it 
        cost more to do her <i>from life?</i> I'd like them really to <i>see</i> 
        what she looks like. Aren't all the good portraits done <i>from life?</i> 
        Now look, if I stand her here....<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited until Mother paused to draw breath 
        and then he held up the paint-spattered camera and said sullenly, This 
        <i>is </i>from life. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked for two days on the job. I am a rarity 
        but I am not pretty, and the man's art did not improve my looks. The faint 
        ridge under the car's windows defined the top of my head as a square; 
        my long braids were rendered as leaden pipes; this narrow face became 
        longer set on the curve of the door, and although the painter told me 
        to smile when he took my picture and I did, the portrait showed a person, 
        or rather, child, whose wit had departed days ago and who now stood dully, 
        mouth open, as if listening to incomprehensible commands. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to this character, who sported a pink 
        frothy dress (a figment of the painter's imagination -- he must have grouped 
        all feminine trappings under the heading Bubble Bath), waved a gold banner 
        on which was lettered in black gothic script the motto of my mother's 
        brainstorm: UNAGING MIRACLE . <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must at some point have recounted the 
        drama of my condition, for when the job had been approved and the painter 
        had his money in his hand, he winked at me. I guess we're all stuck someways, 
        he said. He picked up a jar from the board holding his paints and took 
        a long drink. Thank him, my mother said in a stage whisper, and she opened 
        the car door and pushed me in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        Indiana Mother parked at the edge of a strip mall and pondered the mystery 
        of theatrical space, how to create it. She had sung in a choir as a girl, 
        up on the stage of the school auditorium, but that event had not prepared 
        her for the venue she now considered. She determined in any case that 
        what she lacked in experience she would make up for with enthusiasm, and 
        drapes: in a yardgoods store lengths of shiny sky-blue material, of scarlet, 
        were purchased. With a hammer and tacks she hung the blue in the back 
        windows of the car: the loose, looping folds hinted strangely at canopy 
        beds, powder puffs, enticing privacies of the boudoir or, perhaps, of 
        the hearse. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the [test] attraction itself, she paid to 
        have fabricated a stand of rather ingenious design, whose square platform 
        lifted, telescoping out into three tiers of hinged wood. From the bottom 
        tier rose four retractable poles, and from a line running through the 
        tops of these my mother hung scarlet satin flocked by lines of velvet 
        fleurs-de-lis. Where she came by the money for these elaborations, I do 
        not know. It was not, in any case, for me to ask questions, it was rather 
        for me to be silent and stand on the platform, hidden by the dense cloth 
        that surrounded me, separated from my public and cooler air until that 
        time when I heard my mother proclaim, <i>I will now unveil,</i>-- and 
        she paused-- <i>the world's only Unaging Miracle,</i> and then she drew 
        back the front panels, and I opened my arms and turned, with a gentle 
        tapping of my white patent-leather shoes, in a circle first one way and 
        then the other while my mother told the story of science's failure to 
        follow my body across the frontier it was traversing. She wove into my 
        story other tales of the unknown: aspects of the planet Pluto which no 
        one has ever seen; her own mother who was born without an appendix and 
        upon whose lovely arms and legs hair had never sprouted; then on to her 
        lack of suspicion during my seventh and eighth years when she and my teachers 
        thought I was "just a bit" slow; famous hospitals I had frequented; moment 
        of stupendous realization; mysteries of the atom; failure of menses to 
        occur; this monologue ending with finesse on a list of questions designed 
        to stir her audience to a consideration of all they did not know: what 
        happened to the dinosaurs? how did Jesus arrange the loaves and fishes? 
        where is the end of the universe? if a dog could talk what would it say? 
        and, finally, what is the nature of a dream?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was naive but intelligent, and 
        I always appreciated her refusal in this speech of the chicken or egg 
        conundrum. Her reliance on matters involving the planets, however, made 
        me dizzy. I stood in the heat, there on the platform, imagining the endless 
        dark of space, how one was tinier in comparison than the smallest speck 
        of the finest dust, how one could fall into the dark, and fall irretrievably, 
        life lost, all connection severed except the primary one, the one between 
        body and the void, that connection from which comes all instruction and 
        all anxiety, and the faces of my public wavered before me, the children 
        in front with open mouths and trusting eyes, the large, polite, blond 
        women and men, and my knees went weak and I stuttered in movement as I 
        tapped a thank you and gave a curtsey, and then the curtain was replaced, 
        and I stood alone, staring at the fuzzy scarlet fleurs-de-lis, while my 
        mother answered questions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She encountered, of course and as I had 
        predicted, a serious problem: resembling a normal six-year old, being 
        in no overt way a freak, I made a better story than spectacle. The miracle 
        did not show itself in the moment, so to speak, but over time, and many 
        mild, skeptical voices rose that summer: <i>How do we know she's not just 
        a kid? She looks like a kid to me. </i>I had suggested I be allowed to 
        answer questions; my mother felt that would complicate matters, and tried 
        instead to allay doubt by exhibiting a birth certificate; she held up 
        newspaper articles documenting the case, and pinned to a folding easel 
        a series of dated photographs which seemed worthless, for there I was 
        in each, wearing different clothes but otherwise unaltered, the whole 
        sequence suggesting a primitive fashion show rather than time's progress.... 
        Perhaps if the pictures had been taken outside, by trees, showing the 
        season....Or if Mother had stood next to me, aging across the years while 
        I remained, like a figure more plastic than human, as I was, as I was, 
        as I am.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this was in the Midwest and only once 
        or twice did anyone press my mother beyond the initial, questioning exchange.
