In the 1980s, journals         such as <i>HOW(ever)</i> put the spotlight on these issues, particularly         as related to innovative or experimental practices and how these intersected         with issues of publication, erasure, and canon formation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A decade later, we         find ourselves trying to define a vocabulary for addressing complex issues         of class in the formation of an innovative poetics. As Kathy Lou Schultz         asked in her <i>Tripwire</i> (N.1, Fall 1998 &amp; appearing in this issue         of HOW2) essay, "What's a working class poetic, and where could I find         one?" How do we make present the "absence" of class in discussions of         gender and the poetics of innovation? Where are the intersections of race         in discussions of class? How are these forces fused or CON-fused?</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How do/can we picture/trace         working class issues in formally innovative ways? What do the circumstances         of literary production &#8211; surrounding writers and the writing produced         &#8211; have to do with one another?"</font></p>      <FONT FACE="Palatino"><BR>      </font><FONT FACE="Palatino">       <HR>      </font>       <p align="CENTER"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>HOW2         Forum: Class &amp; Innovative Writing</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><img src="../../pictures/bobbie.jpg" width="134" height="141" align="left" alt="Bobbie West"><a name="west"></a>BOBBIE         WEST</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Defining "class"         and "working class poetry"</font></p>      <hr width="250" align="left">      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The space provided         by this forum is hardly large enough even to name the beast, let alone         to say something significant about it. And "working class" may be too         narrow a term to use here, when what we're really talking about are perceptions         of various states of suppression and exclusion. The term I prefer is "lower         classes" (emphasis on the plural), which includes not only people of urban         working class backgrounds, but also the chronically unemployed and the         rural poor, who have certain life circumstances and expectations in common,         as well as some common aesthetic preferences.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When it comes to         literary production, class pervades every aspect of it. For people of         the lower classes, the common denominator is "have-not" status, starting         with the glaring absence of the middle/upper class assumption that it         is always possible to achieve what one desires. There's a lack of cash         to support money-losing ventures such as poetry magazines and small presses         (owner/editorship of which gives one instant recognition). There's a lack         of access to the Internet, where one can hobnob with publishers and magazine         editors (publication being determined partly by who you know: For example,         this particular essay appearing in this particular forum is a result of         having met someone [Kathy Lou Schultz] at an academic conference and having         contributed to an Internet discussion).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">An even more basic         lack is that of access to the kind of education that can equip one with         an understanding of which particular aesthetic modes of thought and presentation         are valued and which are not, an education that trains one to produce         in those modes, while also providing the skills needed to innovate and         rebel against them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even if one achieves         access to these things, there are still difficulties. Whose aesthetic         values should an individual lower class poet be willing to accept? While         disjunctive techniques seem to be commonly enjoyed and employed by all         contemporary poetic "innovators," I've noticed some differences in other         aesthetic components that seem to fall along the old academic/non-academic         (and therefore also class) lines. For example, why does the tone of so         many "innovative" poetry</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">         magazines seem to be dominated by an intellectual, white-sounding verbal         style, with lots of iambs and not much syncopation? Why are emotion, pathos,         and melodrama (of which I am quite fond, and which fondness I believe         is due in part to a lower class background) discounted, while philosophical         conundrums are praised? Why shouldn't we be free to utilize the full range         of expression available to us as human beings &#8211; the emotional and particular         as well as the abstract and philosophical, cacophonous as well as harmonious?         Must all of our poetic endeavors "reek of brains" (as a friend once put         it) in order to be valued? </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Questions like those         lead to the one asked by the editors of this forum: "What is 'working         class' poetry?" For me, it's all of the poetry, whether mainstream or         avant garde, written by people who identify themselves as working class,         particularly when it deals with the dynamics of economic and cultural         power hierarchies and their effects on us as a class (and as individuals),         and that expresses our resistance to them. I, as an individual, tend to         prefer innovative styles of poetry because they can so effectively express         the sense of disconnectedness, disturbance, distortion, difficulty, and         disaffection that often results from life in the lower classes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bobbie West grew         up on a farm in Illinois. After drifting into various jobs as a waitress,         union machinist, teacher, and translator, she discovered poetry.

She's         the author of a chapbook, <i>Scattered Damage</i> (Meow Press, 1998),         and assistant editor of <i>A Wild Salience: the Writing of Rae Armantrout,</i>         forthcoming from Burning Deck Press.

For the         past 20 years this community has nourished and incensed me. Any ideas         I have about class in my own writing are framed by my class experience         within this community, a community whose class politics I don't have much         good to say about. Presenting my critique of (my fantasy of) this middle         class writing scene, I fear, is a losing proposition. "She's such a whiner,"         people will scoff. I've seen this happen time and again when such critiques         come up on the SUNY Buffalo Poetics List. I, and many other working class         people, have been helped by this scene (trained, given access and encouragement)         but treated badly by it as well (kept on the peripheries, tolerated rather         than accepted, denied difference). This treatment has a different flavor         than the coddling and patronizing writers of color endure. Being working         class is like being fat. It's your own fault. You'd do something about         it if you really cared about yourself.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When I was a young         writer I went through a rigorous period of training. My manner and public         presentation, as well as my writing, were minutely critiqued. "Writing         is a middle class occupation," a Marxist friend told me. "If you want         to be a writer, Dodie, you've got to learn to be more middle class." Another         mentor volunteered that my brown eyeliner was too harsh. "D. and I have         been discussing your eyeliner, and we think that green might work better."         I feel a lot of anger about this interaction&#8211;particularly when I'm in         PMS and thrashing about for something to obsess about. An appalling overtness         that resonates with the thousands of other more covert messages received         in the past twenty years. I see bald, disapproving moon-heads, straight         out of a Sylvia Plath poem. They scowl at my social coarseness, my primitive,         black and white value system&#8211;the way I pouted and scoffed when my teachers         suggested I make friends with people who will "do you some good." This         standard operating procedure in a community that's jousting for power         is dishonest in a working class context, where there is so little power         to be had. It's not like you never see such "networking" there, but it         is considered BAD. I tend to think of middle class people as immoral and         fussy. "Corn cobs stuck up there asses," as my mother would say.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whenever I see a         cheap (white) woman on the street&#8211;not some trendoid doing cheapness,         but a really unselfconsciously cheap woman&#8211;I get a sexual thrill, I stare         and stare at her blue eyeshadow, her inch-long rhinestoned nails, lipstick         stained cigarette, hairspray, too tight jeans, pasty cleavage, my eyeballs         bulge with staring. Lacy thong bikini, I'm sure of it. My "novel" <i>The         Letters of Mina Harker,</i> is the place where I get to be that cheap         woman&#8211;if she had a voice, if she had years of training. Mina is a place         where I get to rip loose, to be vulgar, unruly, to shit all over everything,         to wail like a hysterical baby, to brandish the hatchet humor I was raised         with. Much of the permission for wallowing in all this primalness comes         from Lacanian theory. In Mina my Lacanian desire is twofold: I wanted         to both enact the delicious twistedness of his theories and to subvert         previous "prissy" feminist enactments. At this point, however, I can make         no clean separation between these feminists and me&#8211;neither inside nor         outside of my writing. Compared to the women I was raised with, I've become         "prissy" myself. One cannot spend one's entire adult life living and working         among a middle class intelligentsia without being tainted. Clashings and         slippages of class codes generate energy, excitement. Look at Audrey Hepburn         in movie after movie, madly changing from flower girl to lady, from bookseller         to supermodel, from chauffeur's daughter to millionaire's wife, from farm         wife to bohemian, from princess to vacationing nobody. If Audrey stayed         put, nothing interesting would ever happen to her! Gowns by Edith Head,         romance by Gregory Peck, book by Hard Press, fountains by Rome. It's all         been worth it, I tell myself.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dodie Bellamy is         the author of <i>The Letters of Mina Harker </i>(Hard Press, 1998).

An artificially         divided strata arose from this world view, and a "demand for menial labor"         became paramount. Under such an auspices a select few were automatically         absolved of the ulterior puzzle of day-to-day sustainment. But for the         vast majority the issue of hunger and general dearth has maintained itself         as the mantra of a negative epic. And it is within this epic that the         majority of the populace in the West has been born.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the 1760s onward         a working class has evolved from the industrial epoch. A class, worked         to its teeth in order to maintain a modicum of raiment and shelter.

Inner radiance cannot         be curtailed by the stones one has to sup with one's bread. One can look         at Rimbaud or Blake, at Cesaire or Bob Kaufman, to see that the mind cannot         be contained within the provinces of hunger. And this is not to say that         the reality of poverty has no life in letters, or that the imagination         is elitist. By no means. But what I speak of is the imaginal power to         leap beyond the brutally imposed confines to combat the bureaucracies         with an elemental seismics, with a new and alien thinking.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Will Alexander's         latest book is <i>Above the Human Nerve Domain</i> (Pavement </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Saw         Press).

As Alice Notley says in her introduction to Berrigan's selected         poems, "Ted came from a working class background and was very realistic         about choices in America. You weren't poor if you had gone to college.         On the other hand, you would not get certain kinds of poetic recognition         in your lifetime if you had gone to Something State instead of Harvard."         Or as Pierre Bourdieu puts it, "Cultural objects, with their subtle hierarchy,         are predisposed to mark the stages and degrees of initiatory progress         which define the enterprise of </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">culture."         A Working Class Avant Garde poetic would be the product of poems and publishing         practices that would find itself on the bottom of that subtle hierarchy.         But, dear Reader, Bourdieu comes to the rescue: Drawing on the historic         practices of "the learned of all religions" and their "treatment of canonical         texts," Bourdieu tells us that, "since the levels of 'reading' designate         hierarchies of readers, it is necessary and sufficient to change the hierarchy         of readings in order to overturn the hierarchies of readers."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Marx, as in Reality,         the Working Class is defined in relation to Capital as those who must         sell their labor. In poetry this labor is often offered humbly to those         who went to Harvard and not Something State. Here Working Class Avant         Gardists can learn from none other than T.S. Eliot: "Can we regret...that         Francois Villon did not choose to mix with more respectable society, or         that Robert Burns did not have the same schooling as Dr. Johnson?" It         might seem strange to quote Eliot, a man now condemned to centuries of         fame as the librettist for the longest running Broadway musical of the         20th Century, to support a call for Working Class Avant Garde practices.         But he basically got this one right. Villon and Burns didn't write for         professors or other commissars. In other words, any Avant Garde that seeks         approval of other Avant Gardes isn't Avant Garde (there are no Avant Gardian         Angels). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the SUNY Buffalo         Poetics List not long ago, a Working Class poet [Kathy Lou Schultz] intervened         in a debate on class and poetry and said in passing that she could "smell         class." For this she was chastised by another listmember who seemed to         assume that the WC poet was actually UC and thus looking down on the odoriferous         huddled masses. I found the rebuke itself to indicate a distinctively         privileged assumption, one that could only be made by someone with in-born         access to the dominant class and who thus assumed that class differences         were only manifested by those BELOW. Rank has its privileges.

It is in the last         of these that poetry might find its real grounding in class, since poetry         is a form of work. Ironically, the rigors of traditional, rhymed, formalist         poetry displayed a stronger trace of the hand of the workman: the sheer         artificiality of a <i>canzone</i> working off ten matched rhymes highlights         a labor intensiveness which can disappear into the foreignness of a more         abstracted avant-garde. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is a sculpture         by the artist Robert Morris entitled "Box Containing the Sound of Its         Own Making." The viewer approaches a decidedly plain wooden crate, closed         on all sides, to find that it is emitting a racket of hammering, sawing,         and the incidental sounds of construction. Those sounds come from a tape         recording playing inside the box, a recording of the accidental noise         that went into building the artwork.

The latter belies the         overarching poetical rhetoric of the former, but also underscores the         material (class) conditions of the poet-manufacturer responsible, especially         owing to the humble or even "lower class" nature of the expenses ("$2.14         </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Doritos, OJ").         Possibilities such as these begin to offer instances of how a post-modern         poetry might acknowledge the constructedness of the poem, and the role         of the poet as laborer in a cottage industry factory of verse.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BIO:</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jeffrey Jullich has         been published in <i>Shiny, Caliban, Pavement, College English,</i> <i>ACM</i>         <i>(Another Chicago Magazine)</i>,<i> Poetry,</i> and elsewhere.

In addition,         poor and working-class writers may not know how one goes about publishing         one's work, or how to promote it. They may never see a living, breathing,         published writer, much less get to know one. The lack of social/psychological         support for their writing will usually also curtail the amount of writing         accomplished. It is also hard to persist in asserting that writing is         your work when the people around you define "work" as physical labor.         In essence, a working-class writer writes without a role model, a mentor,         or economic or psychological support.

Feminism was content if you were going to make         a feminist poem recognizable to feminists or to the avant garde.

But they certainly were, because they brought feminism         over the great divide from content to form. Once a critical mass of writing         (and assuming) had been achieved, people no longer said that women were         not making something new, and "suddenly" disjunct form could be feminist         poetics.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I don't think I could         look at a page of words and say, Oh, a working class form. A working class         poetics must claim part of what is already there, apply it to the disjunctions         and silences of class, and build a poetry that brings new meanings and         new applications to innovative form.

Can this moment of silence also         be a moment of power? I doubt it. If there is to be a poetics of class,         it may be founded on the abjection and dissonance that inform genre-bending         writing by, say, Lawrence Braithwaite, Camille Roy, and Dodie Bellamy.         Are writers, perhaps unknown to each other, already creating a body of         work?
