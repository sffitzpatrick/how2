I have tried to reconstruct from my notes (which admittedly         got more hieroglyphic, as it were, over the course of our week).

We see,           for example, in &quot;Eurydice,&quot; all colors in the poem (which           ends with the &quot;white&quot; of all colors, also a code word for           homosexual) to a mystic rainbow. <br>          <br>          </font></li>        <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Specific textuality           and intertextuality of H.D. Collecott disagrees with those critics (cf.           Peter Jay, Agenda) who dismiss Sappho&#39;s relevance to H.D. and contends           that, in identifying the Sapphic fragments and what they&#39;re doing in           H.D.'s work, we shouldn&#39;t overlook Susan Gubar&#39;s foundational essay,           &quot;Sapphistries&quot;: Also Kathleen Fraser&quot;s notion: &quot;in           fragment lies potency.&quot; Akin to Pound&quot;s &quot;luminous detail.&quot;</font></li>      </ul>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;H.D. favors the         margins, the borders, the scattered within Western tradition (Lesbos,         Cornwall, we said, where women would go for a time to create &quot;space         and time&quot; for their creativity, their work, &quot;their culture&quot;).         Poetry is the site of transformation (we discussed H.D.'s signifying on         Sappho and hermeticism as a kind of Gatesian &quot;signifyin&#39;&quot;).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Ailsa Holland         then raised the question of whether it&#39;s possible to read H.D. as a political         poet. She identified two types of narrative in this regard: narrative         of threat and narrative of redemption. She analysed the animal imagery         in H.D.'s prose, reflecting the rise of Fascism. Ezra was a daemonic panther,         Britain the proverbial lion, and Nazis, for example, were often configured         as packs of wolves (doing much disservice to real wolves, one might add).         Narratives of redemption bound up with child imagery for H.D. (Moses in         the bullrushes was Freud in <i>Tribute to Freud</i> but messianic narratives         also found in Hitler&#39;s self-figuration). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Thus, with regard         to the politics of her day, H.D. is highly ambivalent, both because she  plays with ambivalence and ambiguity (in her use of puns, for example),         but she was also so privileged, with a tendency to rationalize Pound&quot;s         sympathy for Fascism, that she is an ambivalent figure herself. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<i>getherpieces</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Day 2</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Eibhlin Evans         discussed Frances Gregg, and H.D. with reference to Gregg&#39;s recently published         <i>The Mystic Leeway. </i>Gregg writes an amalgomous text&#8211;part memoir,         part philosophical musing, part sermon. She found the Modernists escapists,         and yet herself was terrified of having such a commitment to art as H.D.         Gregg argues for an intelligence based on love (<i>agape</i> rather than         <i>eros</i>, however) and compassionate giving, asserting that intelligence         comes from suffering. We learned many facts about her life with H.D.,         and after, but for them both, their early relationship was significant         and definitive. EE raised interesting questions about the degree of self-mythologizing         both in Gregg&#39;s self portrait of tireless altruism and in terms of class         issues.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Next Zara Bruzzi         discussed Artemis and early bear worship as providing another approach         to understanding H.D.&#39;s <i>Her</i> (Artemis as the protectress of an inner         space that ought to be inviolable!).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Artemis as: female         autonomy</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Athena as: wisdom         and intelligence</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;ZB discussed         the Apollo and Daphne myth as an illustration of how this early cult is         evident in late myths: Daphne is covered in bark which is analogous, ZB         speculated, to bear skin: PROTECTION, A GIRL&#39;S AUTONOMY AGAINST INVASION.         In &quot;Hymen,&quot; for example, the girls are figures in a Diana cult:         &quot;bear girls&quot;&#8211; Artemesian fantasy is re-visioning in H.D.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Frances Gregg goes         for mother/ child figure of lesbian relationship; </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">H.D. for girl/ girl,         for Artemesian clain (whole yet double).</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>&#9;&#9;and             frag</i></font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>ments, blue             on blue &#8211; Jul</i></font></p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Day 3</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yoshiko Kita: H.D.&#39;s         early poems and nature writing</font></p>      <p> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;not the idea         about the thing but the thing itself&quot; doesn&#39;t apply to H.D., whose         poems, YK argued, are phenomenological in nature.

Because         we think in classification, observed Harriet. She disagrees with people         who say that generic structures don't matter. She mentioned Bakhtinian         generic &quot;contracts,&quot; and noted that generic theorists no longer         view genre as a pre-existing slot. Gender theorists also no longer view         gender as stable (for example, Judith Butler). When H.D. refers to her         own work, she does not describe it as generically located. H.T. had a         handout on this, but to give a brief example, she quoted H.D., who called         <i>Helen in Egypt</i> not her epic or her long poem but &quot;the Helen         sequence,&quot; i.e. substituting &quot;sequence&quot; for &quot;epic&quot;         or &quot;long poem.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;H.T. argues that         H.D. was generically very multiple, that she blurs genres. In her work,         genres cut across each other, whether in the early lyrics, middle prose,         or late epics. Rachel Blau DuPlessis, for example, tried to describe <i>Paint         It Today</i> as follows: &quot;Hawthorne-influenced lesbian novel-essay&quot;;         Susan Stanford Friedman described H.D.'s Madrigal cycle and <i>Tribute         to Freud</i> as &quot;case histories.&quot;</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<i>ords,         scraps (I</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Next, Kathy Hopewell         spoke on narration and focalisation in <i>Kora and Ka</i>, with particular         reference to H.D.&#39;s involvement in film and contemporary theories of &quot;the         gaze.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kora is a redemptive         figure. Ka is from the <i>Egyptian Book of the Dead</i>. It is the spirit         that comes out from the dead (Ba being the body). In H.D.&#39;s text, Ka is         associated with a fixed viewpoint, aggressive and possibly ambivalently         gendered. The Ka prevents Helforth from distinguishing between himself         and others. He did not go to war, but lost his brothers in WWI. The Kora         (within him?) resists the Ka. Helforth&#39;s neurosis may be because he has         not proved himself in war. He dissociates, and breaks down.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;<i>fl could stir</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kathy argued that         H.D.&#39;s <i>Closeup</i> reviews investigate the relationship of women to         film (see, for instance, Dreyer&#39;s <i>Jeanne D&#39;Arc</i>, see also H.D. on         Garbo&#39;s <i>Joy Street</i>.

Julia wants to enter         the public realm as a speaking and writing subject, because she sees women&#39;s         biology as a trap (motherhood, old maid, prostitute) and art as an escape         from this trap.

She usefully         reviewed Freud and Lacan, then raised the question of H.D.&#39;s identification         process and altruism. Was she narcissistic, SM asked? Can we reclaim the         ego (social) ideal from its pejorative (male-dominated) context? SM talked         about the relationship between visual and verbal self-portraiture and         the shifting eyes/I&#39;s in H.D. She posed the issue of how we represent         ourselves and referred to Charles Sanders Peirce&#39;s semeiotics: signs as         mode of representation (icon/index/symbol). </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">SM suggested that         H.D.&#39;s work casts light on the emergence of the ego, and reader-writer         identification. Her playful poetics emulates primary processes; her pluralistic         poetics of wordplay unravels the conformable pastiche of the ego. The         poetic unravelling takes us with her through the changes of self. This         process of self transformation takes us back through mystical Moravian         roots to its own roots in pre-Christian Goddess worship. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">H.D.&#39;s drive for         greater knowledge: What is it to be a woman (writer)?

We watched a gorgeous full sunset           that evening: the sun kind of squashed, a squashed orange ball between           clouds, flattening out a bit as it dipped and then sank into a luminous,           blue sea. We stood in a long row, spellbound, bound by a spell, rapt           and wrapped-up in watching, all with half-smiles, a line of Mona Lisas           along the sea&#39;s edge.
