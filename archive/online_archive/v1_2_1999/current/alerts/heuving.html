Central to this volume and to understanding         (Riding) Jackson's entire career is her concept of the "individual-unreal"         or "unreal self," developed in her essay "Jocasta," named for the erased         and contaminated mother of the Oedipus myth. (Riding) Jackson, who felt         that existing social orders belied the self, postulated through her concept         of an "unreal self," an entity apart from these orders. Indeed, the "individual-unreal"         or the "unreal self" might be seen as the rejecting substratum of the         self that would change the terms of its existence. (Riding) Jackson writes,         "In every person there is the possibility of a small, pure, new, unreal         portion which is, without reference to personality in the popular, social         sense, self. I use 'self' in no romantic connotation, but only because         it is the most vivid word I can find for this particular purefaction."         As (Riding) Jackson put it, the "unreal is to me poetry." (Jackson, <i>Anarchism</i>,         96, 99)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;From (Riding)         Jackson's perspective, most twentieth-century writing was an art of the         "individual-real" and was compelled by "the nostalgic desire to reconstitute         an illusory whole that has no integrity but the integrity of accident"         (<i>Anarchism</i>, 104). Such an art was hopelessly "synthetic": "imitative,         communicative, provocative of association." In contrast a poetry of the         "individual-unreal" was "analytic" &quot;original, dissociative and provocative         of dissociation" (<i>Anarchism</i>, 115). (Riding) Jackson comments:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The end of poetry             is to leave everything as pure and bare as possible after its operation.             It is therefore important that its tools of destruction should be             as frugal, economical as possible. When the destruction or analysis             is accomplished they shall have to account for their necessity; they             are the survivors, the result as well as the means of elimination...The             greater the clutter attacked and the smaller, the purer, the residue             to which it is reduced (the more destructive the tools), the better             the poem. (<i>Anarchism</i>, 117)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps more than         any other poet of the twentieth century (Riding) Jackson works to negate         the narcissistic and idealizing psychic economies and the signifying practices         that underwrite them, so critical for most literature, especially poetry.         The last two pieces in <i>Anarchism Is Not Enough</i>, "The Damned Thing"         and "Letter of Abdication," show both the range of (Riding) Jackson's         pastiche and the force of her social critique. In "The Damned Thing,"         (Riding) Jackson analyzes the production of sexuality within civilization,         dismissing literary sensibilities as deeply implicated in such a production.         As she saw it, man's "phallus proud-works-of art" amount to little more         than man's "private play with [woman] in public" (<i>Anarchism</i>, 208,         205). Indeed, sexuality has been overwritten by a civilization uncomfortable         with it. The king pin of this system is women's "sexual impersonality"         that "if not philosophized, would wreck the solemn masculine machine"         (<i>Anarchism</i>, 196). Importantly her target for attack is neither         men nor sexuality, but the ways sexual desire has been produced through         an "insidious, civilized traffic." In its civilized version, sexuality         is produced as a kind of rare brew of bodily impulses, scientific phrases,         and literary sentiments, which all conspire to keep women in a passive         state. (Riding) Jackson parodies "the diffusion which modern society calls         love," revealing how a man's "I love you" speech is constituted:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My sexual glands             by the ingrowing enlargement of my sex instinct since childhood and             its insidious, civilized traffic with every part of my mental and             physical being, are unfortunately in a state of continual excitement.             I have very good control of myself, but my awareness of your sexual             physique and its radiations was so acute that I could not resist the             temptation to desire to lie with you. Please do not think this ignoble             of me, for I shall perform this act, if you permit it, with the greatest             respect and tenderness and attempt to make up for the indignity it             of course fundamentally will be to you (however pleasurable) by serving             you in every possible way and by sexually flattering manifestations             of your personality which are not strictly sexual. </font></p>          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">(<i>Anarchism</i>,             189)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In the concluding         piece of <i>Anarchism Is Not Enough</i>, "Letter of Abdication," an autocratic         "I" or "Queen" abdicates her authority, impugning a "you," her audience.         The fictional extravaganza is a virtual extinguishing of narcissistic         and idealizing psychological relations that might animate relations between         such a Queen and her entourage. She upbraids her audience, "You are sticky         instead of rubbery. You represent yourself with priggish sincerity instead         of mimicking yourself with grotesque accuracy" (<i>Anarchism</i>, 209).         She further condemns, "You know only how to be either heroes or cowards.         But you do not know how to outwit yourselves by being neither, though         seeming to be both. 'What,' you say indignantly, 'would you have us be         nothing?' Ah, my dear people, if you could you would all shortly become         Queens" (<i>Anarchism</i>, 224). In the conclusion of the piece, the autocratic         "I" flounces out, "Good-bye. I am going back to my mirror, where I came         from" (<i>Anarchism</i>, 224). In this perverse writing, it is fitting         that the Queen should exit with such finality into a mirror, as she has         so thoroughly denounced all mirroring relations.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;While (Riding)         Jackson's early writing is importantly excessive in its modes of over-         statement, her poetry is decidedly spare and economical. Valuing at this         time her poetry more highly than any of her other writing, (Riding) Jackson         equates its intellectual shaping with the very existence of a "real":</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is a sense             of life so real that it becomes the sense of something more real than             life...It introduces a principle of selection into the undifferentiating             quantitative appetite and thus changes accidental emotional forms             into deliberate intellectual forms...It is the meaning at work in             what has no meaning; it is, at its clearest, poetry. (Jackson, <i>Contemporaries</i>,             9)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In the poem "Be         Grave, Woman," the speaker in search of a new "real" negates existing         love scenarios.

Only by passing through a "grave" woman and         her "stark mind" will this changed love be possible. While some critics         have mistakenly seen (Riding) Jackson's emphasis on the mind throughout         her work as making her a "philosophical poet," an epithet that (Riding)         Jackson herself abjured, importantly her emphasis on the mind is rather         on what the mind enacts, its intellectual judgments, and negations.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Few, if any writers,         can equal the extreme ferocity and spare bleakness of (Riding) Jackson's         early writings. However, Kathy Acker comes to mind, albeit differently.         If (Riding) Jackson aims to negate existing love economies of idealism         and narcissism, Acker explores these <i>ad nauseam</i>. At once evoking         and deflating these economies through disclosure of their sado-masochistic         dimensions, Acker combines mytho-poetic modes with flattened non-sequiturs.         Lyrical effusions amplify the rationalized languages of an industrialized         society and the sound bite logics of newspeak. Acker begins <i>Don Quixote         </i>with an overview of its heroic quest:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When she was             finally crazy because she was about to have an abortion, she conceived             of the most insane idea that any woman can think of. Which is to love.             How can a woman love? By loving someone other than herself. She would             love another person. By loving another person, she would right every             manner of political, social, and individual wrong; she would put herself             in those situations so perilous the glory of her name would resound.             The abortion was about to take place. (Acker, 9)</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Initially undertaking         a line of feminine reasoning, love will save the world and bring honor         to the woman, the narrational tone abruptly shifts as a kind of <i>deus         ex machina </i>comes down: "The abortion was about to take place."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Throughout the         opening pages of <i>Don Quixote</i>, an abortion, technically the demise         of love-making, functions as the mock heroic event by which this knight         can gain her "knighthood / nighthood." The term 'abortion,' a particularly         ugly denomination for a 'woman's right to choose,' introduces the possibility         of complex psychological and linguistic operations, such as castration         and negation, which are, in turn, negated through the flattened naming         of the event. Modern day hospital technologies shift into memories of         Don Quixote's sixteenth century misfortunes and other epochal landscapes         of despair:</font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">They told her             they were going to take her from the operating chair to her own bed             in a wheeling chair. The wheeling chair would be her transportation.             She went out to look at it. It was dying. It had once been a hack,             the same as all the hacks on grub street; now, as all the hacks, was             a full-time drunk, mumbled all the time about sex but now no longer             not even never did it but didn't have the wherewithal or equipment             to do it, and hung around with the other bums. That is, women who're             having abortions.

Just as 'Hackneyed' is the glorification             or change from non-existence into existence of Hack-kneed,' so, she             decided, 'catheter' is the glorification of 'Kathy.' By taking on             such a name which, being long, is male, she would be able to become             a female-male or a night-knight.

In one, Don Quixote rejoices in a desire         "restored," through complete "neediness" and "desparation," which is equated         with "the desperation of a baby who must suck [her mother's] nipple" (Acker,         192). In another, a "female pirate" travels over "crumbling European waters"         in a new "mo[u]rning," "totally strong in [her] helplessness," listening         to the "violent sex between sun and water" (Acker, 200).</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Works Cited</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Acker, Kathy. <i>Don         Quixote</i>.
