The goal of the research         is to participate in the on-going international debate on the twentieth         century canon<i> </i>and on modernism by focussing on the complexity of         the years under scrutiny and by re-reading the multifaceted relationships         between art, life and history.<i> </i>This project proceeds from an assumption         we share with the Russian semiotician Ju. M. Lotman, namely, that the         past never ends&#150;once and for all&#150;but, rather, it always creates         new values. Our<i> </i>intention is to contribute to the reconstruction         of the multiple directions that were open in actual history but have been         abandoned, and to bring them once again to the attention of the present.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Research focuses         on a<i> </i>number<i> </i>of women who have, through their different initiatives:         a) proposed, built, asserted an autonomous female subjectivity; b) stated         different and radical redefinitions of masculine and feminine sexualities,         of the social roles of men and women and of changes in sex relationships         as a starting point for a new history and a new culture; c) assisted and         supported the emergence of an (interethnic) international and supranational         culture.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;These women<i>         </i>shall be considered not<i> </i>as pawns to be added to the checkerboard         of modernism, or as isolated literary or cultural personalities whose         exceptionality we want to consecrate; they will rather be studied<i> </i>in         their qualities as founders of magazines and journals, creators of salons         or theater groups, or as social and political activists. From this perspective,         they will be considered as links connecting and promoting a vast array         of human, political, cultural and literary relations. Their high intellectual         activity, moreover, will be constantly related to the mass sociopolitical         movements that characterized the period going from the last decade of         the nineteenth century to the second World War: suffragism and pacifism,         communism and anarchism, trade unionism and political reformism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Within the overall         scope of the general project, the sub-group of the University of Macerata,         where I teach, is concentrating<i> </i>on the London scene and specifically         on four women belonging all to the same generation, three of them English,         and one American: Dora Marsden (1882-1960), Harriet Shaw Weaver (1876-1961),<i>         </i>Bryher (Anne Winifred Ellerman, 1894-1983 and H.

The three journals taken into consideration are: <i>The Freewoman</i>/<i>The         New Freewoman</i>/<i>The Egoist</i>, <i>Close-up</i> and <i>Life and Letters         Today </i>for the years 1935-39; they cover a time span running from the         beginning of the century to World War II, thus living through the transitional         interwar phase.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">II. <i>The Freewoman</i>/<i>The         New Freewoman</i>/<i>The Egoist </i>(1911-1919)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The<i> </i>study         of <i>The Freewoman/The Egoist</i> (1911-1919), as well as that of its         founder Dora Marsden and of Harriet Shaw Weaver, who financed the journal         and directed the Egoist Press, intends to bring to the fore the mutual         dynamic relationship between suffragist activism and the ethical and aesthetic<i>         </i>thought based on individualism and emancipation taking shape within         the section of British feminism which will eventually become the nurturing         ground of the modernist avant-garde (H.D., T.S.

Tucker were, among others, contributors to the         journal).<i> </i>At the same time, the personalities and key issues of         the cultural debate promoted by both the journal and the publishing house&#150;from         women's suffrage to the problems connected with female identity, sexuality         and social changes&#150; are being closely scrutinized. Contributors and         subscribers from both sides of the Atlantic were involved in such a debate,         as indeed, both in London and in the United States "Discussion Clubs"         were activated. We are also giving great attention to the interaction         between feminism and economic thought, taking into consideration also         the very concrete problems connected with the material survival of the         journal itself (financial support, loans, investments, etc.).</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The<i> </i>story         of <i>The Freewoman/The Egoist </i>can be briefly told by simply studying         the variations in its title and editorship.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. The first<i> </i>number         of <i>The Freewoman</i>, <i>A Weekly Feminist Review</i>, a magazine edited         by Dora Marsden &amp; Mary Gawthorpe, appears on 23 Nov.1911. It will         carry this title until April 1912. In March of the same year Mary Gawthorpe         resigns from the joint editorship for political reasons.<i> </i>In the         first editorial, "The Bondwomen," Marsden illustrates both the scope and         the aims of the magazine by rhetorically and negatively defining "the         Freewoman" in antithesis with the "bondwoman." The antonyms "bond" and         "free" are the polarized extremes of the opposition between static and         dynamic, past-present and future, interior and exterior, material and         spiritual-intellectual, independent<i> </i>and dependent. The opposition         also brings to the fore Marsden's vision of things:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Bondwomen are         the women who are not separate spiritual entities&#150;who are not individuals.         They are complements merely.<i> </i>By habit of thought, by form of activity,         each of them rounds off the personality of some other individual, rather         than create or cultivate her own.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Freedom is in         the individual soul, and that no other force can either give it or take         it away: (...) only Freewomen can be free, or lead the way to freedom.         They will learn that their freedom will consist in appraising their own         worth, in setting up their own standards and living up to them, and putting         behind them their role of complacent self-sacrifice. For none can judge         of another soul's value. The individual has to record its<i> </i>own."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The &quot;Notes&quot;         which follow the editorial point out the importance of the magazine as         an instrument that the feminist movement gives itself as a tool for reflexive         thought:<i> </i>"For the first time, feminists themselves make the attempt         to reflect the feminist movement in the mirror of thought."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In the intention         of its founder, the magazine's distinctive contribution to the movement         lies in the fact that while other magazines and journals stress the importance         of "acquiring things," <i>The Freewoman</i> is interested in what women         can become:<i> </i>"Our interest is in the Freewoman herself, her psychology,         philosophy, morality and achievements, and only in a secondary degree         with her politics and economics."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Among the regular         contributors to the magazine are: Theresa Billington-Greig, founder of         the Women's Freedom League; Ada Neild Chew, radical suffragist; H.G.

The implications following upon this suggested         false identity are so clearly indicated in a letter addressed to us by         a group of contributors, to whose generous support the paper has owed         much from its start, that we may allow it to state this aspect of the         case, and in publishing the letter we take the opportunity of acknowledging         the courtesy of its authors.

The emphasis laid on women and their         ways and works was, as pointed out in the early days of the first <i>Freewoman</i>,         more in the nature of retort than of argument. 'Feminism&#146; was the         natural replay<i> </i>of 'Hominism&#146; and the intent of both these         was more to tighten the strings of the controversy than to reveal anything         vital in the mind of the controversialists. What women could, should,         might, would do if they were allowed was to retort to those who said that         such things they could, should, might, would not do and therefore should         not be allowed. The feminist argument was an overture many times repeated         to a composition voicing the great works of women. The controversialists         are now tired, and the spectators can reasonably expect to have something         of the main composition. What women&#150;awakened, emancipated, roused,         and what-not&#150;what they can do, it is open for them to do; and judgment         as unbiased as ever it is likely to be, is ready to abide by the evidence         of their works' quality.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The time has         arrived when mentally-honest women feel that they have no use for the         springing-board of large promises of powers redeemable in a distant future.         Just as they feel they can be as 'free' now, as they have the power to         be, they know that their works can give evidence now of whatever quality         they are capable of giving to them. To attempt to be freer than their         own power warrants means that curious thing&#150;protected freedom and         their ability, allowed credit because it is women is a 'protected' ability.         'Freedom' and 'ability' recognised by permission, are privileges which         they find can serve no useful purpose."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;c) "Egoism"</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The moment when         we propose attaching to ourselves a new label seems the right one to answer         an objection raised by a contributor, Mr. Benj. R. Tucker, in the present         issue, against a former statement that we 'stand for nothing.' <i>The         Egoist</i> (we suppose he will say) at least will stand for egoism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The irony of         'standing' for a thing lies in the fact that the first return the thing         stood for makes is to bring its advocates kneeling before it. A man will         lie down prone before the thing he 'stands for' and serve it, and the         one assertion of egoism is, to our minds, that a man shall make it his         concern with things to force them to minister to him. Standing for anything         whatsoever means setting that thing on a pedestal, demanding that all         around it shall pay it tribute. 'Let Justice be, though the heavens fall';         if for Justice we read, all or any of the things which have been 'stood         for' in human history &#150;and their number is legion&#150;we assemble         the hosts of tyrants to which men have presented their souls to be scourged         since the world began. From among these tyrants there is nothing to choose.         They apply the scourge with equal zest. Liberty is as tender as Moloch,         Justice is as white-handed as them all. The egoist stands for nothing:         his affair is to see to it that he shall not be compelled to kneel; and         provided that he remains standing, all that he need of those things, before         which men have bowed down because they first consented to 'stand for'         them, shall be his for the getting. Mr. Tucker rakes up our past propositions         against us: it is a kindly service as it enables us to train them a little         clearer. 'We stand for the empowering of individuals' we have said. Our         usual modesty, we fear! We hope that we may empower individuals: we think         we shall. We know we do empower ourselves, our contributors, and those         who find<i> </i>pleasure in reading us: three admirable achievements of         which the most admirable is the first. But ourselves apart, we do not         'stand for' the empowerment of any...</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Primarily the         paper is...written to please ourselves. If, while making things clear         to ourselves, we make difficulties for our readers, we have done nothing         alien to that which we set out to do."</font></p>      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back       to top)</font></a></font>       <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><img src="../../pictures/camboni.jpg" width="145" height="155" align="left" alt="Marina Camboni">BIO</b>:         Marina Camboni is Professor of American Literature at the University of         Macerata (Italy) and has published a number of studies on contemporary         American women poets as well as a translation of H.D.'s <i>Trilogy</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to Alerts)</font></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Palatino"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="index.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">go         to this issue's table of contents</font></a> </font></font></p>      <hr>      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="153" height="1" valign="top"><img width="152" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="10" height="1" valign="top"><img width="10" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="73" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="73" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="23" height="1" valign="top"><img width="23" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
