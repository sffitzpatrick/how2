Growing up working class taught me how to survive.         Growing up working class is part of my very breathing. How are "poetries         of identity" created? How are they made normative?

While it is now possible         to identify a trajectory of experimental women's writing, to inhabit a         vocabulary of gender and sexuality, references to class often remain just         that: mere codes. Several problematic issues arise both in the writing         of, and writing about, what we might call "working class poetry."</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">First, the drive         to create "poetries of identity" (a phrase I've been using for some time)         tends to solidify normalizing tendencies in terms of form, style, and         content, i.e. does a poem have to be narrative, "I"-based and "about"         work in order to be considered "working class"? Furthermore, drawing a         straight line between one's identity and one's poetics is problematic         at best and confuses the biographical information about the poet with         poetic works that genuinely seek to explore, unseat, complicate subjectivity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The obvious point         to be made is that identities are infinitely mediated and complex; coming         from a particular class, race, gender is not&#8211;and should not be&#8211;the map         through which one can trace a trajectory toward a particular type of poetic         expression. That said, I still consider Lorine Niedecker (along with being         a great Modernist, experimental, American, woman writer) to be a great         working class writer. It is part of providing myself with a history.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Dear Hilda, Dear         Wallace, Dear Michael, Dear Frederick </i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Dear Marianne,         Dear ball and stick, Dear K, Dear K, Dear K, Dear K</i></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A language of         provisional objects</font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A language of         hunger</font></i></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The head of the         hammer</font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">flying off and         cracking</font></i></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Or a spade unable         to overturn </font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">the solid earth</font></i></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Does the word         "proletarian" refer?</font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">See now, a figure         described as my grandmother crossing a room</font></i></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Replace "I" with         "salt in a bag" </font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the face of         my parents' illiteracy</font></i></p>      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">all the ravages         </font></i></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My anxieties race         through me at a difference pace, clutching at my lungs, my throat, making         it difficult to swallow or breathe. My childhood anxiety wasn't made up         of monsters in the closet, or fear of the dark. My anxiety was tied to         something which my parents could only haltingly save me from, something         which they toiled vigorously to save the entire family from: poverty.         The threat of falling into poverty, losing one's health, losing a job,         that looms over the working class creates particular anxieties, mental         health issues, and survival strategies. I learned to take care of myself         early because it was required. During much of my childhood, my parents         each worked two jobs, and I was often alone. Now in her fifties, my mother         faces health problems which I can only attribute to years of overwork.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I took care of myself.         I struggled. I got angry. Though the idea that I would go to college was         with me from a young age, there was no such thing as a "college fund"         to pay for it; my parents had no money to sent me to college. If I were         to go, I had to figure out the way myself. And I did. I became an incredible         over-achiever. I racked up academic awards, anxiety, and rage. I knew         I must always do more, be better, to prove myself worthy. I took nothing         for granted.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Education is like         a religion for the working class. It's the "way out." Of course, at the         present moment, that both is and isn't true. This news has reached even         popular journals, such as <i>Spin</i>, which reports in its October 1997         article on "Sucker Ph.D.'s": </font></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">More than one             third of all new history Ph.D.s will never find full-time teaching             work, according to the American Historical Associations' own newsletter,             paltry numbers given the mammoth amount of time you have to invest             to discover your fate. Across all fields, 40,000-plus students will             receive their doctorates this year. Few have illusions about what             awaits them: a handful of good jobs, each sought by hundreds of applicants;             university presses less and less willing to publish the academic books             needed to gain tenure; protracted separations from loved ones. Grad             school, an option nearly every halfway idealistic college student             contemplates, has become an invitation to purgatory. </font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This brings me to         the inevitable discussion of MFA programs. Camille Roy, in a recent discussion         on the SUNY Buffalo Poetics ListServ interestingly points out that when         she first came to the Bay Area, there were resources available in the         community for writers to learn more about their craft, such as the free         workshops offered by Bob Gluck through Small Press Traffic. Roy attributes         the current institutionalization of such resources into university MFA         programs, where people must pay for access, to dwindling funding for the         arts. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is a very difficult         situation, and while it is true that few poor and working class people         will apply themselves to a graduate program, such as an MFA, which virtually         guarantees that they will not find a job, some institutions such as San         Francisco State University are historically very working class. Like other         working class folks, I worked full-time while completing my MFA in poetry         at State. It took me five years to complete the three-year program, and         during that time I endured a level of exhaustion and stress which had         adverse effects on my health. (I was almost hospitalized in the middle         of it in 1993.) </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition, it must         be pointed out that not everyone enters such a program with equal amounts         of privilege, and completing a degree, while providing for the acquisition         of particular cultural capital, is not a great leveler. Working class         people are often worse off when graduating because of the massive student         loan debts they carry with them. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So why did I do it?         Because my working class heritage has imbued me with a stubbornness which         allows one small part of myself to refuse to accept that I am not allowed         to have what other people have just because they come from wealthy families         and I don't. I wanted to learn. I wanted an intellectual community. I         wanted a writing community. Are MFA programs the best answer to all of         that? Certainly not, but I did gain some of what I wanted in all three         of those areas. And I existed at State, much more than I did as an undergraduate         at Columbia University and Oberlin College, because I could look around         and see my experience reflected, and not feel so much the horrible grating         of isolation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the passage of         place<br>        </i></font><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">in desire<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">a geometric         development<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">heretofore         opposed to wake<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">pronouncements         and sedentary acts<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">the         startling possibility of collectivity<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">when         money has everything and nothing to do with it<br>        </font></i><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I'm         just trying to get us both on the same page"</font></i></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">People assume they         know who I am because I am white, because I am "educated," because I am         reasonably articulate. But my efforts to be "good enough" have been too         successful: they have helped to erase who I am. I pass so well, but you         look through me, and what you do not see says so much.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">My own writing comes         out of those points of pressure and contradiction. The education which         introduced me to Anne-Marie Albiach, Gertrude Stein, Maurice Blanchot,         post-structuralism, and experimental narrative, also ensures that I am         a stranger to my own family. I now speak at least two languages. I cannot         forget, or erase, one in favor of the other in the difficult act of writing.         <i>Amphibious, we live in both worlds, but belong to neither.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Writing which brings         to bear the full force of one's psychic, material (body and word) power         is not sweet or delicate. It is not "safe." To fully inhabit the world         of working class subjectivity in a poem requires that I withstand an incredible         emotional pressure. I scratch away at the codes or placeholders which         seem to want to denote class, and try to find what lies underneath. <i>In         the face of silence, only my stutter.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While literacy is         certainly an issue when discussing the "accessibility" of innovative works,         I have sat with readers with high school educations and Ph.D.'s alike         while they encountered similar challenges and delights in unlayering a         poem. I refuse to assume or presume my audience&#150;any audience&#150;during         my writing process. To assume that the "true" working class poem is only         a narrative exposition of working class "experience," is to buy into normative         reading patterns established by post-WWII academic poetries in the U.S.         This assumption precludes the full possibilities of language, isolating         working class poets to a particular kind of expressionism. It would be         difficult to find a parallel prescription placed on the depiction of class         in other art forms.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The difficulty in         discussing class and poetics reflects the larger obfuscation of class         within American culture. While Labor is becoming more visible as we near         the end of the 20th century, and the intelligentsia faces a job market         of dwindling opportunity and wealth is concentrated in the hands of an         increasing few, the myth of a "classless" society persists. (Have you         pulled yourself up by your own bootstraps lately?)</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Too often, class         is conflated with race in a fuzzy-headed analysis that fails to account         for the conflicting privileges/oppressions of race and class. I continue         to believe that it is extremely valuable for white working class people         to speak out about their experiences and interrogate what it means to         live simultaneously not only with racial privilege, but also under economic         oppression. Exploring these kinds of contradictions is the only way that         theory will catch up with praxis.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As someone both white         and working class, I have often been painfully invisible, particularly         in academic environments where it was much more comfortable for white         academics to assume that I was "like them" despite evidence to the contrary.         One woman at Oberlin repeatedly insisted to my face, "You're like me?         your parents have money." The fact that I was not supported financially         by my parents was a foreign concept to her, and far too many others. I         had to insist on my own existence, insist on the right to my own experience,         and avoid being put in the position of taking care of their feelings of         guilt.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Writing is thievery,         as in stealing time. </i>I will forever be envious of those who are afforded         the material conditions and privilege in which to write. Those whose parents         paid for them to go to college. Those who grew up blissfully unaware of         financial struggle. Those whose families are able to provide them with         a crucial safety net in times of crisis. These people have the things         that I always wanted, but will never have. I can't go back and change         that. I can only fight to harness my fear and rage in a way which returns         me to the page in a productive way as a poet who believes that issues         of power and privilege are of vital importance.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This essay first         appeared in <i>tripwire: a journal of poetics</i>, no. 1, Spring, 1998.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><a href="#top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(back         to top)</font></a></font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Palatino"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BIO</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">:         </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kathy Lou Schultz         was born in Burke, South Dakota and grew up in central Nebraska.
