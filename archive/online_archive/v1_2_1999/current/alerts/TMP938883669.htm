      Ezra Pound H.D. and &quot;The Art of the Future&quot;</i>: A report on the 
      new collaborative research project being pursued in five Italian universities</font> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The Art of the 
        Future" is the title Dora Marsden gave to the editorial of the November 
        1st , 1913 issue of <i>The New Freewoman</i>, where the second part of 
        Pound's<i> </i>"The Serious Artist" was also published.<i> </i>A couple 
        of issues later the journal published a letter&#150;signed, among others, 
        by Pound himself&#150;where it was asked that the name<i> </i>Freewoman 
        be discarded from the title and, with it, all connection with feminism 
        and related subject matters.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;I would like 
        to share with the readers of HOW2 some of the findings &#150;and a few 
        considerations&#150;coming out of my work on the journal founded in 1911 
        by Dora Marsden, a suffragist and former member of the WSPU, and first<i> 
        </i>entitled <i>The Freewoman</i>, then<i> The New Freewoman</i>, finally 
        <i>The Egoist</i>. My plan is to first introduce the work I am doing and 
        its aims, and then focus on a few key<i> </i>points in the relation between 
        feminism and modernism. For this reason I shall divide my contribution 
        into three sections, the first devoted to the larger research project 
        which I direct and of which this study is also part. This section I shall 
        conclude with an extensive quotation from the article Dora Marsden published 
        in the last issue of <i>The New Freewoman</i> to explain why, with the 
        January 1st 1914 issue, the title of the journal would<i> </i>become <i>The 
        Egoist</i>.<i> </i>The second section will be devoted to an analysis<i> 
        </i>and interpretation of the piece. The third, and final, will be devoted 
        to the article Dora Marsden entitled "The art of the future,"<i> </i>its 
        relation to H.D.'s <i>Notes on Thought and Vision</i> and the mind/body 
        (female) connection in<i> </i>modernist art.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Looking at modernist 
        poetics from the perspective of these two women, I shall on the one hand 
        trace the feminist&#150;i.e. political<i> </i>and radical&#150;roots of<i> 
        </i>modernist art; on the other, I shall point out what direction that 
        art might have taken had not the Pound/Eliot's version of modernist poetry 
        and poetics been hegemonic.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The study of 
        the relationship between modernism and feminism<i> </i>is at the center 
        of the<i> </i>research project: &quot;Networking Women: Subjects, Places, 
        Links: Europe-America, 1890-1939.&quot;<i> </i>It aims towards a rewriting 
        of cultural history, involving<i> </i>five groups of women from different 
        Italian universities, each with its own sub-project. The goal of the research 
        is to participate in the on-going international debate on the twentieth 
        century canon<i> </i>and on modernism by focussing on the complexity of 
        the years under scrutiny and by re-reading the multifaceted relationships 
        between art, life and history.<i> </i>This project proceeds from an assumption 
        we share with the Russian semiotician Ju. M. Lotman, namely, that the 
        past never ends&#150;once and for all&#150;but, rather, it always creates 
        new values. Our<i> </i>intention is to contribute to the reconstruction 
        of the multiple directions that were open in actual history but have been 
        abandoned, and to bring them once again to the attention of the present.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Research focuses 
        on a<i> </i>number<i> </i>of women who have, through their different initiatives: 
        a) proposed, built, asserted an autonomous female subjectivity; b) stated 
        different and radical redefinitions of masculine and feminine sexualities, 
        of the social roles of men and women and of changes in sex relationships 
        as a starting point for a new history and a new culture; c) assisted and 
        supported the emergence of an (interethnic) international and supranational 
        culture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;These women<i> 
        </i>shall be considered not<i> </i>as pawns to be added to the checkerboard 
        of modernism, or as isolated literary or cultural personalities whose 
        exceptionality we want to consecrate; they will rather be studied<i> </i>in 
        their qualities as founders of magazines and journals, creators of salons 
        or theater groups, or as social and political activists. From this perspective, 
        they will be considered as links connecting and promoting a vast array 
        of human, political, cultural and literary relations. Their high intellectual 
        activity, moreover, will be constantly related to the mass sociopolitical 
        movements that characterized the period going from the last decade of 
        the nineteenth century to the second World War: suffragism and pacifism, 
        communism and anarchism, trade unionism and political reformism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Within the overall 
        scope of the general project, the sub-group of the University of Macerata, 
        where I teach, is concentrating<i> </i>on the London scene and specifically 
        on four women belonging all to the same generation, three of them English, 
        and one American: Dora Marsden (1882-1960), Harriet Shaw Weaver (1876-1961),<i> 
        </i>Bryher (Anne Winifred Ellerman, 1894-1983 and H. D. ( Hilda Doolittle, 
        1886-1961).<i> </i>We intend to investigate the network of personal, political 
        and cultural relations these four women<i> </i>established through the 
        journals they directed, financed and/or contributed to, in order to map 
        the connections between art and life, politics and economy, gender and 
        power. The three journals taken into consideration are: <i>The Freewoman</i>/<i>The 
        New Freewoman</i>/<i>The Egoist</i>, <i>Close-up</i> and <i>Life and Letters 
        Today </i>for the years 1935-39; they cover a time span running from the 
        beginning of the century to World War II, thus living through the transitional 
        interwar phase.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">II. <i>The Freewoman</i>/<i>The 
        New Freewoman</i>/<i>The Egoist </i>(1911-1919)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The<i> </i>study 
        of <i>The Freewoman/The Egoist</i> (1911-1919), as well as that of its 
        founder Dora Marsden and of Harriet Shaw Weaver, who financed the journal 
        and directed the Egoist Press, intends to bring to the fore the mutual 
        dynamic relationship between suffragist activism and the ethical and aesthetic<i> 
        </i>thought based on individualism and emancipation taking shape within 
        the section of British feminism which will eventually become the nurturing 
        ground of the modernist avant-garde (H.D., T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Rebecca 
        West, H.G. Wells, Upton Sinclair, Richard Aldington, Havelock Ellis, Edward 
        Carpenter, Benjamin R. Tucker were, among others, contributors to the 
        journal).<i> </i>At the same time, the personalities and key issues of 
        the cultural debate promoted by both the journal and the publishing house&#150;from 
        women's suffrage to the problems connected with female identity, sexuality 
        and social changes&#150; are being closely scrutinized. Contributors and 
        subscribers from both sides of the Atlantic were involved in such a debate, 
        as indeed, both in London and in the United States "Discussion Clubs" 
        were activated. We are also giving great attention to the interaction 
        between feminism and economic thought, taking into consideration also 
        the very concrete problems connected with the material survival of the 
        journal itself (financial support, loans, investments, etc.).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The<i> </i>story 
        of <i>The Freewoman/The Egoist </i>can be briefly told by simply studying 
        the variations in its title and editorship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. The first<i> </i>number 
        of <i>The Freewoman</i>, <i>A Weekly Feminist Review</i>, a magazine edited 
        by Dora Marsden &amp; Mary Gawthorpe, appears on 23 Nov.1911. It will 
        carry this title until April 1912. In March of the same year Mary Gawthorpe 
        resigns from the joint editorship for political reasons.<i> </i>In the 
        first editorial, "The Bondwomen," Marsden illustrates both the scope and 
        the aims of the magazine by rhetorically and negatively defining "the 
        Freewoman" in antithesis with the "bondwoman." The antonyms "bond" and 
        "free" are the polarized extremes of the opposition between static and 
        dynamic, past-present and future, interior and exterior, material and 
        spiritual-intellectual, independent<i> </i>and dependent. The opposition 
        also brings to the fore Marsden's vision of things:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Bondwomen are 
        the women who are not separate spiritual entities&#150;who are not individuals. 
        They are complements merely.<i> </i>By habit of thought, by form of activity, 
        each of them rounds off the personality of some other individual, rather 
        than create or cultivate her own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Freedom is in 
        the individual soul, and that no other force can either give it or take 
        it away: (...) only Freewomen can be free, or lead the way to freedom. 
        They will learn that their freedom will consist in appraising their own 
        worth, in setting up their own standards and living up to them, and putting 
        behind them their role of complacent self-sacrifice. For none can judge 
        of another soul's value. The individual has to record its<i> </i>own."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The &quot;Notes&quot; 
        which follow the editorial point out the importance of the magazine as 
        an instrument that the feminist movement gives itself as a tool for reflexive 
        thought:<i> </i>"For the first time, feminists themselves make the attempt 
        to reflect the feminist movement in the mirror of thought."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In the intention 
        of its founder, the magazine's distinctive contribution to the movement 
        lies in the fact that while other magazines and journals stress the importance 
        of "acquiring things," <i>The Freewoman</i> is interested in what women 
        can become:<i> </i>"Our interest is in the Freewoman herself, her psychology, 
        philosophy, morality and achievements, and only in a secondary degree 
        with her politics and economics."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Among the regular 
        contributors to the magazine are: Theresa Billington-Greig, founder of 
        the Women's Freedom League; Ada Neild Chew, radical suffragist; H.G. Wells 
        and Rebecca West. Supporters and contributors are also socialist Edward 
        Carpenter, psychologist Havelock Ellis,<i> </i>anarchists<i> </i>Guy Aldred 
        and<i> </i>Rose Witcup. Stella Browne, founder of the Abortion Law Reform 
        Association, contributes under the pseudonym "A New Subscriber."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;The debate centers 
        on the relationship between individual life, sexuality and social change:<i> 
        </i>there are articles devoted to marriage and free sex, birth-control 
        and homosexuality.<i> </i>Many radical feminists and a number of men consider 
        the magazine, in the words of writer<i> </i>R.W. Kaufman, "a torch in 
        the night."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Benjamin R. Tucker, 
        an American anarchist, maintains that <i>The Freewoman</i> is the most 
        important publication of the time.<i> </i>During the first year of publication, 
        D. Marsden's interests veer towards esotericism,<i> </i>Max Stirner&#146;s 
        philosophy (<i>The Ego and His Own</i>), religion and<i> </i>anarchism. 
        Dora starts to plead for the liberation not only of all women but of all 
        individuals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. With the issue 
        of May 23, 1912 the magazine changes its sub-title. It becomes <i>The 
        Freewoman</i>&#150;<i>A Weekly Humanist Review</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Dora Marsden's 
        virulent attacks on the Pankhursts and the politics of the WSPU and her 
        closeness to anarchist positions&#150;the radical themes the magazine 
        deals with&#150;create a general outcry against it. The distributor W.H. 
        Smith refuses to distribute it.<i> </i>In October, 1912 the magazine closes.<i> 
        </i>The publisher refuses to pay and the last issue is published with<i> 
        </i>G.C. Beresford's contribution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In the meanwhile, 
        the success of the magazine has been such that Freewoman Discussion Groups 
        have been created in Great Britain and in the United States. These groups 
        continue to support the magazine. In America subscribers start a new politics 
        of support. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Thanks tho the 
        creation of a society of stockholders and the fundamental contribution 
        of Harriet Shaw Weaver, the magazine resumes publication as a fortnightly 
        with the title: <i>The New Freewoman</i>&#150;<i>An Individualist Review</i>, 
        edited by Dora Marsden. The first issue appears on June 15 , 1913. It 
        costs 6&#163;.<i> </i>Regular contributors are Rebecca West<i> </i>and Benjamin 
        R. Tucker, Barbara Low, Edward Carpenter. With n.5 (August 15), E. Pound, 
        introduced by Rebecca West,<i> </i>starts his collaboration.<i> </i>He 
        will be in charge of the literary part of the magazine which subsequently 
        will have more and more space.<i> </i>R. Aldington, J. Cournos, D.Richardson 
        and H.D. start to contribute.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. <i>The Egoist</i>&#150;<i>An 
        Individualist Review</i> appears on January 1, 1914, once more edited 
        by Dora Marsden, with R. Aldington and L.A. Compton-Rickett as assistant 
        editors.<i> </i>With the new name, the literary part will be hegemonic.<i> 
        </i>D. Marsden contributes less and less till she leaves the direction 
        and becomes "contributing editor" with issue 13 (July 1914). Harriet Shaw 
        Weaver takes over as director, Aldington is confirmed as editorial assistant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;In June, 1916 
        H.D. substitutes<i> </i>for Aldington&#150;who leaves for the front. In 
        June, 1917 T.S. Eliot<i> </i>becomes literary editor but as a matter of 
        fact he takes full charge of the magazine. The last issue is published 
        December,1919.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">III.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;What<i> </i>I 
        would like to focus on now is the point of fracture beteween modernism 
        and feminism as it is represented in the last issue of <i>The New Freewoman</i>. 
        For this reason I shall quote extensively from the long piece Dora Marsden 
        wrote for the<i> </i>"Views and Comments" section to explain the change 
        of names of the magazine. Within the article itself, the letter Ezra Pound 
        and other contributors wrote to the editor is reproduced. This time I 
        shall not comment on the issues arising in the piece, but in the next 
        issue of HOW2 I shall<i> </i>provide a short analysis and expand on the 
        relation between Marsden, Pound and H.D.&#150;respectively editor of and 
        contributors to <i>The New Freewoman</i>&#150;on their divergent aesthetic 
        projects<i> </i>and directions the debate over "the new in art" could 
        have taken if Pound had not dominated the scene.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The New Frewoman</i> 
        and <i>The Egoist</i></font></p>

        title.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"It is proposed 
        that with our issue of January 1st, 1914, the title of <i>The New Freewoman</i> 
        be changed to <i>The Egoist</i>."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Although <i>The 
        New Freewoman</i> has been in existence only six months, it has become 
        clear that its present title can be regarded only as a serious handicap. 
        It contrives to suggest what the paper is not, and fails to give any indication 
        whatsoever as to what it is. The implications following upon this suggested 
        false identity are so clearly indicated in a letter addressed to us by 
        a group of contributors, to whose generous support the paper has owed 
        much from its start, that we may allow it to state this aspect of the 
        case, and in publishing the letter we take the opportunity of acknowledging 
        the courtesy of its authors. It runs:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"We offer a commodity 
        for sale under a description which is not only calculated to attract a 
        section of the public for which in itself can have no attraction but which 
        would be an active deterrent to those who should compose its natural audience. 
        At the time the title was assumed there existed considerations strong 
        enough to lead us to its adoption; these now no longer exist and we therefore 
        propose that the change be made.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"In adopting 
        the neutral title <i>The Egoist</i> and thereby obliterating the "woman" 
        character from the journal, we do not feel that we are abandoning anything 
        there would be wisdom in retaining. The emphasis laid on women and their 
        ways and works was, as pointed out in the early days of the first <i>Freewoman</i>, 
        more in the nature of retort than of argument. 'Feminism&#146; was the 
        natural replay<i> </i>of 'Hominism&#146; and the intent of both these 
        was more to tighten the strings of the controversy than to reveal anything 
        vital in the mind of the controversialists. What women could, should, 
        might, would do if they were allowed was to retort to those who said that 
        such things they could, should, might, would not do and therefore should 
        not be allowed. The feminist argument was an overture many times repeated 
        to a composition voicing the great works of women. The controversialists 
        are now tired, and the spectators can reasonably expect to have something 
        of the main composition. What women&#150;awakened, emancipated, roused, 
        and what-not&#150;what they can do, it is open for them to do; and judgment 
        as unbiased as ever it is likely to be, is ready to abide by the evidence 
        of their works' quality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The time has 
        arrived when mentally-honest women feel that they have no use for the 
        springing-board of large promises of powers redeemable in a distant future. 
        Just as they feel they can be as 'free' now, as they have the power to 
        be, they know that their works can give evidence now of whatever quality 
        they are capable of giving to them. To attempt to be freer than their 
        own power warrants means that curious thing&#150;protected freedom and 
        their ability, allowed credit because it is women is a 'protected' ability. 
        'Freedom' and 'ability' recognised by permission, are privileges which 
        they find can serve no useful purpose."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;c) "Egoism"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The moment when 
        we propose attaching to ourselves a new label seems the right one to answer 
        an objection raised by a contributor, Mr. Benj. R. Tucker, in the present 
        issue, against a former statement that we 'stand for nothing.' <i>The 
        Egoist</i> (we suppose he will say) at least will stand for egoism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"The irony of 
        'standing' for a thing lies in the fact that the first return the thing 
        stood for makes is to bring its advocates kneeling before it. A man will 
        lie down prone before the thing he 'stands for' and serve it, and the 
        one assertion of egoism is, to our minds, that a man shall make it his 
        concern with things to force them to minister to him. Standing for anything 
        whatsoever means setting that thing on a pedestal, demanding that all 
        around it shall pay it tribute. 'Let Justice be, though the heavens fall'; 
        if for Justice we read, all or any of the things which have been 'stood 
        for' in human history &#150;and their number is legion&#150;we assemble 
        the hosts of tyrants to which men have presented their souls to be scourged 
        since the world began. From among these tyrants there is nothing to choose. 
        They apply the scourge with equal zest. Liberty is as tender as Moloch, 
        Justice is as white-handed as them all. The egoist stands for nothing: 
        his affair is to see to it that he shall not be compelled to kneel; and 
        provided that he remains standing, all that he need of those things, before 
        which men have bowed down because they first consented to 'stand for' 
        them, shall be his for the getting. Mr. Tucker rakes up our past propositions 
        against us: it is a kindly service as it enables us to train them a little 
        clearer. 'We stand for the empowering of individuals' we have said. Our 
        usual modesty, we fear! We hope that we may empower individuals: we think 
        we shall. We know we do empower ourselves, our contributors, and those 
        who find<i> </i>pleasure in reading us: three admirable achievements of 
        which the most admirable is the first. But ourselves apart, we do not 
        'stand for' the empowerment of any...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;"Primarily the 
        paper is...written to please ourselves. If, while making things clear 
        to ourselves, we make difficulties for our readers, we have done nothing 
        alien to that which we set out to do."</font></p>
