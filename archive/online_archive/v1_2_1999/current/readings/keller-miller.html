This phenomenon was widely remarked at the time in England and         the U.S. and has been much studied recently. In 1925, a fellow editor,         Alfred Kreymborg, speculates about when precisely &quot;what is popularly         called the renaissance of American poetry&quot; began. Initially, he proposes         1912, &quot;when <i>The Poetry Magazine</i> first appeared in Chicago.&quot;         Referring later to <i>Poetry</i> and <i>The Little Review</i>, he asks:         &quot;Were women to play the role of pioneers formerly usurped by men?&quot;<a href="#1">[1]</a>         Other commentary was more acerbic. For example, Ezra Pound refers to Harriet         Monroe in his letters as a &quot;bloody fool&quot; in need of his guidance.         &quot;H. Monroe,&quot; he writes, &quot;seems to think that if her Chicago         widows and spinsters will only shell out she can turn her gang of free-versers         into geniuses all of a onceness.&quot; <a href="#2">[2]</a> Similarly,         Pound comments that Jane Heap and Margaret Anderson, in printing part         of <i>Ulysses</i> in <i>The Little Review</i>, are &quot;editrices&quot;         who &quot;have merely messed and muddled.&quot; Even Marianne Moore who         is otherwise praised in his correspondence, &quot;has the brains to edit&quot;         but &quot;all sewed up in a bag&quot;&#150;a remark Pound does not explain.<a href="#3">[3]</a>         This letter was written in 1931 to Harriet Monroe on the subject of who         should take over editing <i>Poetry Magazine</i> after her retirement.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#9;Here are the         basic facts outlining the broadest perimeters of this phenomenon. In 1911,         Harriet Monroe founded <i>Poetry</i>, which she edited from that time         until her death in 1936. <i>Poetry</i> was co-edited for three and a half         years by Alice Corbin Henderson, although out of gratitude Monroe kept         Henderson on the masthead for seven years after tuberculosis prevented         her from further work for the journal. In 1914, Margaret Anderson founded         <i>The Little Review</i> in Chicago, but soon moved the journal to New         York where she co-edited it with Jane Heap. Also in New York, Lola Ridge         was the American editor of <i>Broom</i> from 1922-1923, and Marianne Moore         edited <i>The Dial</i> from 1925 to 1929, beginning extensive editorial         assistance, when Alyse Gregory was managing editor. In England, Dora Marsden         founded and edited <i>The New Freewoman</i> in 1911, which was renamed         <i>The Egoist</i> in 1913, when Harriet Shaw Weaver took over the editing         and Ezra Pound assumed direction of literary editing for the journal.         During this time, H.D. served as literary editor for a year. African American         women poets also held positions of importance in literary journals: Jesse         Fausset was literary editor of <i>The Crisis</i> from 1919 to 1926 and         Gwendolyn Bennett was assistant editor of <i>Opportunity</i> from the         mid-twenties until 1931.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women founded and         ran presses and bookstores as well as journals, although for financial&#150;and         perhaps other&#150;reasons, many did so abroad rather than at home. For         example, Harriet Weaver founded the Egoist Press; Virginia Woolf (with         her husband) the Hogarth Press; Bryher, the heiress of one of England&#146;s         largest fortunes, helped fund several avant-garde presses and publications,         including the Contact Press which published Moore&#146;s first collection         of poems. In Paris, Caresse and Harry Crosby founded and ran the Black         Sun Press and Nancy Cunard the Hours Press; Sylvia Beach founded and ran         the influential bookstore &quot;Shakespeare &amp; Co.&quot; (1914-1941),         which also engaged in some publishing, and Barbara Harrison founded and         ran the bookstore &quot;Harrison of Paris.&quot; Between them, these women         were responsible for publishing Joyce&#146;s <i>Portrait of an Artist</i>         and <i>Ulysses</i>, and first books by Moore, Williams, Hemingway, and         Beckett, as well as later works by Stein, Joyce, Lawrence, Eliot, and         of course, each other.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women were also involved         in cooperative or collaborative editing with men, although here it is         far less clear how much influence the women had. Lola Ridge, for example,         worked with Kreymborg on <i>Others</i> between 1915 and 1919, taking on         assistant editorial responsibilities especially after 1917. Bryher provided         the money, and she and H.D. provided the impetus for Contact Press&#146;s         publication of Moore&#146;s <i>Poems</i>, although the Contact Press was         formally run by Bryher&#146;s husband, Robert McAlmon, and was associated         with his and Williams&#146; journal, <i>Contact</i>. To our knowledge,         no research has been done on either H.D.&#146;s or Bryher&#146;s influence         on other publications of the press or in the journal. Similarly, Bryher         founded the film journal, <i>Close-Up</i>, with Kenneth Macpherson and         managed its editorial office (1927-1933), but it has only lately become         clear through unpublished correspondence that her position involved significant         editorial decision-making (Marek 118). In 1925, Ethel Moorhead financed         and helped set up <i>This Quarter</i> with Ernest Walsh, who was then         also assisted by Kay Boyle for two issues. In 1926, Gwendolyn Bennett,         Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Huges, and others founded the avant-garde         magazine, <i>Fire</i>, which published only one issue. Because many of         these women including masthead editors like Moore downplayed their own         influence and direction, encouraged their male collaborators or employees         to take credit for joint work, or didn&#146;t protest when joint work         was interpreted as &quot;his&quot; (with her &quot;help&quot;), it is         still difficult to sort out precisely what roles various women played         in the collaborative editing of this period. As perhaps requires reiteration,         men also founded and edited important journals during this period&#150;most         notably Kreymborg&#146;s <i>Others</i>, McAlmon and Williams&#146; <i>Contact</i>,         Ford and Pound&#146;s <i>The Transatlantic Review</i> (also financed in         part by Stella Bowen and John Quinn), and Eliot&#146;s <i>The Criterion</i>.         Arguably, however, these journals did not have the cumulative pioneering         effect of <i>Poetry</i>, <i>The Little Review</i>, and <i>The Dial</i>.         It is not necessarily that women edited more experimentalist journals         but that those they did edit were so influential and successful.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In both the U.S.         and England, the women involved in editing encountered many obstacles,         not the least of which was jockeying by men to take over the direction         of their journals through heavy-handed advising (not through taking on         the editorial labor themselves). <a href="#4">[4]</a> It was finally,         however, the depression of the early 1930s that marked the end of this         extraordinary phenomenon and of the proliferation of experimentally oriented         &quot;little magazines&quot; generally. <a href="#5">[5]</a> Nothing like         this early twentieth-century dominance of women in avant-garde editing         has occurred since, although there are noteworthy similarities now at         the end of the century.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">While these modernist         women were unusually talented and self-assured, historical conditions         help explain the rise of this phenomenon. First, these women were following         a well-established pattern. In the U.S., women had been prominently involved         in editing and publishing since the mid-nineteenth century. The most popular         magazine in the U.S. for decades was edited by Sarah Josepha Hale, who         began editing her own journal, the <i>Ladies Magazine</i> in 1828, which         she merged with Godey&#146;s <i>Ladies Book</i> in 1837 and then edited         for forty years. On the more intellectual front, Margaret Fuller was the         first and primary editor of the <i>Dial</i> from 1840-1842 (it folded         in 1844). Elizabeth Peabody published <i>The Dial</i> from 1841-1843,         and in 1849 founded and edited the <i>Aesthetic Papers</i>.<a href="#6">[6]</a>         Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin founded, published, and edited the first newspaper         for African American women, the <i>Woman&#146;s Era</i> in Boston from         1890-1897, and Ida B. Wells was an extremely influential journalist, who         published and edited four newspapers between 1891 and 1913.<a href="#7">[7]</a>         Thus, the women editing journals dedicated to avant-garde literature in         the teens and twenties had rich precedents for their activity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Second, by the turn         of the century, American and British women had legal rights to own property,         control their wages, and conduct their own businesses. This was key to         their success in the marketplace. In comparison, in Germany, where women         did not enjoy similar rights, no woman founded or edited a single literary         journal (experimental or not) during this period. The number of heiresses         supporting the arts through direct funding to artists and support to publishing         ventures may also have had a direct impact on women&#146;s roles in this         field. Female writer-editors received financial contributions from, among         others, Bryher, Peggy Guggenheim, Charlotte Mason, and Harriet Moody,         and individual editors received aid from several others&#150;for example,         Monroe from Edith Rockefeller McCormick and Bertha Palmer.<a href="#8">[8]</a>         While poet-editors like Monroe also received substantial donations from         men, others like Moore received financial assistance only from women.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Third, in the U.S.,         the increased access of higher education to women in the late nineteenth         century&#150;primarily through women&#146;s colleges&#150;gave rise to         a powerful class of women who were encouraged to discard nineteenth-century         expectations about women&#146;s abilities and place, and to think of themselves         as intellectually and professionally equal to men. As Carol Smith-Rosenberg         has documented, these graduates were extraordinarily successful in entering         and creating various fields of professional employment, maintaining strong         networks to help each other, and in fundamentally altering traditionally         gendered modes of life. Of those completing a college degree near the         turn of the century from a women&#146;s college, relatively few married         (in comparison with the population of the U.S. generally), almost all         achieved financial independence, and many entered fields of employment         where they could direct, counsel, or teach younger women to follow similarly         professional paths. In Britain, academically oriented women&#146;s high         schools as well as women&#146;s colleges have served a similar purpose.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although not all         the women editing avant-garde journals completed college degrees, many         spent some time there or in private girls schools, and&#150;like college         graduates&#150;most were self-supporting and either did not marry or had         unconventional marriages; many organized their lives around relationships         with women&#150;some lesbian, some familial or professional.<a href="#9">[9]</a>         Networks of women were formed in other venues, too. For example, in Chicago,         Monroe was part of a powerful network of professional or monied women,         including among her friends and supporters (as well as McCormick and Palmer)         Jane Addams, Florence Kelly, Margaret Sullivan (literary editor of the         <i>Chicago Herald</i>), Ellen Peattie (literary editor of the Chicago         <i>Tribune</i>), and Helen Starrett and Antoinette von Wakeman, who founded         and edited their own &quot;weekly news/literary journals.&quot; <a href="#10">[10]</a>         While many of these women did not practice or hold principles that would         today be called feminist they were strongly conscious that, as Moore put         it, &quot;men have power/and sometimes one is made to feel it&quot;(&quot;Marriage&quot;),         and they were determined to succeed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Looking at the twentieth         century, one is struck by how much the social conditions of women have         changed. Remarkably, however, these privileged women at the turn of the         century had a confidence in their abilities comparable to those of women         today.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Probably the biggest         difference between the 1920s and 1990s in the publishing of innovative         poetry is that there is so much more of it now than there was then. We         have the modernists partly to thank for this, since one of their strongest         legacies in the U.S. has been the development of poetic trends and communities         via small press ventures, especially little magazines. This legacy was         crucial to the mid-century development of the &quot;New American&quot;         poetries. In recent years, the easy availability of Xerox and the advent         of desktop and electronic publishing have supported a further explosion         in alternative publishing venues. No longer dependent so exclusively on         journals for early publications, avant-garde writers have had access to         numbers of book presses unimaginable to the modernists. The 1998-99 edition         of Dustbooks <i>International Directory of Little Magazines &amp; Small         Presses</i> proudly announces listing &quot;Over 6,000 Markets for Writers!&quot;         The same company&#146;s <i>Directory of Poetry Publishers</i> proclaims         &quot;Over Two Thousand Poetry Markets!&quot; Many of the presses or magazines         catalogued in these sources have arisen out of particular communities         and respond to the tastes or needs of distinct audiences. The vast small         press/small magazine literary scene in the 1990s, then, is thoroughly         decentralized and often balkanized, though individual writers may straddle         several writing communities and publish in journals directed at different         readerships. In contrast, reflecting the changed class structure of American         society, external funding possibilities are at once more centralized (in         government and a few large granting agencies) and more elusive than in         the twenties, with fewer wealthy patrons now willing to support experimental         publishing.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even the listings         in such massive references as the Dustbooks<i> Directory of Little Magazines         and Small Presses</i> prove far from comprehensive when it comes to avant-garde         publishing. O Books doesn&#146;t appear in the Dustbooks <i>Directory</i>;         nor does Tuumba, Tender Buttons, Roof, Littoral, <i>Chain</i>, <i>Idiom</i>,         <i>Clamour</i>, Chax, <i>o-blek</i>, Leave books, or Sun &amp; Moon. Yet         Talisman, Potes &amp; Poets Press, Kelsey Street, Sulfur, Post-Apollo         Press, and Burning Deck all do appear in that same directory. Inclusion         apparently reflects the preferences of the small press or magazine editors,         since the annual directory contains a prominent invitation to contact         Dustbooks in order to list a magazine or press in future editions. Inclusion         and exclusion seem more chancy in compilations like Spencer Selby&#146;s         lengthy listing for the Buffalo Website of current &quot;Experimental         Poetry/Art Magazines.&quot; Given the vast number of current publishing         projects and the limitations of existing reference materials pertaining         to them, it is difficult to get an accurate overview of what is happening         in alternative poetry publishing.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Despite that, from         our perspective as academics we will hazard some generalizations about         gender and avant-garde publishing today. To begin with the obvious: women         are now tremendously important to avant-garde publishing, as would be         apparent merely from a list of the publications directed by women speaking         at this conference. Those female-led presses that have existed long enough         to have put out a relatively large number of books&#150;O Books or Tuumba,         say&#150;have played particularly prominent roles in shaping the current         scene.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet women do not         dominate in avant-garde publishing as they did in the modernist period.         Women appear far less frequently than men as editors in Selby&#146;s list         of experimental literary magazines. And the book presses that now handle         the largest volume of experimentalist titles in poetry&#150;including         Sun &amp; Moon, Potes &amp; Poets, Talisman&#150;are run by men, or, as         with Burning Deck, by women and men jointly. Perhaps women&#146;s less         exclusive leadership as publishers in the &#145;90s is a consequence partly         of their more equal participation and recognition as innovative poets,         although the number of editors in the &#145;20s who were also writers         (whether or not we now think of them in those terms) mitigates against         easy generalizations.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">More certainly, the         level of women&#146;s involvement in experimentalist publishing in the         &#145;90s has been affected by the nature of recent feminist movements         in the U.S. The one area of poetry publishing where women clearly dominate         involves the kind of poetry widely recognized as feminist and/or as lesbian         because of its &quot;content&quot;&#150;its personal and accessible voice-based         testimony about individual women&#146;s lives. To recast this point slightly:         many of the women who are involved in American small press literary publishing         today devote themselves to projects that aspire to be socially revolutionary,         often around gender issues, but without necessary links to formal or linguistic         innovation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It&#146;s not surprising,         then, that women&#146;s contributions to experimental poetry publication         today are not well recognized in current scholarly narratives. Because         American academic feminism has generally allied itself with an identity         politics focus, and because the greatest impetus for reading, teaching,         and publishing works by women has come from feminist scholars, the view         from academe tends to obscure women&#146;s publishing that does not fit         this mold. Thus, Kim Whitehead&#146;s scholarly study, <i>The Feminist         Poetry Movement </i>(published in 1996)<i>, </i>assumes that there is         only one feminist poetry movement, best represented by Minnie Bruce Pratt,         June Jordan, Judy Grahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Irena Klepfisz, and Joy Harjo.         In her brief survey of feminist press production Whitehead does mention         one Kelsey Street title (Nellie Wong&#146;s <i>Dreams in Harrison Railroad         Park</i>), but she seems generally unaware of publishing ventures that         exhibit versions of feminism concerned with the gendered implications         of literary conventions and linguistic structures themselves. There&#146;s         no evidence that Whitehead even knows of the existence of as important         a feminist publication as <i>HOW(ever)</i>. Similarly, Cynthia G. Franklin&#146;s         1997 study, <i>Writing Women&#146;s Communities: The Politics and Poetics         of Contemporary Multi-Genre Anthologies,</i> typifies academic feminist         writing in focussing on identity politics as constitutive of women&#146;s         communities in literature.<a href="#11">[11]</a> While Franklin foregrounds         the politics of her choices, she does not acknowledge that such a focus         elides meaningful coalitions that develop around aesthetics, perhaps coupled         with particular social concerns. Ironically, then and this is only to         update a story that Kathleen Fraser told years ago in her essay, &quot;The         Tradition of Marginality&quot;&#150;the rise of certain kinds of feminist         publishing has tended to further marginalize experimentalist feminist         production in the academic world as in the publishing one.<a href="#12">[12]</a>         It has contributed especially to the invisibility of the women of color         whose experimentalist work resists fulfilling conventional expectations         for work that &quot;represents&quot;&#150;in the sense both of representational         aesthetics and of demographic representativeness&#150;cultural diversity.         <a href="#13">[13]</a> </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To the extent that         men are more visibly powerful forces in avant-garde poetry publishing         of the 1990s than women, scholarly narration of recent literary history         could easily obscure or even overlook women&#146;s nurturing of current         experimentalism, especially women&#146;s importance to the earliest stages         of particular poets&#146; careers. Indeed, as experimentalist work is         more institutionalized within academe, the nature and importance of the         small press network involving men as well as women may be increasingly         overlooked. Consider, for example, the career of Susan Howe, one of the         best known female experimentalist writers of our day whose work is being         studied with increasing frequency in college and university classes. Someone         coming to Susan Howe&#146;s work for the first time today encounters her         as a poet published by New Directions, Wesleyan University Press, and         by Sun &amp; Moon in its &quot;Classics&quot; series&#150;the most established         of the presses open to experimentalist work. Now that New Directions has         published <i>Frame Structures: Early Poems, 1974-1979</i>, scholars need         not cite the small presses that first produced those early works or learn         who their editors were. Especially because successful mainstream poets         usually place their first books with a recognized university or trade         press, or perhaps with one of the well known smaller presses such as Gray         Wolf, Ecco, or Copper Canyon, academic readers (usually familiar with         mainstream career patterns) are not likely to attribute much importance         to the early small press publications. Such oversights are potentially         distorting not only of literary history but of the work itself: in Howe&#146;s         case, for instance, the early printings of &quot;The Liberties&quot; or         &quot;The Articulation of Sound Forms in Time&quot; are truer to her vision         for those poems on the page than the versions available now from more         established presses.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Having talked with         Susan Howe recently about her early publication history, we&#146;d like         to summarize her story because it provides useful object lessons for us.<a href="#14">[14]</a>         Howe&#146;s first publisher was Maureen Owen, whom she met through a workshop         at St. Marks, and whose Telephone Books printed <i>Hinge Picture</i> in         1974, helping Susan gain confidence as she moved from painting to poetry.         Telephone Books also published <i>Secret History of the Dividing Line</i>         in 1978. &quot;I wonder if my work would have been published at all if         it weren&#146;t for Maureen,&quot; Susan remarked. Other women who stuck         their necks out to publish her as an unknown writer include Lyn Hejinian,         whose Tuumba press published <i>The Western Borders</i> in 1976, Lita         Hornick of Kulchur Foundation who published <i>Defenestration of Prague</i>         in 1983 with assistance from Susan Bee, and Brita Bergland whose Awede         Press published <i>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time</i> in 1989, before         it was collected (in significantly modified form) in Wesleyan&#146;s <i>Singularities.         </i> Susan found in these women not only the willingness to labor on behalf         of an unknown writer, but also important sensitivity to her needs for         page space and blank space. Yet she was also quick to note that men, too,         took chances on her early work. She expressed gratitude especially to         Eliot Weinberger, who published <i>Pythagorean Silence</i> in 1982, and         who &quot;backed and encouraged [her] every step of the way with <i>My         Emily Dickinson,</i>&quot; which Richard Grossinger published in 1985.         Nor did she regard sensitivity to space needs as a gender-linked gift:         Gale Nelson, for instance, did a beautiful job with the Paradigm Books         printing of the unusual textual arrangements of <i>A Bibliography of the         King&#146;s Book</i>.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The interweaving         of women and men and of chance in avant-garde publishing is epitomized         in Susan Howe&#146;s tale of a publication that proved crucial to her         reputation: the first version of <i>The Liberties, </i>which she herself         produced in tandem with Maureen Owen under the ad hoc imprint of Loon         Press. Howe and Owen mimeographed copies of this poem on the St. Mark&#146;s         mimeo machine and sent them to people they thought might be interested,         among them John Taggart. Taggart left his copy out for Robert Duncan to         see when Duncan came to visit. Duncan read the poem, loved it, and started         writing to everyone about it. His generous recommendation significantly         enlarged the audience for Howe&#146;s work, especially in California.         He also arranged for her to give three lectures on Emily Dickinson at         New College, encouraging her to share and pursue her thinking about Dickinson.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Howe&#146;s complicated         story of gender and publishing reminds us that the nurturing of much recent         experimentalist writing has depended on page fathers as well as page mothers.         (We could note, for instance, that other female experimentalists, such         as Beverly Dahlen, also benefited from Duncan&#146;s generosity in advancing         their careers.) In recent decades, as at the beginning of the century,         women and men have in various ways collaborated to foster experimentalist         work.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the same time,         Howe&#146;s history speaks to the crucial role women have frequently played         in giving a start to today&#146;s experimentalist writers, as was so often         the case in the &#145;20s&#150;a role that may easily be obscured with         the writers&#146; canonization and with their moves to more established         presses. We noted earlier that it has taken several decades of both feminist         scholarship and study of modernism to uncover women&#146;s importance         to publishing at the beginning of the century. It would be a terrible         waste if the contributions of today&#146;s female editors were similarly         buried. It has been our hope in this presentation that recalling the publishing         history of our modernist predecessors may help clarify what is and isn&#146;t         distinctive about the gender dynamics of recent patterns of networking,         influence, responsibility, and collaboration in avant-garde publishing.         Moreover, looking back at the history of modernist poetry and its scholarship         reminds us that those of us working as scholars of the contemporary period         need to record the complicated networks of recent publishing, being especially         vigilant to see that the women whose courage and vision often led to experimentalists&#146;         early publications get the credit due them.</font></p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="148" height="386" valign="top"></td>    <td width="4" height="386" valign="top"></td>    <td height="386" colspan="7" valign="top"><font face="Times">       <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>ENDNOTES</b></font></p>      </font>       <dir>         <p>&#9;Much of the information of this essay derives from the work of           other scholars over the past fifteen years, foremost among them Jayne           E.

In addition, all these men were in some sense at the           mercy of entrepreneurial female editors like Harriet Monroe, Jane Heap,           Margaret Anderson, Dora Marsden, and Marianne Moore.
