      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. <u>Too much literature</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thirteenth-century 
        Margery Kemp&#150;a successful businesswoman, lusty wife, and mother of 
        many children had what seems to be a mid-life crisis. She wept profusely 
        at her visions of Jesus, went off on pilgrimages, exhausted her fellow 
        pilgrims with her plaintive weeping, and risked heresy in her numerous 
        premature bids for sanctity, which were continuously refused her. But 
        she did enter the literary canon through her written record, her written 
        complaint regarding her love for Jesus and her need to be a Saint. She 
        didn&#146;t get what she wanted but she did something that &quot;we&quot; 
        wanted. &quot;We,&quot; this provisional literary <i>sensus communus</i>, 
        transformed the self-appointment into art.</font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus one can 
            and cannot name oneself a saint.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Everything is 
            always changing.</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Including the value(s) 
        or meanings in our time of certain writers such as Sappho or Ezra Pound. 
        When Page DuBois asserts that Sappho made love a philosophical category, 
        she changes the patriarchal canon by inserting desire, not only through 
        her reinterpretation of Sappho&#146;s writing but by exposing the devices 
        for canon formation. That philosophy and poetry are separate categories 
        is a construction. DuBois utilizes a feminist Desire to reform canonical 
        readings of Sappho and in so doing she alters genre categories that privilege 
        philosophy over poetry. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I want to &quot;master&quot; 
        all sides of this question. All of the relationships between poetry and 
        philosophy. This is power. Why do I/we love power? (The love of power 
        being [a] <i>little fascist in all of us</i>.<a href="#1">[1]</a>) What 
        I want is not possible. There is too much literature.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. <u>Modernism and 
        Power, Post-modernism and Politics</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[&quot;Pablo &amp; 
        Matisse have a maleness that belongs to genius. <i>Moi aussi</i>&#133;perhaps&quot;<a href="#2">[2]</a> 
        ]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Self-nomination is 
        terribly unattractive, don&#146;t you think? Is there a point at which 
        pushing one&#146;s way into the world does not turn into self-nomination? 
        Did not T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound self-nominate? Did not H.D. self-nominate? 
        Although she did not murder her child, she gave it over and, like Agamemnon, 
        she absented herself to the Trojan situation, island-hopping through her 
        undone and rather abstruse loyalties and disloyalties to antique deities. 
        These she resurrected, refashioned, and loved unlinked from the commune 
        of profane domesticity. Female self-naming is always tainted. It suggests 
        fakery, abandonment, that old nineteenth-century hysteria.<a href="#3">[3]</a> 
        It suggests biography rather than a life lived in symbolic acts. Or female 
        self-naming identifies that which is tainted in the act of patriarchal 
        appointment, self-appointment or otherwise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I didn&#146;t mean 
        this essay to be going in this direction: it just slipped out. As an image 
        suggested itself to me. That of Guiellermo Gomez-Pena and Roberto Sifuentes 
        disguised as the robbers crucified alongside Jesus and affixed to crosses 
        on a Marin County Californian beach as a 1994 art protest against then-governor, 
        Pete Wilson&#146;s &quot;xenophobic immigration politics.&quot; Gomez-Pena 
        writes:</font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our audience 
            of over 300 people each received a handout, asking them to &quot;free 
            us from our martyrdom as a gesture of political commitment.&quot; 
            However, we had miscalculated their response. Paralyzed by the melancholia 
            of the image, it took them over three hours to figure out how to get 
            us down&#133;We were carried to a nearby bonfire and nurtured back 
            to reality, while some people in the crowd rebuked those who were 
            trying to help us, saying &quot;Let them die!&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Photographs of 
            the event were quickly picked up by the media, and the piece became 
            international news&#133;(102-103)</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although I do not 
        entirely doubt that melancholia moved the crowd to paralysis, I also can&#146;t 
        help but imagine that there was something in addition to the mournful 
        affect of the performed image conditioning the crowd&#146;s response&#150;the 
        experience of being a passive audience in those secular religious situations 
        preserved and presenced in art galleries, museums, and theaters to name 
        those institutions most linked to the construction of disinterested contemplation 
        of aesthetic/cultural objects. And here the artist had superimposed himself, 
        affixed himself as a symbol to <i>the </i>symbol of the cross, such that 
        he became exemplary in the way, a secular way, a Christ or a robber on 
        a crucifix is exemplary as an aesthetic artifact, as something taken out 
        of a religious hegemonic context and put into a secular hegemonic context. 
        Even if there were no museum walls framing the work, the work may have 
        invoked the conditions that a traditional museum context places on artifacts. 
        In any case, Gomez Pena was attempting to make public in relationship 
        to a symbolic social hierarchy the circumstance of the &quot;robber&quot; 
        (read the racialized underclass) using the iconography of sanctity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And isn&#146;t this 
        mythic melancholia, as it resonates within an originary event, a response 
        to hostility? In the biblical mythic time, those who would take the robbers 
        down from the cross would be scorned, ridiculed, doomed. I assume then 
        that the hostile element in this present crowd is significant. Doesn&#146;t 
        this present hostility also produce the present melancholia and inertia? 
        It must function as a prohibition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Can new meaning fit 
        into old forms?<a href="#4">[4]</a> In this case, what is an old form? 
        Maybe the answer here lies in how old the old form is, how under-used 
        or ubiquitous, how available for re-use. The Pena/Sifuentes piece is full 
        of semi-positive outcomes and semi-negative charges. Here, hierarchy (old 
        forms) and democracy (&quot;new meaning&quot; or a pixilation of power 
        which unevenly distributes and charges among partly passive/partly active 
        subjects) meet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What I am trying 
        to show is that there is a complex relationship between hierarchic signs 
        and democratic impulses and that the inactivity or &quot;useless&quot; 
        activity (silence of the crowd) is related to the hierarchic model of 
        both spiritual melancholia and aesthetic &quot;disinterest&quot; as it 
        tries to enter an idealized democratization based on action. The polemical 
        allegory of the work of art is that if you can get &quot;us&quot; down 
        from the cross, you can discover your own political agency. But that allegory 
        is nevertheless connected to the pacifying image of the cross, the necessary 
        hostility of the onlookers, and the contemplative demand of the traditional 
        work of art.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I admire the Sifuentes/Pena 
        artwork and think there is value in Pena&#146;s ability to interpret his 
        works in a way that the political agency of the work outlives (at least, 
        to some extent) the art. However, I question Pena&#146;s <i>subordinating</i> 
        of some people&#146;s political animosity to his narrative that preserves 
        an aura of sanctity in its representations of the crowd&#146;s &quot;melancholia&quot; 
        as the cause of the group&#146;s inability to act. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In all of her writing 
        but quite manifestly in &quot;War/Poverty/Writing,&quot; Leslie Scalapino 
        replaces subordination in narrative re-presentation with &quot;present 
        time.&quot; &quot;The connection to oneself is dropped.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So that one can see.<a href="#5">[5]</a> 
        Can one also imagine being seen in this manner?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Does recognition 
        exist in the &quot;unfreedom&quot; of society, where as in seeing and 
        in making &quot;the connection to oneself is dropped?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet, the desire for 
        recognition (for what one, for instance, has produced in the making) is 
        the desire to be recognized precisely, to be named correctly, to have 
        one&#146;s concerns represented properly. This too is impossible in a 
        hierarchic model of canonicity which is constructed on the basis of hegemonic 
        misrecognitions and in the preservation of categories that for instance 
        draw relations between artists and saints.<a href="#6">[6]</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A problem for the 
        artist is that &quot;true&quot; recognition also means exposure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. <u>Eroticism, 
        Solitude, and Philosophy</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his 1955 essay, 
        &quot;Sanctity, Eroticism, and Solitude,&quot; George Bataille (both philosopher 
        and novelist) writes, &quot;Just now I shall be content to look at the 
        emotion of sanctity on the one hand and at the emotion of eroticism on 
        the other, in so far as each has extreme intensity. My meaning is that 
        with these two emotions one brings us closer to other men and the other 
        cuts us off from them and leaves us in solitude.&quot; &quot;&#133;the 
        philosophical experience as such excludes both these emotions.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Writing/poetry, that 
        medium of language&#150;Eros and knowledge&#150;Eros leaves one in solitude. 
        The <i>desire </i>for canonicity requires, if one follows Bataille&#146;s 
        model of intensity, a paradoxical relationship to the erotic: that one 
        give Eros up in order to be brought &quot;closer to men.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Within this model, 
        philosophy or criticism or surveillance or witnessing or describing a 
        primary text or theory or the kind of presentation which I am now engaged 
        in as I speak this text in public does not exist in the sacred time of 
        intensity but in profane/daily/work time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Within Bataille&#146;s 
        hierarchic model, in order for the primary writing to speak for itself, 
        in spite of all the/its assertions that it does speak for itself, the 
        reader must enter the intensity of the writing. This is both pleasurable 
        and difficult and sometimes impossible for the reader must be willing 
        to accept its exposure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In my experience, 
        teaching writing by women can be difficult. Is this because the erotic 
        or sensual impulse of the writing is represented within the profane domicile 
        of work? So that working in the law office, the fields, the stage agency, 
        the school, the kitchen brings one in proximity to philosophy? In that 
        case, Bataille&#146;s hierarchic model&#150;in which philosophy is aligned 
        with profane (work) time and erotic time is aligned with sanctity&#150;falters 
        when it comes to the consideration of the aesthetic projects of women 
        in which structures of time do not fall easily into a hierarchic mode. 
        It is from such a perspective that I offer the following section from 
        Gwendolyn Brooks&#146; <i>Maud Martha</i>:</font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Maud Martha was 
            fighting with a chicken. The nasty, nasty mess. It had been give a 
            bitter slit with the bread knife and the bread knife had been biting 
            in that vomit-looking interior for almost five minutes without being 
            able to detach certain resolute parts from their walls. The bread 
            knife had it all to do, as Maud Martha had no intention of putting 
            her hand in there. Another hack&#150;another hack&#150;STUFF! Splat 
            in her eye. She leaped at the faucet.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">She thought she 
            had praise coming to her. She was doing this job with less stomach-curving 
            than ever before. She thought of the times before the war, when there 
            was more chickens than people wanting to buy them, and butchers were 
            happy to clean them, and even cut them up. None of that now&#133;Now 
            meat was jewelry and she was practically out of Red Points. You were 
            lucky to find a chicken. She had to be as brave as she could.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">People do this! 
            People could cut a chicken open, take out the mess, with bare hands 
            or a bread knife, pour water in, as in a bag, pour water out, shake 
            the corpse by neck or by legs, free the straggles of water. Could 
            feel that insinuating slipping bone, survey that soft, that headless 
            death. The fainthearted could do it. But if the chicken were a man!--cold 
            man with no head or feet and with all the little feather&#150;er, 
            hairs to be pulled, and the intestines loosened and beginning to ooze 
            out, and the gizzard yet to be grabbed and the stench beginning to 
            rise! And yet the chicken was a sort of person, a respectable individual, 
            with its own kind of dignity. The difference is in the knowing. What 
            was unreal to you, you could deal with violently. If chickens were 
            ever to be safe, people would have to live with them, and know them, 
            see them loving their children, finishing the evening meal, arranging 
            jealousy.</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In her well-known 
        essay, &quot;&#145;The Darkened Eyes Restored&#146;: Notes Toward a Literary 
        History of Black Women,&quot; Mary Helen Washington recounts that when 
        Gwendolyn Brooks received the Pullitzer prize, the event was resented.(30-31) 
        <i>Maud Martha</i>, written three years later, was characterized by a 
        reviewer as written by &quot;a spunky and sophisticated Negro girl,&quot; 
        who, they said, had a marvelous &quot;ability to turn unhappiness and 
        anger into a joke.&quot;(31)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A question is: Whose 
        goal is it to usher anything into the canon? And how, as a writer to engage 
        actively and publicly in literary practice without turning oneself over 
        to false representations? I am by the way talking less about achieving 
        public fame or notoriety than I am about fantasy structures of power that 
        are silencing, that prevent writers for instance from addressing critically 
        their own and other writers&#146; works. Women must be able to speak critically 
        and analytically about each other&#146;s and others&#146; (men&#146;s, 
        writers&#146; different from &quot;herself,&quot; critics&#146;, and theorists&#146;) 
        works or we will be misrecognized. However, if such writing <i>about</i> 
        is <i>about</i> canon-formation, then the misrecognitions will persist 
        along with an endless series of misnamings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What I mean in the 
        most simple sense here is that the writing <i>about</i> needs to attend 
        carefully to difference, to awkwardness, to misfittings rather than to 
        have as a primary goal the fitting of the &quot;innovative&quot; text 
        into conventional categories. After all, the power of the &quot;different&quot; 
        text lies in what it suggests about other ways of seeing and imagining 
        writing. If one wants the implication of a vision to develop, then fitting 
        the radical object into the square peg of patriarchal canon-making narratives 
        is not only an inaccurate way of proceeding but one that reinforces values 
        that the art object itself critiques. I do not mean that mediating language 
        is not necessary for creating readings of and preserving writing but that 
        reductive readings that are about norms and values the texts themselves 
        reject or call into question can produce a kind of textual powerlessness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So, how do &quot;we&quot; 
        do this without falling into devotional terms asks Kathleen Fraser. In 
        her well-known &quot;Cyborg Manifesto,&quot; Donna Haraway proposes irreverance, 
        blasphemy, and wit in the context of feminist political and cultural practices. 
        The reflections and reflexivities that these terms imply suggest healthy 
        antidotes to &quot;the sacred&quot; (and neutered) text as object of traditional 
        literary canon-making.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is sometimes 
        a sad, confusing, ineffective anxiety about legitimacy that <i>can</i> 
        be over-written. Does this anxiety have to do with the condition of being 
        returned to silence? Returned to writing? If one is always only returning 
        to writing (with other forms of work as discounted, discontinued), profane 
        time is replaced only by sacred time and then the meaning of sacred time 
        becomes chaos. Or, the withdrawal from public discussion that occurs because 
        it is not possible to meet its terms, its pre-existing categories&#150;those 
        experiences that are either actually silencing or that makes one feel 
        silenced&#150;become identical to the desire for solitude. The erotic 
        space of writing is then in part occupied by a negative reaction to public 
        space. If not chaos, a knot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. SILENCE</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A tangle of knots.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[Alice fascinated 
        by the length of the mouse&#146;s tail, watches it unfold as a series 
        of &quot;bends.&quot; Dimly, she hears him remark: &quot;We know that 
        the unconscious castration complex has the function of a knot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;A knot!&quot; 
        said Alice, all ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about 
        her. &quot;Oh, do let me help to undo it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;I shall do 
        nothing of the sort,&quot; said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;I didn&#146;t 
        mean it,&quot; pleaded poor Alice. &quot;But you&#146;re so easily offended, 
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mouse only growled 
        in reply.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And here is poor 
        Alice on the Freudian couch&#133;Alice, <i>c&#146;est moi</i>?] <a href="#7">[7]</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When I use the word 
        &quot;woman&quot; as in Women&#146;s Studies, I am talking about a class 
        of people who have a subordinated relationship to power. One of the conditions 
        of this power in respect to literature is the concept of women&#146;s 
        voices being silenced. Particularly in the area of African American literary 
        studies, there has been an examination of the process of suppression of 
        the idea of women artists and the production of an expanding narrative 
        of re-presentation of not only texts but the event of black feminine creativity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">[Contrary to what 
        we might expect, black holes are full, not empty&#133;The idea of a black 
        hole as a process&#150;as a progression that appears differently, or not 
        at all, from various perspectives&#150;seems a useful way of illustrating 
        how I conceive of incommensurability, or variations on negation, as characteristic 
        of black feminist creativity.] <a href="#8">[8]</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is another 
        problem of silence, of the Eros of writing. Writing by women working in 
        &quot;new forms&quot; is difficult. It can appear with &quot;variations 
        on negation&quot; for instance. Women of color, white women, working-class 
        women have in common variations on a different relationship to power, 
        and this makes &quot;us&quot; hard to read. Reading is conditioned by 
        patriarchal teleological designs on texts. The writing then is incommensurate 
        with ways in which reading is learned. I am not only talking about the 
        privileging of transparency, coherence, wholeness, argumentation, but 
        also of the relationship that women make to philosophical modes of discourse. 
        Hence, it was very difficult for students in Women&#146;s Studies to understand 
        that when Acker or Retallack use the figure I/eye, they are not simply 
        referencing Laura Mulvey&#146;s construction of the male gaze in <i>Visual 
        and Other Pleasures</i> but are writing about the visual in relationship 
        to a non-stationary I/eye, not an oppressive eye. In other words, it is 
        difficult for them to understand that the &quot;other&quot; has positive 
        agency and is in fact producing these texts that construct new modes of 
        thinking, seeing, and writing. The comfortable position for the reader 
        is that of a critical reactivity. So the &quot;patriarchal&quot; conditioning 
        of the &quot;critical&quot; reader (as opposed to the &quot;passive&quot; 
        reader) is to put her in a position of reactivity. If one only reacts 
        to a text based on prior knowledge, one cannot read it. Any feminist discourse 
        can be conditioned to modes of patriarchal reading.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">So, the concept of 
        silence slips. It becomes being silenced by phallic signification. It 
        becomes lack. Is this the same silence that the writer is returned within 
        the intensity of writing? My answer is no. It is not the same silence. 
        But one is conditioned to experience &quot;being silenced&quot; with the 
        eroticism of writing poetry. Abjection, resentment, competitiveness, and 
        envy rise from the confusion of the intensities of two different forms 
        of subordination (e.g. the giving oneself over to the solitude of writing 
        and social subordination, erasure, etc. within a hierarchic regime) both 
        of which are subsumed in the same word. Or pair of words: silence, solitude. 
        Where silence for women is thought of as oppression and solitude is a 
        form of freedom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">PROFANE TIME</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">(The other is not 
        only other and this is where we get away from hierarchy. The other knows 
        the law and can imitate the law and can sometimes be the law and something 
        other than the law. It is in profane time, the time of work, which in 
        the time of the other, is not categorically separate from eroticism. Yet, 
        it excludes an oppressive sanctity, including the unlimited claims of 
        knowledge which are visited on others and which demand one to give up 
        one&#146;s erotic situation for a sanctified neutrality.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I wonder, and this 
        is where I&#146;m going to leave off writing now, if the mixing of discourses 
        or the writing in different fields or genres (performative, oral, written, 
        political, poetic, philosophical, anthropological), such as in the works 
        of Zora Neale Hurston, Mina Loy, Suzan-Lori Parks, Leslie Scalapino, or 
        Ann Lauterbach (can I place these writers side by side?), is related to 
        a demand for recognition that does not desire sanctity as either 1) The 
        Poet 2) The Realist 3) The Superwoman (I want to pretend these formulations 
        are dead but they aren&#146;t really) but insists on a relationship between 
        the writing subject and the commonwealth that honors the potential power 
        of all or any members of the commonwealth who have been assigned the position 
        of alterity. If the other speaks and is speaking, the others can potentially 
        speak as well. But there is I think a psychological dimension to be addressed 
        as well. It may be that the poet/writer&#146;s ability to make use of 
        work such as philosophy (and skinning a chicken) allows her to mediate 
        psychologically between the near-chaos of solitude in writing (which is 
        also freedom) and the fear of non-recognition, misnaming, subordination, 
        silencing, and erasure.</font></p>
