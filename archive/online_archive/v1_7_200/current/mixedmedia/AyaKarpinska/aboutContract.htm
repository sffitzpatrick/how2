style='font-family:Arial'> is the second poem I have completed representing my
continued search for ways of using space to convey meaning and structure in
writing. How will the existence of computer-generated virtual space influence
writing practices? We have already seen how hypertext and hypermedia can expand
the possibilities for annotation of texts. Suppose we are reading an analysis
of Kurt Schwitters&#8217; <i>Ursonata</i> online. The text can link to a sound file
of Schwitters performing his work, a video clip of a recent interpretation of <i>Ursonata</i>,
or a bibliography linking to additional online texts. How would that same essay
change if the text could be represented in three dimensions? Perhaps individual
arguments of the analysis would show up as chunks of text floating in space,
with thin lines drawn between related points or cross-references. Sound files
could be arranged chronologically with contemporary performances of <i>Ursonata</i>
in the foreground and older ones further back. The reader&#8217;s position in the
space would trigger the appropriate sound clip. These are simple suggestions
regarding how the organization of a text could be manifested in
three-dimensional space. Yet I am also interested in spatialization of text on
a molecular level, how space can be used to modify the meaning of individual
words or phrases. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:Arial'>What
conventions can we retain from two-dimensional text, and what are the new
possibilities that can be exploited in a virtual space? In <i>contract</i>, I
follow the convention that words grouped closely together form a unit, a verse.
In all there are twenty-two verses. The subject matter of the text deals with
intra- and interpersonal communication through touch and motion. I was
fascinated by how many words involving the sense of touch imply motion &#8212;
gesture, creep, itch &#8212; how could you tickle someone without moving? One way I
thought to use space in the arrangement of the verses was an imaginary vertical
axis, with high points corresponding to verses concerning motion, and low
points corresponding to verses that concern touch. I was not entirely
scientific when placing verses on the touch-motion axis, however I did not want
the structure to be arbitrary, either. Working with the software I used to
create my three-dimensional model demanded that I think in a scientific way &#8212;
could not describe the way I wanted a particular word to hover above its
neighbor, I had to type in the exact x, y, and z coordinates. The tension
between the tools I use and the vision I have of a work is ever present. Who
knows, maybe I should have written each verse on a cube, thrown the collection
into the air, and taken a snapshot that would then become the model for the
poem&#8217;s three-dimensional structure. I am still learning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:Arial'>A
possibility afforded by virtual space that I focused on in <i>contract</i> is sound.
Erratic sound fragments taken from samples of my reading of the text enhance
the environment of the poem. The pauses in the music are like the white spaces
that surround the poem, an analogy between aural silence and what is left out
of a text. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
