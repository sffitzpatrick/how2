'><b>What is “innovative” after 9-11-01?: Reflections from the MSA 01 Conference</b></p>
<h1>Michael Bibby</h1>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>Signals Over the Net</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>What Elisabeth and Cynthia had originally proposed 
  was to conduct a roundtable discussion about the relationships between modernist 
  and contemporary poetics, and the idea was to circulate a list of questions 
  some time over the summer for Kathleen, Carla, and Lorenzo to respond to in 
  advance of the conference.  One of the first e-mails I received on this after 
  9-11-01 was from Elisabeth.</p>
<p>Dear Kathleen, Carla, &amp; Lorenzo,</p>
<p>On behalf of Michael, Cynthia &amp; myself, I’m sorry for being out of touch</p>
<p>for so long about our upcoming panel at MSA.  At the moment, it all seems</p>
<p>surreal &amp; irrelevant, especially here in NYC, where we are all only</p>
<p>beginning to absorb the ramifications of this last week.  I am enormously</p>
<p>lucky not to have been directly affected, but work remains difficult in</p>
<p>many ways.  My e-mail is not functioning at home; long distance calls</p>
<p>rarely go through; and a feeling of emergency prevails.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Here in south-central Pennsylvania, I felt a benumbed 
  and uncanny calm for days, even as the ROTC, which is housed in my office building, 
  was more animated and busy than I'd seen before—I saw lots of ROTC students 
  carrying guns and military hardware in and out of my building.  A ROTC student 
  in my Intro to Poetry class was more upset than I’d ever seen him, visibly shaking 
  as we discussed (by coincidence that week—it was just where the chapters ended 
  up in my intro textbook) Wilfred Owen—“the great lie.”</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Elisabeth’s e-mail continued:</p>
<p>The MSA conference seems to remain as planned.  As to our panel?  Perhaps a</p>
<p>broader perspective is in order.  Not just “modernism” but our future(s)?</p>
<p>Whatever the subjects of our conversation, we hope as much direction as</p>
<p>possible comes from the three of you.  Over the next day or so, we will</p>
<p>brainstorm some subjects &amp; questions.  We ask that the three of you look</p>
<p>back at the original proposal (pasted in below) &amp; use that as a point of</p>
<p>departure for a few issues/questions to be sent to me.  Michael &amp; I can</p>
<p>then organize the results &amp; send a copy to all of you in preparation for</p>
<p>our panel.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Kathleen, Carla, Lorenzo, and Cynthia soon followed 
  with responses.  Kathleen wondered about the viability of even doing the MSA 
  conference and questioned the need for more academic presentations in the face 
  of this historical situation.  But Lorenzo’s e-mail touched an especially strong 
  response in me.  He touched on how participating in the MSA might meet a pressing 
  need for community but also serve the need to act in the face of a growing intolerance, 
  a hysterical vertigo of machismo, the language of “enduring freedom,”and the 
  drumbeats for “eternal justice.”  He noted some striking historical parallels 
  between the situation for many radical and minority writers during the early 
  20<sup>th</sup> century in the wake of the Palmer raids which seemed precisely 
  to the point, especially given our panel’s original theme.  To what extent might 
  we think about the notion of modernist innovation as a response to the historical 
  experience of state-sponsored repression in the US and to the Palmer regime, 
  in particular?  Lorenzo was highlighting a dimension of African American modernism 
  I could not recall having been adequately examined.  The same day that Lorenzo 
  wrote, Carla’s response articulated both the sense of emergency so resonant 
  in those first days and a kind of immanent narrativity connecting the seemingly 
  disparate moments she related, offering some kind of suturing for what seemed 
  so damaging and fragmented.  Cynthia wrote out of her then current work on Marianne 
  Moore and the need for an ethical poetics.  I had just read Cynthia’s paper 
  on this topic, and it raised a number of issues I found quite compelling about 
  a commitment to a poetics of moral concern, of conduct.  As Sidney wrote in 
  <i>Apology for Poetry</i>: “The Ethicke and politick consideration, with the 
  end of well dooing and not of well knowing onely.”  How to write after historical 
  disaster, in the face of organized violence of the level of 9-11 (or of the 
  Red Summer, World War I, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, on &amp; on) in a way 
  that does not reiterate the epistemological shape of violence?  It’s an old 
  question.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Here’s my contribution to this e-mail discussion:</p>
<p>Lorenzo makes an important point . . . —perhaps we might consider along these 
  lines the baleful historicity confronting vanguard and/or oppositional poets 
  in this moment—the intensified calls to expand the reach of the Justice Dept, 
  the increased alliance between major internet providers and the FBI, the expansion 
  of the Bush administration’s targets, and the constant cries in the public discourse 
  for “retaliation” strongly suggest that we may be entering a period that bears 
  comparison to the early 20th C—</p>
<p>Can we focus the direction Lorenzo’s suggested in terms of the panel’s original</p>
<p class=MsoBlockText>proposal statement?  Here are some questions I’m brainstorming 
  after my morning caffeine jolt: How might we think of all “this,” of “911” and 
  the calls for war in connection with how modernist poetic radicalism relates 
  to contemporary</p>
<p>poetic experimentation?  How might the disruptiveness of modernist poetic</p>
<p>radicalism register the “disruption” in historical experience then (WW 1, the</p>
<p>Red Summer, the Palmer raids, etc.), and how might contemporary poets continue 
  to register those historical disruptions in their experiments with lyric and</p>
<p>narrative modes?  Do such contemporary practices extend, expand, &amp;/or diversify</p>
<p>what might be considered modernism’s staging of the poet as the voice of</p>
<p>historical disaster (perhaps a better word than disruption)?  Is the prevalence</p>
<p>of linguistic disruption in contemporary avant-garde poetry a reiteration of 
  the</p>
<p>initial and historically specific impulses in early 20th C modernism toward 
  a</p>
<p>re-presentation of historical traumas?  And if so, does it merely fall into 
  a</p>
<p>repetition historically inadequate to contemporary poetry’s own times? or does</p>
<p>it generalize early 20th C experiences of historical trauma as the tenor of</p>
<p>poetic experimentation?  How can the contemporary poet radicalize lyric and</p>
<p>narrative modes in ways specific to the historical moment of 911, geo-political</p>
<p>crisis, and transnational terror?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>My e-mail was an attempt to pick up on some threads 
  I’d sensed in previous e-mails as well as to return to a concern I felt had 
  been initially invoked presciently prior to 9-11 in the panel proposal Cynthia 
  and Elisabeth had written.  </p>
<p>Less commonly acknowledged . . . is the Modernist influence on other contemporary 
  poets, and how Modernist poetic radicalism has produced other kinds of experimentation 
  than the linguistic disruptions favored by Language theorist-poets.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>In the wake of 9-11 and the subsequent militaristic 
  hysteria which erupted throughout U.S. culture, my initial thoughts about the 
  relations between modernist and contemporary poetics kept coming back to the 
  incipient reification of violence that seemed so foundational to the narratives 
  of poetic experimentalism since1900: “the avant-garde,” “the vanguard,” the 
  radical break, rupture, disruption, fragmentation, “the shock of the new.”  
  This militaristic, violent language seems endemic to the criticism and history 
  of modernist poetics—even though it clearly only describes a particular poetics 
  (say Pound’s or Breton’s).  Certainly I don’t mean to suggest that such language 
  is the only way to represent “innovative” writing—but why does it seem so dominant?  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Obviously, as Lorenzo’s post reminded me, the rhetoric 
  of “ruptures” and “avant-garde” expresses a very different historical experience 
  of violence than those expressed by, say, Fenton Johnson, Jean Toomer, or Langston 
  Hughes.  While Paul Fussell and others have linked the modernist experimentation 
  of Pound, Eliot, et al. to the violences of World War I, as a kind of rearticulation 
  of those violences, it strikes me as a considerably different experience to 
  reify in poetic form the violences endured by others in war than to speak about 
  violence from the position of one violated or of one always historically the 
  target of violences foundational to the structure of one’s social existence—and 
  further, to speak about such experiences of violence at a time when to speak 
  this way risks violence itself.  As Lorenzo stated at the panel in Houston, 
  Fenton Johnson’s magazine was seized by the state under the Palmer regime.  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>At the same time, though, the violences of early 
  20<sup>th</sup> century history inscribed the pages of modernism because of 
  their overwhelming concrete presence everywhere in the social—I’m not suggesting 
  that Eliot’s or Pound’s relatively privileged positions meant that they were 
  not justified in registering the violences of their time—the loss of Wilfred 
  Owen, Gaudier-Brzeska, and other poets and artists, the everyday experience 
  of the maimed, the “demobbed” (<i>The Waste Land</i> but also <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>), 
  the pathetic patriotic conscription—it’s no wonder so many commentators focus 
  on modernist innovations as an expression of historical violence.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>But then I wondered, why must the particular forms 
  and modes of poetic experimentation which arose out of the historical experiences 
  of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century still manifest such a powerful relation 
  to the poetics of a postwar generation whose experiences of historical violence 
  have been qualitatively and quantitatively different, more generalized and more 
  systematized?  Must contemporary poetic experimentation necessarily express 
  its “newness,” for example, via syntactic breaks and the paratactical methods 
  favored by modernists?  Why must “rupture” be the privileged modality of contemporary 
  radical poetics?  Why must the post-structural skepticism of suturing prevail?  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>My thought here was less to question the “right” 
  or “wrong” of particular poetics but to consider how those poetics may stem 
  from specific historical experiences or endure synthetically as a stylistic 
  gesture to a “moment” when the ruptures of poetic forms seemed so “new,” so 
  “fresh” (a fresh wound).  Why must it be presumed that for a poem to be innovative 
  and express its historicity it must present rupture, breaks, and fragmentation?  
  To what extent are such modes now in the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century 
  simply repetitions, blank copies (Jamesonian pastiche?) of their necessity a 
  hundred years before?  And if so, to what extent does the dominance of paratactical 
  methods, montage, semantic breaks in contemporary poetry inadequately express 
  the particular lived historical experiences of violences perpetrated in the 
  contemporary geo-political sphere, in the era of “the Web” and the new deterritorialized 
  information economy?  Or in an age of multiple and ever-developing “low-intensity 
  conflicts” (military jargon from the 70s used to describe the future of conflict 
  in the “third world”), an age of “permanent war” (the U.S. has been in a constant 
  state of military war buildup since World War II), and an age in which “violence” 
  has become one of the primary spectacle commodities?  The cinematic montage 
  pioneered by Eisenstein as a revolt against ideology has now become the dominant 
  mode for the delivery of violent spectacles for media entertainment—from <i>Potemkin</i> 
  to MTV-X.  How to disrupt semantics under the Bush regime, when semantic incoherence 
  is normative of state discourse?  </p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>Break or Threshold?</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>In her paper, “Another Postmodernism: Towards an 
  Ethical Poetics,” Cynthia writes:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is not wrong to subordinate art to history’s horrors, 
  in [Alicia] Ostriker’s view; she argues, however, not to stop there. . . . The 
  site of . . . struggle—the witnessing, the transmuting (i.e. the representing), 
  the act of contemplative analysis (or vision, if you will) that becomes the 
  work of art—is a place where aesthetics and ethics can meet synergistically.(1)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Later in this excellent paper, she asserts that “[w]hat 
  [Marianne Moore and Alice Fulton] call for is a less visually, formally, and 
  thematically stabilized poetry—a poetry that is on the verge or at the edge. 
  . . . Fulton is interested in a poetry open to the fluctuations of <i>conscious</i>, 
  <i>mindfulness, openheartedness</i>.”  She’s interested in the point at which 
  “structure is incipient, all threshold, a neither-nor” (4).  Cynthia sees Fulton’s 
  work as expressing a concern with the “ethical aspect of the artistic practice,” 
  as “reconstructive (rather than revolutionary)” (8).  Rather than “rupture” 
  as incipient, structure, coherence.  This notion also reminded me of Kathleen’s 
  essay on a “local coherence” as a recuperative poetics.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Some of what Cynthia’s paper was suggesting about 
  the notion of a coherence that is also on the edge was corroborated for me by 
  a conversation I had with Kathleen in Houston about “edges”—that while they 
  may be viewed as breaks, gashes, wounds, as traces of violence, it is important 
  to consider what’s at the edge, who speaks from the edge, the margin, how the 
  edge might be a threshold, a potentiality, a verge.  As Kathleen asked in her 
  essay, “Partial local coherence”:</p>
<p>To what extent has [women’s] experience been suppressed or examined exclusively 
  through the finely polished lens of male writing sensibility?  What qualities 
  of perception, what moments of importance may have been devalued consistently 
  by the <i>absence</i> of a significant body of writing by women that might have 
  reinforced a reality that did not find validation in the bulk of literature 
  brought forward in textbook choices--the literary canon. (76; emphasis original)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Couldn’t it be said, for example, that the incipiently 
  violent rhetoric used to describe avant-garde poetry stems from a male-dominated 
  hypostasization and objectification of edges and gaps as scary, violent, threatening 
  “breaks” and “ruptures”?  Couldn’t it also be the case that perhaps from the 
  perspectives of many women poets, edges and gaps may be more productively seen 
  as potentialities, as openings, as apertures into and through which new meanings, 
  syntax issue?  The former reifies an act of violence—the latter rearticulates 
  an experience of creation and suturing.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Of course, this all rehearses a rather old feminist 
  critique of the phallogocentric discourse of “whole/part” in which the whole 
  (Phallus) is valorized over and against the partial.  Yet what I’m also understanding 
  in Cynthia’s paper and in much of Kathleen’s and Carla’s works is a relation 
  to poetic innovation that does not, like Pound, Eliot, et al., seek a reification 
  of violence hypostatized as paratactical fragmentation. Carla’s work, for example, 
  seems to me to be about rethinking narrative, about reimagining the possibilities 
  for suturing.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>In a 1996 interview, Carla said,</p>
<p>I’m trying to find out if there is a sort of nonrigid utopian imagination. 
  . . . if it’s possible to do this in a way that admits and addresses and doesn’t 
  simply alter but actually takes on as a material reality, in some way or other, 
  dystopian conditions. . . . Much utopian thought in literature . . . is basically 
  reactive and reactionary. . . . [I]t has to do with the individual’s critique 
  of the present world.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>[From Carla’s e-mail to the panelists on 9/22: “What 
  I thought on September 10 is not obsolete today.”]</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>One of the topics that came up in exchanges between 
  Elisabeth and me on this panel back in the summer was the return to narrative 
  in experimental poetics.  I was intrigued by this after 9-11, especially given 
  the overwhelming hype lyric poetry seemed to have gotten after that event, the 
  unexamined turn to poetry in a time of crisis—not that such a turn isn’t promising, 
  but that it all too often relied on the reaffirmation of comfortable and normalizing 
  responses to the moment.  Poetry now seemed for many in the wake of 9-11 to 
  play the role not of a “making strange,” but of a means for reaffirming ideological 
  norms (the repetition of Auden’s “September 1,” especially).  But it’s just 
  as true that narrative plays important roles in a society experiencing crisis.  
  Is it possible to recuperate narrative as a viable resource for a new poetics 
  which would resist and/or “make strange,” which could act critically against 
  the cultural logics of war?  </p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>Excursus</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>— What does “innovation” mean in a time of historical 
  mass violence and state-sponsored repression?</p>
<p>Innovation: introduction of novelties; alteration of what is established</p>
<p>— Revolution (=L. <i>novæ res</i>) <u>Obs.</u>; a political revolution</p>
<p>— the alteration of an obligation; substitution of new obligation for old (<u>Law</u>)</p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'>—  The formation of a new shoot—new life, growth,

<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>The example of early 20<sup>th</sup> century African 
  American sonnets</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Critics/academics tend to identify “innovative” poetics 
  in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century as work which makes strong textual, formal, 
  and linguistic breaks from 19<sup>th</sup> century poetry, especially Victorian 
  verse in conventional form characterized by sentimentalism.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>This view of poetics necessarily depends on presuming 
  the hegemonic character of a certain style of 19<sup>th</sup> century poetry 
  against which the early 20<sup>th</sup> century poets could revolt.  By taking 
  for granted the canonical view of literary history, this view runs the risk 
  of reinforcing and affirming that canon.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>But the conventionality of a verse style can only 
  be judged as such by those readers to whom it is already overly familiar, for 
  whom it has become cliché.  What of a community of readers who had had comparatively 
  little exposure to such verse, who might be approaching, say the sonnet, for 
  historically the first time in any systematic fashion, for whom, let’s say, 
  an education in the very verse forms Pound, Eliot, and others railed against 
  had just lately become available?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>During the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, one of 
  the most popular poetic forms among African American poets was the sonnet.  
  While it’s true that, as Lorenzo points out, some black poets (Fenton Johnson, 
  Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer) were developing new ways to bring black vernacular 
  culture into the lyric, the vast majority of publishing black poets favored 
  conventional, “genteel” forms written in high poetic diction and standard English.  
  Do we accept the agonistic, even crypto-Darwinian argument (they were the strong 
  exceptions that introduced the evolutionary progressive innovations) that Johnson, 
  Hughes, and Toomer were the most innovative, and therefore the modernism of 
  early 20<sup>th</sup> century black poetry can best be defined by their experiments?  
  Or do we need to rethink what “innovative” means for black writers in this period?  
  By the dawn of the Harlem Renaissance, for the first time in U.S. history, a 
  significant segment of the African American population had received college 
  degrees from liberal arts schools.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>What was the appeal in an age of “red summers” and 
  KKK-violence and in the shadow of Reconstruction’s failures for black writers 
  of the sonnet, this most orderly, classical form of poetry?</p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'>From the Lukacs/Brecht debates, to Adorno, to Deleuze-Guattari 
  and postmodernism the impulse to suture, to cohere has been viewed as logically 
  related to normalization, stablization, an acquiescence to power, to hegemony.    
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>There was a debate on Poetics-L during the early 
  days after 9-11 over the waving of the flag—some denounced it as empty jingoism, 
  others wanted to recuperate some vestige of authenticity in this gesture—there 
  was a lot of discussion about the flag as “transitional object”—Winnicott’s 
  theory that traumatized people often cling to a particular object of symbolic 
  significance to help them psychically endure and survive in desperate times.</p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'>How does the lyric “hold up” in a time of historical 
  violence? </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Eavan Boland asked this question in a dialogue she 
  had with Kathleen published in <i>Parnassus</i> May 1998.  From Boland’s perspective, 
  from the experience of Belfast and the constant state of emergency borne of 
  sectarian strife and British military occupation, this question reverberates 
  tangibly in ways that perhaps the more theoretical musings I’ve been doing necessarily 
  cannot.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>But for many days after 9-11 as I prepared to go 
  to Houston and the MSA conference, this question kept coming back to mind.  
  What struck me about it was the idea&nbsp;of poem as “holding up”—something 
  so evanescent, ephemeral, and fragile as the&nbsp;lyric as not just having a 
  discursive structure that may or may not hold <i>up</i>, but as an edifice [f. 
  <i>ædis</i> temple, house + <i>-ficium</i> making]—the lyric as spiritual dwelling 
  or gathering place, the made shelter of the holy.  I was also thinking about 
  the implicit need expressed in that&nbsp;phrase, that notion of a lyric “holding 
  up,” for the security of lyric in a time of historical crisis, for&nbsp;it to 
  “stand” and to shelter, to maintain, persist, to not crumble, fall—the&nbsp;solace 
  of the lyric in a time of ruptures—the lyric as dwelling and shelter—</p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>Social network analysis</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>On my way to Harrisburg International Airport to 
  catch my flight to Houston on October 12, the traffic along Rt. 581 was backed 
  up for miles—a car had caught fire up ahead (an emergency).  Sitting in traffic, 
  I heard an NPR report on the increased interest after 9-11 among anti-terror 
  professionals in the use of “Social Network Analysis,” a largely academic field 
  which combines sociology, statistics, math, and computer science to analyze 
  behavior patterns in social groups.  On the program, an expert in this field 
  said that Social Network Analysis focuses on “Isolates”: individuals who tend 
  to act apart from the social group—they tend to be “different” and often act 
  alone and against the social group.  It is believed that by identifying isolates 
  in terrorist groups, the U.S. could find potential informants and, thus, disrupt 
  a terrorist cell.  Along with isolates, network analysis also tries to identify 
  individuals with “centrality”—those who are well-connected and yet are not the 
  main power of the group.  These individuals may likely have the ability to spread 
  disinformation within the group that need not be scrutinized closely, since 
  such individuals are so well-connected.  Another element of concern was “betweenness,” 
  a characteristic of certain individuals within a group who move easily between 
  others and, thus, may act as a conduit or circuit in the social system.  The 
  applicability of Social Network Analysis for anti-terrorist work seems to be 
  its ability to chart connections within social groups through “pattern recognition” 
  and exploit those connections so as to disrupt the group from within.  By exploiting 
  the outsiderhood of an isolate, for example, law enforcement might be able to 
  coerce this individual to betray the group.  By exploiting the connectedness 
  of persons with traits of “betweennenss” the state could circulate disinformation 
  within the group to undermine it.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Besides the eerieness of the jargon used in Social 
  Network Analysis and its “big brother” potential and the uncanny chill it gave 
  me listening about it on my car radio as I sat in a traffic jam, a car on fire 
  up ahead, my flight due to leave in an hour, on Oct. 12, just a month and a 
  day after the attacks, it also occurred to me how this news might relate to 
  my conundrums about modernist and contemporary poetics, about the possibilities 
  for narrativity and paratactic/syntactic disruptiveness.  In some ways this 
  story reveals how such analytical and discursive modes can be seen as inscribed 
  into the workings of power.  “Disruption” is the goal of the new narrativity 
  of Social Networks Analysis—this field that monitors groups for patterns, that 
  searches out connections, sutures—which are also always already points of fissure, 
  potential gaps, potential breaks or ruptures in the system to be exploited and 
  torn open—bears out much of the post-structural analysis of hegemonic formation 
  (see Laclau and Mouffe).  Patterns are always about connections while at the 
  same time they are always an arrangement of ruptures, however elided or well-concealed.  
  No system is monolithic, seamless, without fissures.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>The outsiderhood so often mythologized in literary 
  cultures is itself the potential partner of power—the very asocial character 
  of the isolate makes the individual more susceptible to carrying out the behests 
  of power—although undermining the isolate’s immediate group, this individual 
  serves the needs of another group.</p>

<p style='line-height:200%;'><i>. . . down by the riverside . . .</i></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>Ultimately, I have been concerned since 9-11, and 
  the online and in-person conversations with my MSA co-panelists’ with trying 
  to think about the possibilities for poetry in this moment of geo-political 
  and micrological violences, in this time of massive military excess (how many 
  tons of munitions dropped on Afghanistan?) that is also a time of the Deleuze-Guattari 
  “nomadic” terror, when the body politic has been “infected” from within by secret 
  agents traversing the molar state at will, waiting to release toxins into the 
  system and unleash indiscriminate forms of death—while at the same time, “my” 
  country drops bombs indiscriminately on the already bombed into the stone age 
  people of Afghanistan—“eternal justice”—the total war state.  How to think of 
  an innovative poetics that is not a violence?  I don’t want to study war no 
  more.</p>
