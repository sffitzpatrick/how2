<p style='line-height:200%'><b>Transnational Gendered Modernisms:  Reading Manifestoes, 
  Political Poetry, and</b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b>Orature by Black South African Women </b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b>Mary K. DeShazer</b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>What happens when feminist scholars transnationalize 
  the boundaries of gendered modernisms?  When we read “on the move,” developing 
  a diasporic consciousness that allows us to explore the historical and cultural 
  exigencies of once colonized people who have documented their experiences in 
  literary or polemical texts?  How might we reread gendered modernities through 
  diasporic women’s testimonies of a perpetual state of living in the borderlands; 
  their accounts of racist violence, homelessness, or forced dislocation and the 
  attendant memories and traumas; their resultant multivocal identity politics 
  and poetics of resistance?  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Black South African women’s anti-apartheid manifestoes, 
  political poetry, and orature from the first half of the twentieth century suggest 
  new ways of examining these questions.  In bringing a postcolonial, diasporic 
  lens to modernist narratives from the South African national liberation struggle, 
  I wish to extend the insights of Paul Gilroy on the Black Atlantic and the “chronotope” 
  of ships passing from Europe to Africa and back; of Rita Felski on feminist 
  discourses of racial othering in early suffragist texts; and of Janet Lyon on 
  the significance and mutual influence of British and U.S. political manifestoes 
  of the modernist period.  Such revisionist transnational inquiry can contribute 
  to what Gilroy has called a “politics of transfiguration” that “reveals the 
  hidden internal fissures in the concept of modernity” (38). It also responds 
  to the question of what critical ground gendered modernisms need still to cover.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Reading as modernist texts the manifestoes against 
  racism (and sexism) by Black South African women of the African National Congress 
  (ANC) enables us to extend our understanding of feminist discourses of evolution 
  and revolution beyond the boundaries investigated so insightfully by Felski 
  and Lyon.  To challenge the “ideology of primitivism” in Olive Schreiner’s <i>Women’s 
  Labour</i> (1911), in which, as Felski notes, Schreiner claims that Black (“Kaffir”) 
  women accept their lot as submissive to men while  European women protest it, 
  we might explore speeches by Charlotte Maxeke, a South African teacher who joined 
  the “Women’s Auxiliary” of the ANC when it was founded in 1912 as a “national 
  vigilant organization” to assert the rights of South Africa’s majority Black 
  population.  Dissatisfied, like many women leaders, with non-voting status in 
  the ANC, Maxeke founded the Bantu Women’s League in 1918. She was inspired by 
  the militancy of 600 women in Bloemfontain, who in 1913 had successfully demonstrated 
  against the white government’s efforts to require them to carry passbooks, or 
  “passes,” that identified them as racial others and limited severely their freedom 
  of movement.  These African women identified with British suffragism, as indicated 
  by the cry of “Votes for Women” that emerged during the demonstrations at Bloemfontain 
  and by their wearing of the blue rosettes which suffragists also favored  (Wells, 
  21-29).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Comparing the writing of Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst 
  about “Black Friday,” a day in December 1913 when militant British suffragists 
  sustained their most violent treatment at the hands of the police, to the manifestoes 
  of South African women in the 1913 anti-pass protests reveals how feminist discourse 
  across cultures can offer a richly integrative field of study.  The anti-pass 
  activists, like Schreiner and the Pankhursts, rely on the rhetorical strategies 
  of repetition, abstraction, hyperbole, and prophecy in their speeches and treatises. 
  Typically they speak as a unitary “we,” reveal a teleology that posits good 
  vs. evil, and offer a spirited ethical critique of their oppressors (“men” for 
  the suffragists, “white men” for the South African women).  These South African 
  documents present Black women activists, in Felski’s words, as “subjects of 
  social processes rather than mere bystanders” (168).  As she notes in <i>Doing 
  Time</i>, reconceptualizing modernity does not erase differences but undoes 
  and redoes them in complex ways (62).  Other documents by Black anti-apartheid 
  women activists bear scrutiny as well, most notably the resolution on women’s 
  resistance drafted by female ANC delegates to the All African Convention of 
  1935; the new ANC constitution of 1943, drafted by men and women together, which 
  gave women full voting rights within the organization; and the 1955 Freedom 
  Charter and its attendant list of demands, drafted by the newly formed Federation 
  of South African Women (see Kimble and Unterhalter, 1-10).  Also worth examining 
  is the rhetoric of the second women’s anti-pass march of 1956, when 20,000 women 
  stormed the government halls in Pretoria, chanting the now-famous slogan,</p>
<p>You have tampered with the women;</p>
<p>You have struck a rock.</p>
<p>You have dislodged a boulder;</p>
<p>You will be crushed (DeShazer, 133).</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>            </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Although few Black South African women published poetry 
  during the modernist period, and virtually none in English, poets since the 
  1960s have written imaginatively from the perspective of their mothers and grandmothers.  
  An especially salient motif has been the plight and protests of domestic workers, 
  arguably the most exploited of South Africa’s female laborers (Thula Baba, 324).  
  Looking intertextually at domestic worker poetry by African American women of 
  the Harlem Renaissance and poetry by South African women that documents the 
  1940s and 50s can yield fruitful insights into what Rachel DuPlessis terms “social 
  philology,” a method of close reading that attends to “the events of the form” 
  and the ideological assumptions and cultural narratives that undergird them 
  (5). </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'> For example, we might compare the language and imagery 
  of Anne Spencer’s tribute to a Black American washerwoman, “Lady, Lady” (1925), 
  to those of Boitumelo Mofokeng’s “Inside a Domestic Worker” (1950).  Addressing 
  the domestic worker with empathy, Spencer uses the woman’s hands as a synecdoche 
  for her exploited labor:</p>
<p>            Lady, Lady, I saw your hands,</p>
<p>            Twisted, awry, like crumpled roots,</p>
<p>            Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub,</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'>            Wrinkled and 
  drawn from your rub-a-dub.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Ironically, the Lady’s hands emerge “poor white” from 
  the washtub, as bleached and “twisted” as the minds of her oppressors.  Mofokeng 
  also employs hand imagery in her poem; however, she speaks not to a domestic 
  worker but in her voice, and she portrays the worker’s hands as a tool of salvation:</p>
<p>                        If I don’t know arithmetic</p>
<p>                        My hands will save me.</p>
<p>                        I can work in the kitchens.</p>
<p>                        My back can be a rocking horse</p>
<p>                        For kleinbassie. (the boss’s son)</p>
<p>                        Restig, Missus soek vir hardwerkers. (Be assured, the 
  Missus is </p>
<p>                                                                        determined 
  to find hard workers). </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Using Afrikaans, the official language of apartheid, 
  Mofokeng’s domestic worker both acknowledges and resists her status as beast 
  of burden.  Although she recognizes the indignity of her body as a toy that 
  the master’s young son can manipulate, she confronts the “Missus” on her own 
  terms and in the oppressor’s language.  By validating the domestic worker’s 
  subjectivity, both Spencer and Mofokeng contribute to the feminist project of 
  breaking silence about Black women’s exploitation.  However, through her use 
  of colloquial free verse rather than quatrains of iambic tetrameter, and through 
  her code-switching from English to Afrikaans, Mofokeng inscribes a subversive 
  text.  She presents her domestic worker not as a victim but as a survivor.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>            The poetic form most fully embraced by 
  rural Zulu women is that of <i>izibongo</i>, or praise poems.  Although <i>izibongo</i> 
  have for centuries been associated with war and male authority, and <i>izimbongi</i> 
  (bards) who recite on public occasions have generally been men, women too have 
  composed and performed praise poems in private circle ceremonies, as a means 
  of exploring issues of daily life, personal identity, and domestic conflict.  
  The scholar and oral historian Elizabeth Gunner, who collected and translated 
  women’s <i>izibongo</i> from KwaZulu/Natal during the 1960s and 70s, argues 
  that such poetry constitutes “an effective and socially acceptable way of publicly 
  announcing one’s anger or grief”(240).  Moreover, through their private nature 
  via “in-house only” performances (no men or female outsiders are allowed), and 
  through their use of an indigenous language, <i>izibongo</i> have resisted appropriation 
  by the forces of apartheid, which from 1948 to 1994 attempted, through forced 
  relocations and inferior educational opportunity, to rob South Africa’s Black 
  people of their cultural heritage and distinction.  Proponents of apartheid 
  devalued or ignored orature, just as they marginalized the people who create 
  it, yet orature has thrived for generations across African cultures and languages.  
  Praise poetry might thus be usefully compared to those poetic forms that Cheryl 
  Wall has called “the building blocks of African-American modernism”: folk speech, 
  spirituals, gospel, jazz, and blues (1).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Specifically, Zulu women’s praise poems can be read 
  alongside the blues songs of Bessie Smith, “Ma” Rainey, or Billie Holliday and 
  the “bad” ballads of Margaret Walker, known for their powerful blend of outrage 
  and lament, their sexual explicitness, and their representations of women’s 
  anger at male exploiters and female rivals. Take, for example, the praise poem 
  of Silomo of the Mdlalose clan, composed early in the twentieth century for 
  her daughter, Princess Magogo, and translated by Gunner.  Its primary stylistic 
  characteristics are indirection and private allusion, its major motif is confessional, 
  and its composition appears to be singular rather than collaborative.  ( <i>Izibongo</i> 
  often are composed collectively by members of the audience, but this poem is 
  attributed to one woman rather than a group of women from a certain tribe).  
  Initially addressing her daughter as “sensitive one,” Silomo vents her hostility 
  toward an unnamed other woman, probably a co-wife; reveals that woman’s aggression 
  toward Silomo, which motivates the speaker’s anger; and relies on explicit references 
  to female sexuality and embodiment:</p>
<p>                        Sensitive one, easily moved,</p>
<p>                        I wonder if the deceitful creature over there hears 
  my words?</p>
<p>                        The broad-lipped woman pursued unmercifully, the one 
  with labia like a</p>
<p>                                                puffed adder?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Lines 4-9 catalog a series of insults the speaker 
  has suffered at the hands of this broad-lipped woman, who “turned in disdain 
  from me.”  The reason for this scorn, and the reason for the poem, is probably 
  the birth of the speaker’s regal child:  “I have become the great mother of 
  the royal line.”  In the last five lines, addressing her competitor directly, 
  the speaker offers a humorous, dismissive invective:</p>
<p>                        And what could you say to me? You with a twig for offspring,</p>
<p>                        With your lop-sided head.</p>
<p>                        You’re like this and I will insult you like this:</p>
<p>                        You’re like the shrivelled-up buttocks of my brother-in-law;</p>
<p>                        You’re like the shrivelled-up buttocks of Zinyo (Gunner, 
  250).</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>This <i>izibongo</i> might be usefully compared to 
  Margaret Walker’s “Molly Means” as the type of poem that Countee Cullen, speaking 
  pejoratively of the jazz poetry of Langston Hughes, called an “interloper” (DuPlessis, 
  108).  Walker’s speaker, like Silomo, plays the dozens, insulting Molly as a 
  “witch,” “hag,” and “chile of the devil”; she too portrays her adversary in 
  derogatory, sexualized terms—“barking like a dog/And on all fours like a common 
  hog”. Gendered remappings and rich textual hybridities emerge through such migratory 
  readings.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>In 1984 Adrienne Rich challenged U.S. feminists to 
  consider Black South African women’s discourses of resistance as crucial texts 
  for global feminist theory: </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>When I learn that in 1913, mass women’s marches were 
  held in South Africa which caused the rescinding of entry permit laws; that… 
  African women have played a major role alongside men in resisting apartheid, 
  I have to ask myself why it took me so long to learn these chapters of women’s 
  history, why the leadership and strategies of African women have been so unrecognized 
  as theory in action by white Western feminist thought (231).</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Why indeed?  I join Rich in urging that further critical 
  attention be given to these exemplary South African texts and contexts.  Yet 
  in doing so I wish not to privilege the discourses of one nation’s women over 
  those produced by other postcolonial and gender-focused writers and activists.  
  A vital concern that events following September 11 have reawakened for Western 
  academic women, it seems to me, is how best to support dialogue across cultural 
  differences and thus foster solidarity among women seeking self-determination.  
  As U.S. playwright and activist Eve Ensler noted at the Dec. 2001 Brussels Conference 
  on Women in Afghanistan, to women struggling against misogyny and for survival 
  and empowerment, “Afghanistan is Everywhere” (Austin, 14).  So, I would argue, 
  is South Africa.  From Charlotte Maxeke and the women of the ANC to domestic 
  worker poets like Boitumelo Mofokeng and Zulu praise poets like Silomo, South 
  African women have created political art that matters and transformed political 
  matters into art.   If we want to transnationalize gendered modernisms, feminist 
  scholars must hear their voices. </p>
