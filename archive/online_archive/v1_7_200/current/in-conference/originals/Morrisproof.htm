<p>Offends the September night.  (57)</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>When the twin towers collapsed again and yet again on television 
  screens across the globe, New York took its place in the westward push of T. 
  S. Eliot’s <i>Waste Land</i> catalogue: “Falling towers,” Eliot wrote, “Jerusalem 
  Athens Alexandria / Vienna London / Unreal.”  Among the multitude of poems sent 
  across listservs, printed in newspapers, and recited at memorials, “September 
  1, 1939,” “The Waste Land,” and H.D.’s <i>Trilogy </i>slid into position as 
  prophecy, prayer, and consolation.  The rhythms, words, and ritual space of 
  these poems provide focus and a semblance of solace for those who invoke them.  
  To aid and abet acceptance of loss, provide words to speak into silence, and 
  reconstitute a sense of shared history and values is key cultural work. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>It is the contention of 
  this paper, however, that poetry has another role to fill in a time of atrocity.  
  Against the short-term intimacies of consolation, I want to invoke a long-term, 
  large-scale, propositional poetics: a poetics of difficulty which at its best 
  participates in the creation of a politics of difficulty.  As I hope to show 
  through a consideration of Ezra Pound and Leslie Scalapino, although such a 
  poetics is not always—or only—progressive, its methods are crucial in times 
  of atrocity.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>In so far as Scalapino is 
  an innovative rather than a lyrical or meditative poet, she occupies a place 
  in the lineage of Pound, but these two poets make a very odd couple: Pound’s 
  rants, his flights of egoism, and his flirtation with Fascism clash with Scalapino’s 
  attenuations, the koan-like elusiveness of her writing, and her corrosive contempt 
  for bullies and tyrants.  There are, however, similarities that align the propositional 
  poetics of these two writers as a thinking toward action or, perhaps better, 
  a thinking <i>as</i> action.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>Both Pound and Scalapino 
  are poets of impassioned regard for and address to the public world.  They write 
  within a global network of histories, governments, economies, and texts.  They 
  mess with newspapers, talk like comic books, and, if they could, would publish 
  their work, as Scalapino puts it, “on billboards or outdoors as murals” (<i>Front 
  Matter</i> 1).  While they write in public and to the public, however, they 
  write against conventional public thought.  Their default mode is oppositional, 
  assuming the worst of a greedy, hate-filled, and delusional populace prepared 
  to follow craven leaders into disastrous wars.  Their enormous impatience with 
  institutionalized fraud and stupidity feeds a creativity that takes its shape 
  as an alternate form of intelligence.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>The first stanza of Auden’s poem, 
  although clipped, goes with, rather than against, the grain of public thought.  
  Comfortingly mimetic and hypotactic, its elements bind real-world referents 
  into recognizable patterns of reasoning.  When Auden tells us he sits “in one 
  of the dives / on Fifty-second Street,” we place him in a midtown Manhattan 
  bar; when he says he sits there <i>as</i> “clever hopes expire,” we know these 
  hopes come to an end both <i>at the moment that</i> and <i>because</i> “[w]aves 
  of anger and fear” escalate into war.  In Auden’s stanza, the all but invisible 
  <i>as </i>anchors the reader firmly in a cause-and-effect world of dependent 
  and subordinate syntactical relationships.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>As poets, Pound and Scalapino 
  think—and, when they are successful, induce their readers to think—paratactically.  
  Propositions in their poems swing free, that is, both conceptually and syntactically.  
  Pound begins Canto 3, in the same manner as Auden begins “September 1, 1939”—“I 
  sat on the Dogana’s steps,” he writes, “<i>For</i> the gondolas cost too much, 
  that year”—but two lines is as far as he can go in a hypotactic vein.  The rest 
  of the canto, like the larger matrix into which it fits, is articulated by the 
  <i>and</i>’s and <i>or</i>’s of parataxis: the lit cross-beams in the palace 
  <i>and</i> the peacocks in Koré’s house <i>and</i> bright gods in the azure 
  air <i>or</i> gray steps under the cedars; El Cid on the run <i>and</i> Ignez 
  da Castro murdered <i>and</i> plaster flaking from a wall once painted by Mantegna.  
  This is the method Scalapino identifies in Philip Whalen’s writing as “all layers 
  at the same time” (“Radical Nature” 4).  I will call it, for the moment, the 
  <i>and-effect</i>.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>The most efficient way to read Canto 
  3 is to articulate its components by moving deliberately—with deliberation—from 
  things to concepts.  This is the opposite of conventional thought, which tends, 
  like the canto’s opening lines, to hinge on pre-given cause-and-effect relationships: 
  I sat on the steps, Pound says, <i>because</i> I didn’t have money to take a 
  gondola.  Not interesting.  The rest of the canto, however, applies a lesson 
  Pound learned from Fenollosa’s <i>Chinese Written Character as a Medium for 
  Poetry.</i>  Confronted with the ideograms for “flamingo” <i>and</i> “cherry” 
  <i>and</i> “iron-rust” <i>and</i> “sunset,” Fenollosa tells us, an active reader, 
  at first baffled, will bust through sooner or later into the idea of <i>red</i>.  
  Confronted with Canto 3’s scenes of exile <i>and</i> banishment <i>and</i> neglect 
  <i>and</i> public indifference to art, a reader will come to the idea of <i>cultural 
  corruption</i>.  Epistemology is the action of the poem.  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>The purpose of the <i>and-effect</i>, 
  then, is to build conceptual categories from the ground up, thus dissolving 
  what Fenollosa called “the discredited, or rather the useless, logic of the 
  Middle Ages” (CWC 12) and allowing a reader to—in Harryette Mullen’s phrase—“think 
  toward action” (Bedient 661).  One should open the gates of Burgos to El Cid; 
  one should maintain Mantegna’s frescos; one should make sure poets have the 
  means to navigate the canals of the city of lights.  The result of thinking 
  upward through the <i>and-effect</i> is the dissolution of public clichés—that 
  art is a luxury, for example, or that men of forceful will are dangerous to 
  the well-being of the state.  This kind of category-busting, for Fenollosa and 
  Pound, promotes change from within by bringing forces previously held apart 
  into interaction and multiplying their cultural functions (<i>Chinese Written 
  Character</i> 27).</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>As a number of commentators have 
  pointed out, however, the <i>and-effect</i> of <i>The Cantos</i> is a squeeze 
  play, a trap.  A reader is free to make recategorizations, yes, but only those 
  determined in advance, those any idiot could see, Pound says, if she looks, 
  really looks.  Like his hero Louis Agassiz, who reasoned from “fact” upward 
  to the conclusion that “[s]exual intercourse between whites and blacks . . . 
  was the moral and biological equivalent of incest” (Menand 114), Pound’s recategorizations 
  include ideas Charles Bernstein has characterized as “totalitarianism masking 
  as authority, racism posing as knowledge, and elitism claiming the prerogatives 
  of culture” (<i>A Poetics</i> 121).  For Pound, these conclusions are as natural, 
  objective, and scientific as “redness,” as monovalent and closed as “rightness.”  
  If we credit Pound’s fulminations against readers who do not use his method 
  to reach his madness, the paratactic thought-path of <i>The Cantos</i> is no 
  less constrained than the hypotactic meditations of “September 1, 1939.”  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>It is tempting to argue that the 
  apparent freedom of Pound’s method is invalidated by the poverty of his ideals, 
  but in the end the method of <i>The Cantos</i> is more powerful and enduring 
  than its application.  As Franco Moretti has emphasized in a similar context, 
  literary evolution, like Marxism, necessitates internal discontinuities, uneven 
  developments.  To the extent that Pound’s method cuts against conventional mentation 
  by requiring a reader to think otherwise, the <i>and-effect</i> is an advance.  
  “Progress coexists with backwardness, indeed depends on it,” Moretti writes.  
  “One level of the work can be bold, <i>because</i> the other is crude and superfluous.  
  It is a constructional split that runs through almost the entire twentieth century” 
  (119). </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>Pound’s source-text, <i>The Chinese 
  Written Character as a Medium for Poetry,</i> is, like <i>The Cantos</i>, an 
  epistemological treatise.  By investigating alternative ways of knowing, Fenollosa’s 
  aim was to teach Westerners to outsmart the conventions of their own logic.  
  In Fenollosa’s elaborate explanatory metaphor, Western thought consists of word-bricks—“little 
  hard units or concepts”—piled in rows according to function then stuck together 
  into “a sort of wall called a sentence by the use either of white mortar for 
  the positive copula ‘is,’ or of black mortar for the negative copula ‘is not.’  
  In this way,” Fenellosa concludes, “we produce such admirable propositions as 
  ‘A ring-tailed baboon is not a constitutional assembly” (26).  Putting aside 
  for a moment the lovely irony that for Pound and Scalapino assemblies of any 
  sort consist exactly of ring-tailed baboons, I want to segue from Pound’s <i>and-effect</i> 
  to Scalapino’s <i>as-effect</i> through one of Fenollosa’s examples of an ideogrammic 
  way of knowing.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>To illustrate his claim that “[i]n 
  reading Chinese we do not seem to be juggling mental counters, but to be watching 
  <i>things</i> work out their own fate” (9), Fenollosa gives the example of the 
  ideogram for <i>ripple, </i>which is a superimposition of the characters for 
  <i>boat</i> and <i>water</i>:  Noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and preposition, 
  “boat-water” is at once a thing, an event, and a relation: a confluence, an 
  ongoingness, a transference of power, a destabilization which undulates outward 
  in all directions.  This ideogram is not an <i>and-effect</i>—boat <i>and</i> 
  water—because the concept <i>ripple</i> does not hold <i>boat</i> and <i>water</i> 
  apart but rather fuses—or confuses—them.  Boat, water, and ripple come into 
  existence together: each component generates and sustains the idea of the others.  
  Boat-water is a gradual diffusion—a ripple—which outraces identity or sameness.  
  In this ideogram, “[t]he difference,” as Gertrude Stein famously put it, “is 
  spreading” (9).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>Leslie Scalapino’s play 
  “As:  All Occurrence in Structure Unseen—(Deer Night)” is a rewriting of <i>The 
  Tempest</i> without Shakespeare’s plot, characters, language, or setting.  Composed 
  during a trip to Thailand and Bhutan, it is an integral part of a collection 
  of prose and poetry to which Scalapino has given the title <i>The Public World 
  / Syntactically Impermanence</i>.  Like <i>The Cantos</i>, this book is history 
  and dream, narrative, mythology, and literary criticism, polemic and investigation, 
  but I will consider it here primarily as epistemology and syntactics.  “Poetry 
  in this time and nation,” Scalapino says in “The Cannon,” one of the book’s 
  opening essays, “is doing the work of philosophy—it is writing that is conjecture” 
  (19).  Unlike Auden’s hypotaxis and Pound’s parataxis, Scalapino’s syntaxis—if 
  I can call it that—is predicated on enduring uncertainties.  Conjecture—the 
  throwing together that is “syntactically impermanence”—is, by definition, the 
  attempt to reach a conclusion or judgment on the basis of uncertain evidence.  
  As Lyn Hejinian argues in a parallel statement about her own poem “Happily,” 
  “it is <i>as</i> philosophy--<i>as</i> the making and seeing of connections 
  . . . —that poetry participates in knowing what we can and can’t know about 
  the world and how to live in it” (384; my italics).</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>When I say I want to consider 
  Scalapino’s book “as philosophy,” I mean <i>in the guise of</i> philosophy, 
  but I also mean, more precisely, as “<i>as</i>-philosophy.”  The most ambitious 
  segment of <i>The Public World / Syntactically Impermanence</i> is the play-cycle 
  <i>As</i>, which develops through an impermanence syntax—a hypothetical rolling 
  syntax—which Hejinian terms the “as-effect.”  Hejinian explains this effect 
  through an extended analogy with the instrumental case in Russian grammar, which 
  allows one to say not just “she sings like a nightingale” but “she sings <b>as</b> 
  a nightingale—in singing, she becomes a nightingale,” or, in another example, 
  not just “one walks along the shore,” but “in walking along the shore one is 
  that shore.”  “What I am calling the as effect,” Hejinian concludes, “is not 
  a trope but an ‘occurrence structure’” (5).  It is not additive—I <i>and</i> 
  the nightingale or I <i>and</i> the shore—but mutually transformative: I <i>as</i> 
  the shore, the shore <i>as</i> I.  The as-effect is, in short, an event-in-time 
  between two states: an energy transfer, a thought-ripple.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>            </span>The subtitle of the play—“All 
  Occurrence in Structure, Unseen (Deer Night)”—names what remains when one abandons 
  the plot, characters, setting, and language of Shakespeare’s <i>Tempest</i> 
  without abandoning an intent to comment on it / demonstrate against it.  As 
  a relationship hinged on <i>as</i>, the play (of) <i>As</i> is a manner of knowing: 
  <i>as if</i>, the play enumerates, <i>at the same time as,</i> <i>as allowing 
  difference</i> (97), <i>as it happens</i> (116), <i>as such</i> (117).  All 
  of these states of experience depend on free movement among events and ideas; 
  all acknowledge uncertainty and contingency; all erode the borders between things 
  and beings.  <i>As</i>—in short—disables the hierarchy, rigidity, and covetousness 
  which, for Scalapino as for many postcolonial scholars, makes Shakespeare’s<i> 
  Tempest</i> a marker text of imperialism and colonialism.  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>Like Pound’s <i>and-effect</i>, 
  Scalapino’s <i>as-effect</i> requires nimble cognition.  “I was interested,” 
  Scalapino writes, “in a syntax whose very mode of observation was to reveal 
  its structure; that is, its subject and its mode are subjectivity being observation” 
  (“Cannon” 26).  The reader of <i>As</i> must not only think but also—and at 
  the same time—think about how she is thinking.  This doubleness has the split 
  of the <i>and-effect</i>—one must consider, at the same moment, multinational 
  corporations, migrants crossing a desert, workers burning tar at dawn, and a 
  girl of fourteen sold into slavery in a brothel—and the twist or gyration of 
  the <i>as-effect</i>.  The exterior subject of the girl in the brothel, for 
  example, spins inward as an interior effect in the memory of a fourteen-year 
  old girl returning from Asia to the U.S.  “The syntax itself,” Scalapino explains, 
  “reorients one’s apprehension (by continual dis-location) and enables that which 
  is exterior to be included in a process of its examination, necessarily self-examination” 
  (“Cannon” 26).  In <i>As</i>, no one thing is central, solo, or still.  Moving 
  against fascism and fundamentalism, <i>As</i> generates a system of multiple 
  truths, lightly held, syntactically impermanence.  Its concepts are at once 
  deconstructive and pragmatic. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span>            </span>Pound and Scalapino ask a lot—some 
  might say too much—of their readers.  As we have seen so starkly in this last 
  month, however, an atrocity like the destruction of the twin towers both emerges 
  from and eventuates in a thinking that asks too little of its cognizers.  In 
  the politics of simplicity, fundamentalism begets oppositional fundamentalism; 
  crusades, crusades.  The discourse is no more complicated than the swapping 
  of pronouns in the interchange “I’m good, you’re evil” / “No, no, <i>I’m</i> 
  good, <i>you’re</i> evil.”  The gap created by <i>and</i> and the twist created 
  by <i>as</i> trouble the categorizations of the public world.  In a time of 
  uneven developments, mutual complicity, and contingent suffering, a poetics 
  of difficulty opens the thinking differently which also constitutes a politics 
  of difficulty.  “In the political sense,” as Harryette Mullen said in phrasing 
  that generated the topic in this panel, “we think of theory <i>as</i> not existing 
  for its own sake but <i>as</i> a way of thinking toward action <i>and</i> how 
  we actually exist in the world after we’ve thought about things.  Thinking should 
  change that” (Bedient 661).  </p>
