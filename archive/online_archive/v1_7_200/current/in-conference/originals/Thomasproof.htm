<p style='line-height:200%'>The original idea [for this panel] was modernist poetic 
  radicalism.  The question came to my mind whether that referred to poetic form 
  or to the consciousness that went into the poems.  In our subsequent conversations, 
  after September 11, the issue of just exactly what is the value of our precious 
  lessons came to my mind, and I insisted there must be some value to what we 
  teach and research.  So I went back to thinking about 1912—the launching of 
  Harriet Monroe’s <i>Poetry</i>, one of our landmarks for the birthdate of modernism—to 
  look at what the country’s intellectual atmosphere might have been at that moment.  
  This is before F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Jazz Age,” before Jean Toomer’s <i>Cane</i>, 
  which in 1923 heralded the dawning of the Harlem Renaissance.  In 1916, for 
  example, there weren’t any jazz records yet, and it would be a year before the 
  Texas folklorist John A. Lomax introduced readers of the <i>Nation</i> to a 
  form of music called blues, which he usefully described as “Negro songs of self&#8209;pity.”  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>So who or what did Americans think black people were?  
  In 1915, David Wark Griffith’s blockbuster movie “Birth of a Nation” hit the 
  public like a thunderbolt, and President Woodrow Wilson, who had a screening 
  of it in the White House (it was the first movie to be shown in the White House) 
  described it as “history written in lightning.”  The White House did not disclose 
  that Rev. Thomas Dixon, who was the author of <i>The Clansman</i>, a 1905 novel 
  that the movie was based on, happened to be Woodrow Wilson’s grad school chum.  
  But most people, black people, anyway, understood where the Wilson administration’s 
  racial ideas came from.  Not only did “The Birth of a Nation” make lots and 
  lots of money at the box office, it also revitalized the revived Atlanta&#8209;based 
  Ku Klux Klan.  In fact, at the movie’s premiere in Atlanta, while people stood 
  on line, Klansmen rode down the street on horseback handing out membership applications 
  to the moviegoers.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>But that was 1915.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>1917 proved that poetry could be hazardous to your 
  health, your bank account, and your mental stability.  In fact, a poem in 1917 
  could get you indicted, tried, and perhaps imprisoned.  And the Federal Government 
  in 1917 could prevent the distribution of magazines and newspapers in which 
  the offending poem appeared.  The Espionage Act passed in 1917, followed by 
  the Sedition Act passed in 1918, prepared the United States to enter as a combatant 
  in World War I.  Albert Burleson, the Postmaster General, was able to use the 
  Espionage Act and the Sedition Act to deny mailing privileges to any publication 
  that published material critical of the government's war effort.  That act was 
  invoked in 1917 to prevent distribution of the <i>Masses</i>, a radical, socialist 
  literary journal edited by Max Eastman.  His associates and contributors included 
  Floyd Dell, foreign correspondent John Reed, Mabel Dodge, and Dorothy Day.  
  Indicted with Eastman and six other editorial members for conspiring to obstruct 
  recruitment was the poet Josephine Bell.  Her crime was having written this 
  poem:</p>
<h1 style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A Tribute</span></i></h1>
<h1 style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman </span></h1>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Are in prison. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Although the night is tremblingly beautiful</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>And the sound of water climbs down the 
  rocks </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>And the breath of the night air moves 
  through multitudes and multitudes of leaves </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>That love to waste themselves for the 
  sake of the summer. </span></p>
<p>Emma  Goldman and Alexander Berkman </p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Are in prison tonight, </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>But they have made themselves elemental 
  forces, </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Like the water that climbs down the rocks:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Like the wind in the leaves:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Like the gentle night that holds us:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>They are working on our destinies:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>They are forging the love of the nations:</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Tonight they lie in prison.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Now, that poem was supposed to appear in the August 
  1917 issue of the <i>Masses</i>.  Postmaster General Burleson seized the issue 
  and refused to have it mailed.  Eastman and company were indicted and tried 
  for obstructing recruitment.  The judge dismissed charges against Josephine 
  Bell when he discovered that she really couldn’t be much of a conspirator, inasmuch 
  as like most of the rest of us, I suppose she had simply sent in her poem with 
  a stamped, self&#8209;addressed envelope, and Max Eastman and the rest decided 
  to print it.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>But the readers of the <i>Masses</i> knew Emma Goldman 
  as a trained nurse who campaigned vigorously for birth control.  In April 1916, 
  Goldman was arrested for giving a birth control lecture.  She decided, like 
  Marcus Garvey and other people that don’t have too much sense, to defend herself.  
  She was convicted, of course, and sentenced to 15 days in jail.  But the <i>Masses</i>, 
  in its June 1916 issue, published her courtroom speech.  Partly it said, “Your 
  Honor, if giving one’s life for the purpose of awakening race consciousness 
  in the masses, a consciousness that will impel them to bring quality and not 
  quantity into society, if that be a crime, I’m glad to be such a criminal.”  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>“After all,” she went on, “the question of birth control 
  is largely a working man’s question.  Above all, a working woman’s question.  
  She it is who risks her health, her youth, her very life, in giving out of herself 
  the units of the race.  She it is who ought to have the means and the knowledge 
  to say how many children she shall give, and to what purpose she shall give 
  them, and under what conditions she shall bring forth life.” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I suppose that that’s the Emma Goldman that Josephine 
  Bell was thinking of when she wrote the poem.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Alexander Berkman is a somewhat different story.  
  He was an anarchist who attempted to assassinate Carnegie Steel executive Henry 
  Clay Frick during the Homestead Strike.  He spent fourteen years in prison, 
  but he went on giving his political speeches once he got out.  The <i>cause 
  célèbre </i>of 1917 is that both Goldman and Berkman were arrested for obstructing 
  the draft.  And that has something to do with  the Post Office citing Josephine 
  Bell’s poem. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Of course, in 1919, both Berkman and Goldman were 
  eventually deported, along with 247 other undesirable aliens and anarchists.  
  But regarding the <i>Masses </i>trial, Margaret Jones—in <i>Heretics and Hell&#8209;Raisers: 
  Woman Contributors to</i> <i>The Masses—</i>points out:</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span> </span></p>
<p>The charge was a serious one.  The labor activist and <i>Masses</i> contributor</p>
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Rose Pastor Stokes was later to receive 
  a ten&#8209;year sentence under the </span></p>
<h4 style='line-height:normal'>Espionage Act for writing to a Kansas newspaper, 
  “I am for the people </h4>
<p>and the government is for the profiteers.”  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Another <i>Masses</i> contributor, graphic artist 
  Henry J. Glintencamp was indicted for a drawing depicting a skeleton measuring 
  a draftee for a uniform.  The post office saw it as an offense under the Espionage 
  Act—not as another homage to the traditional art motif of “Death-in-Life.”  
  But then maybe the readers didn’t see it that way, either.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Max Eastman and his associates had a lot of financial 
  backing.  And they went through two trials and won.  But, of course, the <i>Masses</i> 
  magazine went defunct in the interim, and he replaced it with a magazine called 
  <i>Liberator</i>.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Besides birth control and the draft, race was a particularly 
  sensitive issue to the government, partly because these years—before the Jazz 
  Age and the Harlem Renaissance and America’s involvement in World War I—provided 
  a great deal of material for those people who wanted to point out that democracy, 
  in some parts of this country anyway, was quite as unsafe as it was anyplace 
  else in the world.  In September 1916, the <i>Masses</i> ran an eyewitness report 
  on conditions in Waco, Texas, the day after a 17&#8209;year&#8209;old black 
  youth named Jesse Washington was dragged out of the courtroom where he was being 
  tried, and roasted over a bonfire in the courthouse square.  Photographs taken 
  from the vantage point of City Hall were later sold as postcards, souvenirs 
  of that incident.  The NAACP journal, the <i>Crisis</i>, devoted a whole issue—I 
  believe it was in September 1916—to that Waco atrocity. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Fenton Johnson’s Chicago magazine the <i>Champion</i> 
  pointedly compared Waco to the casualties incurred by a black cavalry unit on 
  duty in Mexico.  They were on a mission to arrest Pancho Villa, but they blundered 
  into the Mexican Civil War and were taken prisoners, resulting in President 
  Wilson calling up National Guardsmen and massing fifty thousand in Texas troops 
  at the border–threatening war with Mexico.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The African&#8209;American press, like the <i>Masses</i>, 
  was also subject to the intimidation of government readers, so to speak; and, 
  unlike the <i>Masses</i> and other wealthy liberals, did not have the resources 
  to fight against it.  During 1918, the Justice Department under Attorney General 
  A. Mitchell Palmer conducted extensive research and surveillance with a newly&#8209;established 
  task force.  And that group, headed by a young man named J. Edgar Hoover—on 
  his first job—explored and researched what Hoover called “radicalism and sedition 
  among Negroes as reflected in their publications.”  They published a wonderful 
  report in the documents of the 66th Congress, issued by the Government Printing 
  Office, which essentially is quite an interesting anthology of African&#8209;American 
  writing in 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1919.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Newspaper and magazine editors also might get a visit 
  from Maj. Walter Loving, who was a black Army officer.  He earned his commission 
  in the Spanish-American War.  There were very few black officers in the United 
  States Army then; none in the United States Navy.  But Walter Loving was attached 
  to the Military Intelligence Branch  (MIB) and worked in plainclothes, attending 
  political and intellectual meetings in Harlem, Chicago and elsewhere.  Of course 
  everyone knew who he was.  When he showed up to have an appointment with Robert 
  Abbott at the <i>Chicago Defender, </i>Mr. Abbott knew that the message was 
  that some of his editorials had annoyed someone in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Here in Houston, in September 1917, what is now Memorial 
  Park was called Camp Logan.  And the same 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> 
  Cavalry, and the 25th Infantry—the “Buffalo soldiers”—that had gotten in the 
  scrape in Mexico in 1916, were stationed here as security guards for the building 
  of Camp Logan. The facility was intended to be a training base for those soldiers 
  going to Europe—“over there” where the Yanks were coming.  After a month or 
  so of insults and racist abuse from the Houston Police Department and the public, 
  an incident took place on San Felipe Street.  The soldiers were outraged and 
  marched on the town from their base.  That’s described as the Houston Riot.  
  The upshot is several people were killed.  Most were black soldiers, also white 
  policemen and citizens who armed themselves to attack the soldiers or perhaps 
  to defend them.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Thirteen of the soldiers were court&#8209;martialed 
  and hanged.  Forty&#8209;one were court&#8209;martialed and given life imprisonment.  
  All of these trials went on within a bewilderingly short period of time, much 
  before the press knew anything about the incident.  When Archibald Grimké, who 
  was a well&#8209;known lawyer in Washington, D.C., wrote a poem called “Her 
  Thirteen Black Soldiers,” it was rejected by the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.  It 
  went from there to the <i>Crisis</i>, which was edited by W.E.B. Du Bois, and 
  according to Jervis Anderson in his biography of A. Philip Randolph, Du Bois 
  admitted to Archibald Grimké that—even though Grimké was head of the Washington 
  D.C. NAACP chapter—because of Justice Department scrutiny and the fact that 
  the Justice Department had found some of Du Bois’s <i>Crisis </i>editorials 
  disloyal, he dared not print this poem. A. Philip Randolph’s <i>Messenger</i> 
  did eventually print the poem “Her Thirteen Black Soldiers,” along with an editorial 
  note pointing out that both  the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and the <i>Crisis</i> 
  had not dared to print the poem. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>That editorial note was typical of Randolph’s style 
  at the time.  J. Edgar Hoover’s investigative report to Congress described the 
  <i>Messenger</i> magazine, a socialist journal, as the “most dangerous of the 
  Negro publications”—a quotation which Randolph and his co&#8209;editor Chandler 
  Owen promptly used as an advertising blurb.  But in 1919 the <i>Messenger</i> 
  still had the national resources of the Socialist Party to support it; when 
  that went away in a few years, they no longer used that line as an advertising 
  blurb</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Before I finish, I want to mention two other poets 
  who turn up in Hoover’s A&#8209;list.  One was Walter Everett Hawkins, a poet 
  frequently included in the <i>Messenger</i>.  His poem “Where Air of Freedom 
  Is” is among those that you can find in the government publications as evidence 
  of “radicalism and sedition among Negroes as reflected in their publications.” 
  Investigators cited this poem as particularly offensive:</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I will not yield to men!</span></p>
<p style='line-height:24.0pt'>Another poet was Fenton Johnson in Chicago, whose 
  work I describe in my book <i>Extraordinary Measures</i>.  Johnson was a very 
  interesting poet—avant&#8209;garde in style.  He started publishing poems around 
  1913 in the dialect poetry style of Paul Laurence Dunbar, which was enormously 
  popular at the time.  But then he progressed into a kind of prose poetry.  Johnson, 
  was, in fact, silenced by the attention of J. Edgar Hoover and his agents.  
  Because Johnson had simply a little magazine, he had no one to “watch his back.” 
  He did not have the hundred thousand NAACP members behind him.  He did not have 
  the funding of the Socialist Party behind him.  And, after 1921, this most promising 
  African&#8209;American poet, a pioneer of modernist technique, is not heard 
  from again until he turns up in the 1930s—glum and aging—on the Federal Writers’ 
  Project in Chicago where he worked briefly with Richard Wright, Margaret Walker,  
  and others. </p>
<p style='line-height:24.0pt'><span> </span>           One of the poems that brought 
  Fenton Johnson under the scrutiny of the special unit that eventually became 
  the FBI was his parody of the Psalms printed in his <i>Favorite Magazine,</i> 
  in the Autumn1920 issue, called “Prayer for our Enemies”:</p>
