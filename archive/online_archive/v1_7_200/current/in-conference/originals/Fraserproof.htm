<p><span>      </span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Until September 11, we had remained largely innocent 
  and untouched as American writers, in the sense that we had never—in actuality—been 
  required to so fully understand the meaning of vulnerability to physical attack 
  and siege in our own cities...and its on-going fall-out, as experienced in our 
  daily level of wariness.  With recent terrorist assaults, all terms have changed.  
  We have been leveled and, in one profound way, can begin to imagine more deeply 
  the fear and daily pain of that greater part of our human species.  Our psychic 
  bearings are now shaken, our trust in language is under intense and on-going 
  scrutiny.  I cannot imagine this changing for a very long time.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>As I’ve tried to think of what I could possibly say, 
  with surety, in this public context, I find that I’ve come up against silence.  
  I do not want to rush into anything or pretend to sure-footedness or an aspiration 
  to any particular model of new/newer/newest poetic language.  I am not ready, 
  nor will I be ready for some time.  The elements that have served, up to this 
  point, to alert and stir me have not changed that much—those of fragment and 
  disturbed syntax and visual cognate, but I am even more wary now of anything 
  that recommends itself as “speaking with one voice.” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Every day, I need clear thinking and attempt a language 
  that supports this, but I am suspicious of narrowly prescriptive behaviour in 
  any community of thought or writing practice.  I know that writing helps us 
  to focus and to bear witness and for that reason, it is the place where no one 
  should dare to imagine they could tell any one of us what appropriate behaviour 
  is in our writing practice.  For a poet, the lens hovers, goes out of focus, 
  returns unexpectedly...but what it leads one to is always provisional.  These 
  days, I often take a sketchbook where I go. I may or may not write in it.  Last 
  week I pasted in pieces of instruction from the SF Water company, printed in 
  Japanese script, Arabic and Russian because I found the visual characters of 
  each written language discretely beautiful even though their meanings carried 
  parallel information.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To try to speak of what one feels, or how 
  one wants to construct work in the future</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>proved elusive until I concluded that I could not 
  pull a plan together that fast.  I have not been writing poems in these weeks.  
  But I have been aware of the poignancy of human event in ways I’d lost connection 
  with, convinced I didn’t have—or shouldn’t take—the time.  Now I am back inside 
  time, in a different way.  While I could not bring myself, with sufficient focus, 
  to the questions I imagined as being of acute interest to this earlier constituted 
  gathering, I decided that anything I’d noticed in these last days could now 
  be considered as relevant to our considerations of language and its survival.  
  I thought, then, that I might share some randomly chosen bits from daily notebook 
  entries over the last month...including several brief narratives, a meditation 
  on Oppen, and observations on media language collecting in my sketchbook.<b></b></p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>The phone rings early and wakes me up. It’s Richard 
  wanting to know if I’ve heard the news.  He gives me the headlines and I hang 
  up and turn on the radio, not wanting to wake Arthur who is still sleeping; 
  his heart rhythms are irregular and I don’t want to risk the unknown effects 
  of sudden alarming events. Timing, information, priorities, language.  Everything 
  has changed in the beat of a heart.  All day we sit in front of the TV, trying 
  to determine the difference between the real and the surreal. Yesterday they 
  seemed clearly legible categories.   During the day we watch Peter Jennings.  
  At night we watch Ted Koppel and Charlie Rose and the apparently thoughtful 
  cross-section of experts they interview.  For the first time in my life, I am 
  grateful to these men for their candid questions and calm demeanor, listening 
  through them for any new shred of analysis or differing perspective that might 
  import an enlightened moment. </p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>Woke up at least ten times during the night...finally 
  rose, with jaw aching from stress.  Another day glued to the TV, still unable 
  to focus, summon the will to think about previously intended work.  My British 
  friend, having been a child during the Second World War, emails me condolences 
  &amp; writes “One gets used to anything, finally, my dear Caterina...”  I cannot 
  find words to write back.  I don’t want to learn to “get used to anything”.

<p style='line-height:200%'>Email from Manny, 14, just starting his freshman year 
  at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, 4 blocks from the WTC...comes in on 
  the subway from Brooklyn every morning...arrived on the 11th about an hour before 
  the first tower was hit.   He writes:  “I was in school when a voice crackled 
  over the loudspeaker reporting that one of the World Trade Centers had exploded 
  for some reason or another.  We looked outside but, being on the north side, 
  could see nothing except a constant stream of fire engines, ambulances, and 
  police cars rushing down the West Side Highway.  At this point the depth of 
  the situation hadn’t sunk in to any of us, so we all proceeded to third period.  
  It was there that my teacher, being the heartless, ignorant pig that he is, 
  committed a series of acts rivaled in evil only by the suicide crashes themselves: 
  first, he closed the blinds and turned the lights off to prevent anything from 
  distracting us from his precious lesson, the most important thing in the universe.  
  Then, he proceeded to resume the lesson of the day.  And, to top it all off, 
  when a girl innocently asked what was going on outside, he responded by saying 
  that ‘the World Trade Center was bombed once before; how was this any different 
  or more important?’”  <b><u></u></b></p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>Six days since the attack.  Decide not to start the 
  day with TV.  Only hear NPR when crossing the city by car. Torn between the 
  need to stay abreast of latest developments and its opposite—to reclaim some 
  simple daily rituals. Compelled only by personal contact: email, telephone calls, 
  shared texts—emotional, spiritual, political, medical information being passed 
  around.  Warnings of computer viruses. Reading in all directions, trying to 
  educate myself, understanding huge gaps of information...and our willingness 
  not to know.  Looking at the paper and wondering which of today’s stories have 
  been planted to soften us up, how much of it is propaganda...and whose?</p>

<p style='line-height:

  media, I find two pieces of paper.  One has a printed quote from Simone Weil.  
  The other is a faded xerox of pages 134 &amp; 135—the final section of a discussion 
  of H.D.’s writing by Marianne Moore, which ends with this distinction:  “...we 
  have heroics which do not confuse transcendence with domination and which, in 
  their indestructibleness, are the core of tranquility and of intellectual equilibrium.”</p>

  voices of the guys who do the play-by-play broadcasts of football games every 
  weekend, all autumn long. Their excitement leaks under my study door and then 
  I realize it’s actually media reporters interviewing CNN’s military strategist.  
  They are yelling out their questions at him like stock exchange traders; they 
  are trading bomb tonnage statistics.  Minutes later, it IS the football game...language 
  sets rattling on, from channel to channel, with the same sense of urgency.</p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>In today’s Arts section of the paper, Steven Winn 
  reviews John O’Keefe’s currently running play on Robert Graves and Laura Riding 
  Jackson.  The two principle characters are described as “A haunted Graves” and 
  “the self-dramatizing writer Laura Riding”.  O’Keefe, we are told, has “cut 
  and fit the historical record to keener dramatic purpose”.  The story ends with 
  this comment: “Graves’ terrible memories of the trenches hover and shadow everything.  
  ‘I liked the feeling of really being frightened,’ Graves says with a dreamy 
  intensity.  Nothing can ever be the same after living through a war.”</p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>Megan calls with an extra ticket to the Friday night 
  Giants game.  She knows from an earlier conversation that I’ve been dying to 
  see Barry Bonds in-the-flesh, against the backdrop of the new baseball stadium 
  just recently plunked down right at the edge of the Bay.  Megan’s family has 
  tickets because her son, Reese—whose parenting she shares with Bob and her partner, 
  Angie (Reese’s birth-mother)—is scheduled to sing “The Star-spangled Banner” 
  with the SF Boys choir, who’ve been chosen to open the game’s festivities.  
  Angie’s seat is now mine because she must cover third base for The Flying Trouts—her 
  own softball team—on Friday night.  Bob, my long-time friend and Reese’s father, 
  is coming along too so we decide to meet at the entrance early and walk up the 
  various ramps and through as many tiers and seating charts as the door guards 
  will allow, just to check-out the crowd, the angle of visibility from behind 
  home-plate, the famous garlic fries &amp; Krispy Kreme donuts &amp; the Polish 
  sausage varieties for later purchase.  We end up just below the giant fielder’s 
  mitt next to the monster COKE bottle sculpture pouring continuous neon.</p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>Earlier in the week, Bob and I bump into each other 
  at a friend’s reading at City Lights and decide to have dinner together afterwards 
  at one of our favorite restaurants in North Beach, a place called The Helmand 
  (named for the longest river in Afghanistan), with its exotic cuisine of brown-sugared 
  pumpkin and melting eggplant, where the lamb shanks fall off the bone every 
  time.  Most of the happy eaters are already digging-in when we come through 
  the door.  We sit down amidst a full house of regulars who’ve gathered to show 
  solidarity with Daud and the local Afghanistani community.  We are told that 
  two days before, someone ripped away the beautiful curved tubular awning leading 
  to the door of his restaurant.  They’d spat at the front window and yelled insults 
  at him as he stood behind it.  But we were lucky. A week had passed since September 
  11 and people were beginning to gain a little equilibrium.  A guy from a neighboring 
  table was passing the hat, collecting money for families of firemen killed in 
  the Twin Towers collapse. We opened our wallets gratefully and breathed in an 
  air filled with the scent of turmeric.</p>

<p style='line-height:200%'>My Pilates instructor tells me that two planes have 
  crashed into the airport terminal in Rome, so I rush home to turn on the TV, 
  assuming the story will be covered.   I feel how Rome is my second home; I’m 
  worried for friends just as I’d be for friends in NYC.  Over the next hour’s 
  viewing, I see only the last half of a single-sentence headline moving—once—across 
  the bottom of the screen.  It tells me only that the crash was in Milano—foggy 
  air field, smaller plane turning Left instead of Right, causing collision. Not 
  a terrorist action.  Meanwhile, I’ve begun to notice the odd pecking order of 
  media events and begin to write down the language: </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>“Military stocks UP on Wall St.”  marches by next 
  to “Rush Limbaugh says he’s going deaf...will be completely so within two months”—this 
  news strip, looped-in, over and over, with major world events.  Rush gets equal 
  billing, that morning, with Colin Powell.  Fifteen minutes later, a CNN reporter 
  agrees with his interview subject, “We should speak with one voice.” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>“Only ten percent do not support the President...who 
  ARE all these people, anyway?” the excited voice of the sportscaster asks his 
  news buddy.  Later, reporting the 2nd day air strike, a voice narrates sound 
  bites behind the images: “No British presence. It’s all an American show”;  
  “New chief of ‘homeland’ defense, Tom Ridge.”  Since when did “homeland” enter 
  our description of the U.S.?  I get a Second World War feeling at the back of 
  my neck...what <i>was</i> that German word?

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span> </span>I keep thinking about Oppen...why I’ve 
  persistently remembered his voice reading his poems, over these last days since 
  September 11.  It was just before Christmas in 1966, when I first heard him 
  read.  It had been snowing heavily for several days and the sidewalks in front 
  of St. Marks Poetry Project had been shoveled and re/shoveled at least three 
  times in twenty-four hours. I was more than a week overdue with my first child 
  and wanted to believe in the possibility of continuing.  In Oppen’s low voice, 
  that night, I could hear no easy hope...but immense pain, rage, scepticism, 
  resistance—unsupported by the theatre of rhetoric.  Every word seemed fought 
  for—a poetry discovered, cut apart, let go, repositioned.  Certainly a poetry 
  that left ease behind.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>It may be that, even then, I could trust him because 
  he left us with no place for guile or chosen innocence. It was a severity I’d 
  managed to avoid until then. I had no choice but to face a new level of difficulty, 
  holding the dualistic claims of inevitable tragedy, while knowing I wanted to 
  persist and to make a writing of my own signature.  In Oppen’s work I heard 
  a voice of such immense gravity and fragmentation and coherence that it seemed 
  to eclipse all I’d been drawn to in those dazzling and glamorous and witty New 
  York days.  There was no rush into print, no performance or sense of writing 
  for applause.  Instead of facility, I heard words struggling up out of silence.  
  The survival of Ishmael, of Job: “And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.” 
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>He’d survived, but there was no hubris in it.  Just 
  the need—this unavoidable claim on him—to make a true human accounting of his 
  life, severe, even-handed in its carefully joined and separated parts.  He was 
  telling the fact of his witness and his writing practice—a hand-carpentered 
  artifact with the sound of its own making—poised at the edge of a vision that 
  found no comfort in the flag-imbedded codes of a single voice.  The words were 
  minimal; the decisions of line and silence gave evidence of breathing and of 
  presence in that silence—empty tempo even—in which to rest and to take in what 
  had accrued, before rushing forward...weighted with news of still being here, 
  in spite of everything he’d seen and heard as a soldier in the world.  </p>

  morning I go into Top of the Hill market—our local “momma &amp; poppa” store—to 
  thank Frank for the two tickets he passed on to us for yesterday’s Giants game 
  and to tell him my version of why our team lost their chance to move into the 
  finals.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>            </span> “I heard it was a real lousy 
  game,” he says.  “Sorry about that.”</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>            </span>“Hey, Frank,” I tell him, 
  “it was fun anyway. I <i>already</i> got to see Barry hit his 67th Friday night, 
  so what the hell...it was just fun to be there and watch the guys working out.  
  I think I’m turning into a fan!” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Frank and his brother lease the store space on the 
  ground floor of the corner building. Hanging from the second floor window of 
  the apartment above them—almost touching the sidewalk and almost covering the 
  fruit-filled window—is an immense American flag, suspended vertically, with 
  its red-and-white stripes looking like a great collapsed tent or awning.  It 
  is major code language and I speculate that, in some sense, it must make Frank’s 
  older brother, Sal, feel safe.  But Frank is more sceptical than Sal. If I were 
  to ask him about it, he’d probably go into a state of quizzical ambivalence—his 
  left eyebrow raised in silent comment above an otherwise boyish grin.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I have to talk extra-loud. Frank is almost deaf, after 
  a series of operations, performed in the last few years before he turned thirty-five. 
  No one is in the store, at the moment, so he doesn’t have to watch the mirror 
  trained on the back aisles.  We begin to talk about the pleasure of watching 
  baseball on home turf at the new stadium—how its architecture gives everyone 
  a shot at views of the bridge and the water.  I can see him visibly opening 
  as he confesses that he still goes to spring training every year. “Baseball...it’s 
  like part of my life...I mean, it’s just something you do every day,” he says, 
  looking sideways at me, a bit sheepishly. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“You workin’ on any books?” he asks me, 
  and I tell him the short version of what’s going on since I know he’s really 
  curious. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>But when he begins to tell me about an idea he has 
  for a movie, I can feel myself shifting into fore-shortened perspective—half 
  of me is already leaning back towards my own work deadline, safe and focused 
  behind my shut door.  But something stops me. Frank’s face is telling me something 
  he’s never told anyone.  How we got here I do not know.  The Sunday papers are 
  stacked high and the fresh bagels crowd the plastic case. He’s telling me about 
  his imagination...he’s just so pleased to find out how it works, like someone 
  bragging about their kid’s unexpected talents. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>            </span>“It’s like I get this picture—this 
  one idea from which an entire set of events begins to unfold...I don’t have 
  to do nothin’...it just starts coming into my head.  You know, I think I could 
  really be a movie director.” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>            </span>“Tried writing any of it 
  down yet, Frank?” I ask out of curiosity.  He looks to see if I’m serious.  
  “You know me, Frank. Writer, here.  You have to get that stuff on paper so you 
  can look at it. Work it over... Do it, Frank.”  He seems happy and gets a far-off 
  look in his eye.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Frank and his folks came over to the U.S. from Lebanon 
  when he was in sixth grade.  Last summer, he took a vacation from the store 
  for the first time in years and went up to a small lakeside town, north and 
  in-land from S.F., where one of his customers had gone, a month earlier, for 
  her summer break.  She told him about it. She made it sound good...and it was 
  good.  He’d like to go back.  The people were real nice.</p>
