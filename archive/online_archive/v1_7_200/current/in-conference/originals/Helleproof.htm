<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'>In our linked essays on the status 
  of gender as a critical category in modernism, Mary DeShazer and I are interested 
  in the question, “What new ground needs to be broken, what new questions explored?”  
  We bring a particular interest in the relation of modernism’s aesthetic traditions 
  to rhetorics of emancipation across national boundaries, including but not limited 
  to and interest in feminist rhetorics and their sociopoetic implications.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Critical overviews of gender and modernism have acknowledged 
  the substantial legacies of gynocriticism (enlarging the canon of female modernists) 
  and gynesis (the feminine as metaphor of historical process and/or reading effect 
  in texts by men and women).   Marianne DeKoven’s deconstructive analysis of 
  gender as the <i>sous-rature</i><i> </i>of high modernism predicts that as we 
  learn more about the “variegated manifestations” of gender and modernism, gender 
  may appear as an “unsynthesized” dialectic” that seeks neither unity or resolution 
  (<i>The Cambridge Companion to Modernism</i>, 192).  A transnational feminist 
  focus on women and gender has sometimes been defined as a concentration on socio-political 
  contingencies of women’s modernity, as distinguished from literary modernism, 
  which focuses on the cultural aspects (Lowe and Lloyd).  But such separations 
  are too rigid for the study of modernism and gender in transnational locations, 
  and may contribute to discursive hardening.  We find that when questions of 
  gender and modernism migrate across national boundaries, they reveal differences 
  in the time-levels of modernity, in the socio-economic-political conditions, 
  and different constructions of the category of the aesthetic, all of which need 
  to be taken into account.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>         </span>Rita Felski’s historicist and 
  interdisciplinary approach to the criss-crossing of the aesthetic and the political 
  in <i>The Gender of Modernity</i> (1995) and <i>Doing Time </i>(2000) is exemplary 
  of a supple and flexible attitude toward “locational” constructions of gender 
  and modernity.  For something <i>has </i>happened to enlarge the discursive 
  and material categories in which gender appears since “around 1990,” when Bonnie 
  Kime Scott’s introduction to a “new scope of gender and modernism” included 
  “cultural critiques” as only one among a long list of gendered modernism’s many 
  dimensions (14-15).  By Felski’s account, the cultural meanings of modernity<a
href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a> 
  have enlarged to include all of the following: 1) an unfinished revolution around 
  the rhetoric of liberty and self-expression; 2) debates about the gendered public 
  sphere and avant-garde institutions; 3) debates about gender within modernism’s 
  global reach; 4) documents, reports, manifestos, and literary expressions articulating 
  a  gendered basis for the “experience of modernity” (see also Clark 1991; Appadurai 
  1996;  Lyon 1999).  As cultural meanings of modernity have become more prismatic, 
  gender has become more refractive of these differential debates.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a> The starting question Felski would have 
  us ask thus takes the “cultural” as a primary term: “How do established approaches 
  to gender and modernism fall short of women’s participation in the varied cultures 
  of modernity?”   In 1990, Bonnie Kime Scott’s publication of <i>Gender and Modernism, 
  </i>at the time an important synthesis,<i> </i>appears retrospectively to have 
  marked the <i>emergence </i>of questions (with the historical weight that “emergence” 
  implies), amidst a <i>wide matrix of influences</i> and ever-expanding questioning 
  of cultural location.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a> Our genealogical maps of this emergence 
  would insistently include gender as a critical category in conjunctures of gender 
  and genre, as well as gender and race relations; they include local/global cross-cultural 
  encounters that have been especially significant for analyzing non-elite subjects 
  and genres despised by modernism (genres  such as elegy, autobiography, political 
  orature); they may include the splicings of public and private in traumas of 
  dislocation  and catastrophes of migration. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>         </span>I have been working on a project 
  that concerns problems in the containment of representation for gender and genre 
  relations, specifically in modern American poetry’s gendered constructions of 
  elegy.  The dynamics of genre and gender containment participate in the ironies 
  of modernism’s “making new” and within a variety of claims about modern American 
  poetry’s claims to status in a new global field.   Susan Stewart has theorized 
  the way cultural processes of  “distressing” genres—rescuing, refurbishing, 
  or antiquing old genres—is one way that modernity renders strangeness familiar, 
  recreating the desire for speaking objects as touchstones  of public memory 
  and  self-reference  (66-67).   The heroic, monumental modernism of figures 
  such as Pound, and later Olson, is well known to have globalized an aesthetic 
  of loss and recovery, promoting the disappearance and reappearance of a past 
  as an archive of modern memory.  Through such processes—of reading backward 
  into generic histories, and re-gendering their traditions—the idea of what counts 
  as losses worth mourning in poetry and the styles appropriate to modern lament  
  (whether openly emotive or rigorously analytical) sometimes becomes more narrowly 
  archived.   Hence elegy is declared “over” for modernism with Pound’s warning 
  about the dangerous “precipice of lamentation,” and yet elegy continues to leave 
  its distressed imprint on American lyric poetry well into mid-century, with 
  the proliferation of family elegy in the confessional lyric.<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a>   Yet from 
  the perspective of a the varied cultures of female modernity that Felski asks 
  us to acknowledge, the modern elegiac tradition is clearly a broader one, including 
  the language of public and civic rhetoric as well as the writing of disaster 
  around historical trauma, genocide, forced migration or mass epidemics (AIDS 
  elegy being only the most obvious recent example the problem of containment 
  and resignifying of gender and genre).  The globalization of modernist aesthetics, 
  with its neo-romantic fascination with loss, nostalgia, and remembered-forgetting, 
  appears from a transnational feminist perspective less an erasure of the past, 
  a melancholic mourning (in the sense of a Kristevan semiotic), than an encryptment 
  of uncomfortable narratives about cultural violence.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>              </span>The complex poetic testimonies 
  of American modernist Muriel Rukeyser</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>(and her frequent, lavish invocation of  elegy) serve 
  as an example of the phenomenon  of “distressing” genres and reworking historically 
  uncomfortable gendered associations.   Rukeyser’s “The Dam” (one of the few 
  formally experimental poems by female modernists anthologized in the Pierre 
  Joris and Jerome Rothenberg 1995 anthology of international modernism, <i>Poems 
  for the Millennium</i>)<i> </i>recognizes America as the symbol of modernity’s 
  dream of globalized power; her poem, “The Book of the Dead” renders America’s 
  determined blindness to class and race relations as a type of historical forgetting.  
  The representations of silicon dust, exposure to which resulted in the deaths 
  of working class and black migrant laborers in the largest industrial disaster 
  of the twentieth century at that time, allow contradictory readings.  Lethal 
  yet illuminating—a shining, permeating white substance—dust covers the North 
  American landscape and penetrates its dreams.  Recently critics have suggested 
  that Rukeyser’s frequent use of a   dialogic structure foregrounding local differences 
  in representing roads, bridges, dams, and other symbols of America’s modernity 
  also works to counteract nationalistic discourses that gloss such differences  
  (Lowney 196).  Rukeyser insists on resignifying the rhetorical as well as poetic 
  traditions of civic elegy, from a narrow focus on individuated and nationalistic 
  losses, to a poetic mourning bowed by the weight of the collective.   In a later 
  poem about the rise of fascism between world wars, “Kathe Kollwitz,” she conjures 
  the threat of  historical again trauma by joining an image of global  production 
  (borrowing also the imagery of Kollwitz’s <i>Lamentation</i>) with the image 
  of modern death—the  “big hands of the world  of death.“  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>          </span>Yet for all her commitment 
  to working through the relationship between ideology and linguistic expression, 
  Rukeyser’s reception among modernist contemporaries on the left and the right 
  is also gendered.  For some of the same reasons that she is not always seen 
  as formally experimental, her insistence on blending mourning with outrage was 
  misrecognized.  At the <i>Partisan Review, </i>her poems written to mourn and 
  commemorate deaths of marines and civilian volunteers who defended Wake Island 
  in the Pacific during World War II earned her the disparaging label “poster 
  girl of Wake Island,” transforming her reputation from serious poet to political 
  bunny among left-wing intellectuals (Brock 258).  The reasons for their disparagement 
  are complex: the poems include a high-flown rhetoric of political orature with 
  a patient eye for documentary methods and refusal to keep emotion under wraps.  
  Rukeyser’s poetic is conscious of coloring, not only emotional coloring in the 
  traditional impressionistic sense, but the relation of emotional coloring to 
  the role of racialized histories of violence    Her dreams of poetry’s emotional 
  power and modernity’s encrypted violence is such that it requires active struggle 
  with such a range and variety of genres as to indicate forms “forever broken 
  and remade.” </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span>       </span>As we consider the varied cultures 
  of female modernity in relation to modernism’s gendered literary practices, 
  it may be important, as Susan Friedman (1998) has argued,  that  transnational 
  feminist practice apply the lessons of situational and relational criticism 
  to the politics of knowledge and the act of criticism itself.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a>  
  This entails exploring reflexively an ethics and a politics of style in critical 
  writing, as well as interpretative method.  Friedman urges that significant 
  components of an ethics and a politics of style includes recognition of varied 
  audiences for investigations of gendered modernism across national boundaries.  
  Such inquiry may call into question the status of textuality itself across these 
  boundaries; it can and should raise questions about what voices might be involved 
  or included within the telling and retelling of cultural narratives that fill 
  in the gendered gaps (Friedman 33-35).  What recently emerges from attention 
  to such risks is also a heightened geopolitical sensitivity to the questions 
  that may be especially invoked by space or place, as well as the differences 
  between the enounced and the subject of the enunciation.  For instance, in our 
  collaborative writing Mary DeShazer and I evoke a familiar gynocritical trope 
  of collaboration.  However, in constructing “linked papers,” together yet separate, 
  our intention is not to fuse homogeneous perspectives at a singular horizon, 
  but to suggest several variations on the theme of what happens when questions 
  of gendered modernism migrate across national boundaries, opening a space for 
  dialogue and differences. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Opportunities to historicize critical practices of 
  reading gender and modernism also remind us that if we expect to get beyond 
  either-or stalemates (those that may divide perspectives developed from within 
  literary criticism, for example, from those perspectives which develop from 
  within a women’s studies focus on transnational identities), we need to understand 
  how to make interrelated reading strategies, tropes, assumptions of “reading 
  on the move” more visible.  For starters, as Friedman argues, we may want to 
  pinpoint how aspects of gynetics and gynocriticism (themselves cultural constructs) 
  already have and continue to be mutually interwoven, enlarged, qualified, and 
  extended in transnational contexts.   Such critical practices may invoke a kind 
  of focused wandering, even a pleasure in the theoretical awkwardness of asymmetry 
  and disjunction.<a href="#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a>   Here are 
  a few of the critical practices and assumptions that may be especially productive 
  as the status of gender as a critical category in modernism continues to challenge 
  fixed boundaries:</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1. <i>The practice 
  of refusing the modernist narrative of rupture with the 19<sup>th</sup> century</i></span></b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. 
  </span></i>This reading practice revises, amplifies, and extends the move of 
  Bonnie Kime Scott (7) and others to put modernism’s temporalities “under erasure” 
  in an effort to expose historical exclusions of women writers from canons, periodicities, 
  and generic practices.  Refusals of rupture in style and periodization has productively 
  revealed modernism’s deeper continuities (the continued presence of realism 
  and melodrama, for instance) and interweavings of masculine and feminine within 
  male and female-authored texts.  Yet ruptures of the “new” and social crises 
  of representation are not simply mimetic of each other, or readable as synchronous 
  moments.  Paul Gilroy is eloquent on the point that the “double consciousness” 
  of black modernity may need to include the double consciousness of temporalities, 
  since it absorbs, from within and outside Western rhetoric, the language of 
  enlightenment rationality and democratic traditions of free expression (48).  
  The expectation that gendered expressions of black Atlanticism might necessarily 
  express a stylistic break with the canons of 19<sup>th</sup> century poetic 
  expressions then, may be as narrow as the old expectation that modern blank 
  Atlanticism, is cut off from traditions of international modernist experimentation 
  as a primary source of inspiration and ambition.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. The practice 
  of resisting formal linguistic “experimentation” as the privileged</span></i></b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>center of modernist 
  creativity.</span></i></b><i><span>  </span></i><span> </span>Related to 1 (and 
  well underway), Scott’s gathering of</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>representative modernist 
  voices at numerous points cautions against equating formal</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>conservativism with political quiescence.  Notably, 
  this is the argument made by Celeste</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Schenck for inclusion of émigré Australian poet Anna 
  Wickham, whose “modernism” might be evaluated through a number of differential 
  axes, and certainly by more than her relation to traditions privileging linguistic 
  experimentation.  Rachel Blau DuPlessis has articulated a practice of reading 
  termed “social philology,” which augments the challenge of modernism’s “deep 
  textures” (26) and sociopolitical coding to reveal national mediations and intertextualities 
  of cross-racial representations.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>8</span></a>  As cultures of modernity (and women’s 
  place in them) become more prismatic, we may want to ask, “How many ways are 
  there to experiment?  Does experimentation in traditional forms of civic rhetoric, 
  where the subject involves shifts in lyric forms of address, count as part of 
  an aesthetic tradition of linguistic experimentation?”  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3. <i>The practice 
  of reading incorporation and melancholia as cultural symptoms</i></span></b><i>.  
  </i>This is part of the large-scale project of reconsidering the gendering of 
  emotion in modernism, a project to which my own explorations of pathos and Mary 
  DeShazer’s explorations of languages of liberation in political orature contributes.  
  Melancholia, as Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok teach us, is a term of historical 
  structure, as well as figural content.  Their revisionary interpretation of 
  the modernist tomb, crypt, word within the psyche as a “gaps left within us 
  by the secrets of others” (171-76) and opens the way for new interpretations 
  of poetry’s critical relationship to public memory.  Whereas incorporation and 
  encryption may be considered in some way a failure in the psychic limits of 
  imagining and representing the losses of others in terms recognizable by and 
  including the social body, the traditional meanings of introjection (“healthy 
  mourning,” in the Freudian scheme), may be re-envisioned as a way to describe 
  an acceptance of processes which demand negotiation and transformation of the 
  boundaries of the isolate self and the isolated nation.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><i>4. The practice of locating the material and 
  discursive markers of “diasporic” reading.   Fluidity, polyphony, palimpsest, 
  border-crossing, migration</i></b>—when these are deployed metaphorically—can 
  make strange bedfellows with postcolonial and feminist transnational critique 
  in an era when modernity’s global “flows” can have benign or, as  we have seen, 
  catastrophic consequences.  Metaphorical inflections as part of our critical 
  vocabularies can enlarge or reduce effects of power, fleshing out its manifestations 
  in the imagination of universal embodiments, or enhancing and intertwining specific 
  histories.  From Euro-American perspective, as a number of feminist critics 
  interested in transnational practice have noted, such tropes in academic criticism 
  have enjoyed the privilege of association with modern aestheticism and histories 
  of cultural exoticism, often within the very trajectories and locations of loss 
  and power that interests in re-theorizing and remaking gendered identities seek 
  to redress and de-naturalize (Massey 1994; Kaplan 1996).  The ongoing, complex 
  deployments of gender in modernism are such that specifying whatever we will 
  mean by reading gender diasporically, “on the move,” and in relation to global 
  scenes of historical trauma across a long twentieth century will be a task both 
  difficult and necessary.</p>

    the term “cultural” are inevitably in play (and at stake) in historically 
    specific references to uses of gender within feminist cultural criticism of 
    the last decade.  In a useful move, Appadurai (14-15) recognizes that tension 
    between the anthropological use of “culture” as an adjective to describe dimensions 
    of phenomenon, and the humanities-based  notions of “culture” with respect 
    to aesthetic expressions and movements, often universalized in its meanings,  
    may require the use of the term “culturalist” to refer to the rhetoric of 
    groups “consciously in the making.”  Appadurai’s proposal for a distinct use 
    of “culturalist” is logically intertwined with feminist cultural history’s 
    interest in “rhetorics” as intertwined with “poetics.”</p>

    use of gender as a critical category has not taken over the field, nor have 
    deployments of gender as a critical category (broadly considered to include 
    studies which touch on women and gender in modernism, gay/lesbian/queer theory-inspired 
    critiques, critiques of heteromasculinity, and studies of performativity of 
    gender) have ranged from 1 in 40 (in 1994) to 1 of 5 or 6 (in 1996 and 1997) 
    to 1 in 8 or 9 in 2000-01.  In <i>PMLA</i>, 7 of 17 articles on modern authors 
    and topics published between 1996 and 1999 used gender as one among a spectrum 
    of relevant critical differences.  Thanks to Patrick Query for assistance

    philology,” according to DuPlessis, demonstrates an attentiveness to the “events

    to socio-political detail and expressive dissonance, slippages, affirmations, 
    and quirks within a range of verbal acts from discourses to the level of the
