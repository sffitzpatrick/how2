<h1>Elisabeth Frost</h1>
<p style='line-height:200%'>This special section of “Readings” emerges from a 
  panel at the Modernist Studies Association meeting, held in Houston just one 
  month after September 11.  In the wake of the attacks, it wasn’t clear that 
  anybody would be in Houston for the MSA—we didn’t even know if the conference 
  would be held.  Nor was it apparent that our own commitments to the panel (“Modernist 
  Influence on Contemporary Poetry”) could be maintained even if the conference 
  did go on as scheduled.  As coordinators, Michael Bibby, Cynthia Hogue, and 
  I were extremely grateful to Kathleen Fraser, Carla Harryman, and Lorenzo Thomas 
  for gathering to discuss questions of unmistakable urgency in the light of a 
  changing political and cultural landscape.  What emerged was a set of innovative 
  and, in my view, extremely important reflections on poetry post-9-11.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The original purpose of the panel was to explore diverse 
  experiments fostered by modernist poetic radicalism—those somewhat outside of 
  commonly recognized “avant-gardes,” such as Language writing/theorizing.  We 
  were interested in “other” innovations, often taking place within recognizable 
  lyric and narrative forms.  Our three poets were to read their work; then the 
  panel would open to a roundtable discussion about how modernism has influenced 
  (perhaps frustrated, complicated) their writing.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span> </span>           Following 9-11, we began 
  to discuss the need for a broader perspective.  There was (and is) a new self-consciousness 
  about doing what we do.  We asked ourselves: Are priorities the same, for ourselves 
  as poets, critics, teachers?  What is the “relevance” of poetry in a time of 
  war, of terrorism, of heated nationalism?  What are the issues that newly confront 
  us as writers, teachers, readers of contemporary and modern poetry?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The papers that follow all engage variously with these 
  questions.  Michael Bibby recounts our e-mail discussions preceding the conference 
  to consider new meanings of “innovation” that might move beyond the avant-gardist 
  rhetoric of rupture toward a poetry of “suture.”  Two essays in this section 
  were originally presented at that MSA panel: Kathleen Fraser documents acts 
  of witnessing, culled from journal entries in the days immediately following 
  9-11.  To contextualize the current political climate, Lorenzo Thomas returns 
  to the literary scene during and after World War I, with a detailed chronology 
  of censorship, racial politics, and artistic repression.  Finally, an additional 
  paper by Frances Presley provides a view from London, considering architecture, 
  the spectacle of grief, and the “building” of a new avant-garde poetics.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Especially in the weeks immediately following 9-11, 
  the limits of language came up again and again, whether in informal e-mail exchanges 
  or in mass media representations.  In the “Postcards” section of How2, many 
  wrote in to recount the painful sense of being speechless—as writers, as citizens, 
  a condition of trauma.  In one of the more mainstream articulations of this 
  sense of being robbed of words, Eric McHenry noted Auden’s critique and ultimate 
  rejection of “September 1, 1939” (which emerged as the ur-poem of 9-11).  McHenry 
  argues that by expressing a sense of his own failure in the poem, “Auden kept 
  in play the possibility—by no means a certainty—that there are sorrows even 
  the most well-chosen words can’t reach.”<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup> [1] </sup></a>  But is it perhaps that the <i>expected</i> 
  forms of words can’t reach us?  In other words, that the “new word,” the “news 
  that stays news,” is yet to be invented for this moment?  Perhaps, then, an 
  innovative poetics in the modernist or avant-garde tradition is precisely what 
  is needed?  Or, is the failure of language a response to trauma that any historical 
  or personal disaster might evoke?  What sorts of poetry can be responsive to 
  such inadequacies?  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>And, further, how can poetry respond in a cultural 
  atmosphere that has wrought measures to revoke civil liberties?  Things over 
  the last six months have hardly changed since the days following 9-11, when 
  TV journalists were asked to sign statements of allegiance, and others were 
  chastised or dismissed for “inappropriate” critiques of U.S. actions.  It is 
  a time when an academic forum (in October) was denounced by the chancellor of 
  his own university (CUNY) because faculty present “blamed United States foreign 
  policy and capitalist cultural messages” as an underlying cause of the attacks.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><sup> [2] </sup></a>  There are new surveillance and detention policies, 
  such as the sweeping USA Patriot Act.  In the words of Nat Hentoff, “never in 
  the history of the First Amendment has any suppression of speech been so sweeping 
  and difficult to contest as this one,” which allows the FBI to “demand from 
  bookstores and libraries the names of books bought or borrowed by anyone suspected 
  of involvement in ‘international terrorism’ or ‘clandestine activities.’”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup> 
  [3] </sup></a>  What becomes of writing and publishing in such a climate?  As 
  one example, consider that Barnes and Noble refused to carry Jonathan Tel’s 
  <i>Arafat’s Elephant</i>, a collection of short stories, unless the title was 
  changed.  (Since Tel refused, of the big chains, only Borders is carrying the 
  book.)  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>At the same time, In the midst of all this—from September 
  12 on—has come a widespread circulation of poems by e-mail, appearances in newspapers 
  and in memorials (both “official” and impromptu), with favorites including its 
  own modernist canon of Moore, Yeats, Heaney, Auden.  Whose “modernism” is this?  
  Whose poetics provides such epigrammatic comforts? </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>There has been a clarion call for a new “accessibility” 
  in our poetry.  Among others, this item from the <i>CLMP Newswire</i> concerning 
  New York City editors’ responses to “9-11”: Martha Rhodes of Four Way Books 
  describes “looking more for the essential in language and accessibility.  For 
  the leaner and meaner.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup> [4] </sup></a></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>My own response to shock and speechlessness in New 
  York City was the opposite—to need, desperately, for language to be pushed outward 
  or inward—to change and be changed, to be charged, remade.  What might <i>that</i> 
  new poetry look like?  What sources might it look back to?  And who will be 
  its readers?</p>
