<p><i>                        </i></p>
<p>—Muriel Rukeyser</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>In response to Adorno’s and Auden’s well-known despair, 
  Alicia Ostriker reminds us that the poet Muriel Rukeyser rejected both despair 
  and apathy.  Ostriker writes in her collection of essays, <i>Dancing at the 
  Devil’s Party: Essays on Poetry, Politics, and the Erotic</i>:</p>
<p>[T]here are those of us who disagree [with Auden and Adorno]. . . . Poetry 
  can, as Conrad puts it, make us <i>see</i>.  It can also, like Rilke’s torso 
  of Apollo, tell us that we must change our lives.  From time to time, some of 
  us believe, poetry changes the world.  I am of this (perhaps dotty) persuasion 
  and I have always enjoyed the work of visionary artists dissatisfied with the 
  rule of “things as they are” (i)—</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>The issue so darkly raised by Auden and Adorno, and 
  opposed in terms of the life-affirming by Rukeyser and Ostriker herself, has 
  to do with the commensurability of aesthetics and ethics.  It is not wrong to 
  subordinate art to history’s horrors, in Ostriker’s view; she urges us, however, 
  not to stop there.  That is, as she puts it, “the struggle can neither be won 
  nor abandoned” (“Beyond Confession” 35).  The site of this struggle—the witnessing, 
  the transmuting (i.e. the representing), the act of contemplative analysis (or 
  vision, if you will) that becomes the work of art—is a place where aesthetics 
  and ethics can meet synergistically.  Ostriker is interested specifically in 
  the poetics of postmodern witness.  I would like to consider, for the purposes 
  of this essay, that synergistic site itself, in order to contemplate more broadly 
  an ethical poetics.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Although ethical criticism has burgeoned in the last 
  decade, and was even the topic of a recent <i>PMLA </i>issue edited by Lawrence 
  Buell, the term <i>ethics</i> is somewhat fluidly defined.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>   For my purposes conceptually, I follow Julia Kristeva in such 
  early work as <i>Revolution in Poetic Language</i>, as well as the later <i>Tales 
  of Love</i>, <i>In the Beginning Was Love</i>, and <i>Nations Without Nationalism,</i> 
  because she theorizes both an ethical subject and artistic practice.  A practice 
  is ethical, she writes, “when it dissolves those narcissistic fixations (ones 
  that are narrowly confined to the subject) to which the signifying process succumbs 
  in its sociosymbolic relation” (<i>Revolution</i> 233<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a>).   The Law of the Symbolic is not simply internalized but shattered-within-unity.  
  An acknowledgment of the internal “stranger to ourselves”—what Emily Dickinson 
  called  “Ourself  behind ourself” (P 670)—mobilizes a radically ethical tolerance 
  for external differences.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I also follow Charles Altieri, who uses the term <i>ethical</i>, 
  in his essay “What Is Living and What Is Dead in Postmodernism,” to characterize 
  the desire on the part of postmodernist artists both to extend modernist formal 
  resistance to realist ideals and marketplace values, and to offer more plausible 
  ways than postmodern theory has of imagining alternatives to dominant ideologies 
  of mainstream culture:</p>
<p>Countering realism entails treating art less as a mode of referring directly 
  to the world than as an emphasis on the capacity of the artistic syntax to exemplify 
  ways of feeling, thinking, and imaginatively projecting investments not bound 
  to dominant social structures.<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><sup> [4] </sup></a>   <sup> </sup></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Concerned to theorize an expressivist ethics that 
  accords space and place to a moral and intentional subjectivity, Altieri asserts 
  that poets are better than theorists at envisioning poetic subjects with agency, 
  a “dynamic intentionality” that is inseparable from that with which we imbue 
  our speech (215).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>    
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I would like now to consider more specifically the 
  ethical stances of three exemplary poets: the syntax of thought and emotion 
  in their work, their thinking-through of dominance and one’s treatment of others.  
  <i> </i>I focus on three poets whose works are connected not only in their aesthetic 
  innovativeness, but also in being ethically motivated<i>—</i>Marianne Moore, 
  Alicia Ostriker, and Alice Fulton.  In listing these poets chronologically, 
  I am loosely indicating an American tradition of feminist, ethical poetics, 
  but I will not specifically be arguing that possibility in this essay.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Moore’s eccentric blend of liberal individualism 
  (which is at once an Enlightenment and Christian version<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span> 
  [6] </span></a>) and Modernist collage has camouflaged the ethical grain against 
  which she often writes.  She developed “an anti-poetic mode of expression that 
  rejected the self-centered, culturally imperialistic assumptions of both the 
  romantic and modernist eras as well” (Miller 17).  For Moore,  “a heteroglossic 
  . . . intertext of voices acts as a didactic tool of participatory education.  
  No singular and unambiguous voice instructs, but the poems push oppositionally 
  toward change” (Miller 6).  She construes such heteroglossic tension as a kind 
  of fortunate fall from the self-enclosed perfections of inherited poetic tradition 
  into the messy flaws of linguistic experiments.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Flaws and imperfections in Moore’s work 
  have ethical implications.  As Laurence Stapleton suggests of a relatively late 
  poem, “Tom Fool at Jamaica” (1953) (originally titled “Letter Perfect is not 
  Perfect”), they mark “a victory of sensibility over everything in one’s self 
  or in others that defeats life” (189): “Be infallible at your peril,” Moore 
  cautions (CP 162).  In perfect rhyming couplets of iambic tetrameter in “Enough: 
  <i>Jamestown, 1607-1957</i>,” Moore jarringly distills the deadly essence of 
  a nascent capitalism in our imperfectly realized notions of free enterprise: 
  “Marriage, tobacco, and slavery,/ initiated liberty” (CP 186),<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span> 
  [7] </span></a>  this—the colonists’ “history of treachery, genocide, and enslavement” 
  (Miller 151).  She portrays the colonists as concerned with fortune (“a search 
  for gold” [CP 186]) and fame (“could the most ardent have been sure/ that they 
  had done what would endure?” [CP 187]) rather than seeking ethically “what is 
  good” (CP 186).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            <i>Nothing </i>now marks the site of 
  Jamestown—“the site that did not flower” (CP 186), she dryly closes, and because 
  of this erasure, “it is <i>enough</i>/ if present faith mend partial proof” 
  (CP 187; emphasis added): in other words, if we believe the stories for lack 
  of ample evidence.  But these lines are ambiguous, for “mend” means “reform” 
  (in the religious sense of <i>amend</i>, improve in <i>morals</i>) as well as 
  “repair,” and “partial” not only means “in part” but “biased.”  Having throughout 
  the poem enumerated the colonists’ excesses (among them cannibalism), Moore 
  makes it difficult for readers to accept biased versions (“partial proofs”) 
  that whitewash (“mend”) the colonists’ reprehensible record.  It is “enough” 
  only <i>if</i>—the conditional (in)conclusively eloquent—the present, through 
  spiritual belief, can correct the flaws (both of character and culture) that 
  caused past wrongs. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Moore was a pacifist (albeit not a passivist), 
  and her question in the fifties, in the wake of McCarthy’s interrogations of 
  “un-American” activities, the Korean War, and the atom bomb testing<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span> 
  [8] </span></a> was how to valorize “American” individuality without encouraging 
  “egomania.”  As the speaker of another late poem, “Blessed Is the Man,” remarks, 
  “Blessed the geniuses who know// that egomania is not a duty” (CP 173).  The 
  poem continues: </p>
<p>            Blessed the man whose faith is different </p>
<p>                from possessiveness—of a kind not framed by “things which </p>
<p>                                                                                                
  do appear”—</p>
<p>                                                                                                
  (<i>CP</i> 174)    </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>The issue Moore raises is how to promote self-possession 
  without possessive individualism.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            This poem was published in <i>Ladies 
  Home Journal</i> in 1956, six years before C.B. MacPherson’s “classic analysis 
  of Western ‘possessive individualism’ (1962) trace[d] the seventeenth-century 
  emergence of an ideal self as owner: the [white, male] individual surrounded 
  by accumulated property,” as James Clifford, in his chapter on collecting art 
  and culture in his own classic analysis, <i>The Predicament of Culture</i>, 
  summarizes the ideological paradigm shift that so vitally contributed to the 
  philosophical foundations of America (Clifford 217).  As “Blessed Is the Man” 
  confirms, Moore contemplated the tension that characterizes the American ideal 
  of individualism—that is, the Lockean possessive individual and the Washingtonion 
  individual whose civic-mindedness tempers the self-aggrandizing, bourgeois individual’s 
  unfettered quest for profit.  The poem blesses “the man who does not denigrate, 
  depreciate, denunciate,” or “comply”; advocates “‘Diversity, controversy; tolerance’”; 
  and employs a metaphor from the language of housekeeping to portray moral vacuity—condemning 
  those authors “<i>mitin</i>-proofing conscience against character” (who, in 
  other words, put their conscience in “mothballs”).</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            In the late 1940s, after her mother’s 
  death, Moore very publicly refashioned herself as a Washingtonian figure, positioning 
  herself as a sort of transvestite “founding father” in order to assert a voice 
  authoritative enough to be heard.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span> 
  [9] </span></a>  Her self-fashioning made visible and readable some of the tensions 
  among self-aggrandizing, American individualism, radically Christian ethics, 
  and liberal democracy,<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span> [10] 
  </span></a> which dominant cultural ideology in the U.S. covers over.  But she 
  had long considered the linking of <i>poet</i> and <i>prophet,</i> which was 
  best exemplified for her in the Bible.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Take as illustration the poem that contains 
  lines often quoted as metapoetic, “The Past is the Present.”  The lines are: 
  “Ecstasy affords/ the occasion and expediency determines the form” (<i>CP </i>88).  
  The poem continues: “‘Hebrew poetry is prose/ with a sort of heightened consciousness’” 
  (<i>CP</i> 88).  The equivalence of Hebrew poetry with prose, formally asserted 
  by the line break after “prose,” is put into question by the enjambed semantic 
  qualification.  Is prose “‘with a <i>sort of</i> heightened consciousness’” 
  (emphasis added) poetry, prose, or something in between?  Moore’s notes attribute 
  this quoted statement to Dr. E. H. Kellogg of Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  In a 
  poem that takes up as <i>an issue</i> another kind of repetition—rhyme, which 
  it notes is “outmoded”—why is the poem’s speaker concerned with repeating Dr. 
  Kellogg’s words precisely (“He said—and I think I repeat his exact words”)?  
  Why quote precisely what may be, after all, Dr. Kellogg’s oratorial hemming 
  and hawing (“sort of”), which obscures rather than clarifies the precise nature 
  of Hebrew poetry?  Why introduce a phrase that calls into question the accuracy 
  of the quotation, moreover (“I think”), or open the poem in the conditional 
  (“<i>If</i> external action is effete/ <i>and</i> rhyme is outmoded,/ [<i>then</i>] 
  I shall revert to you,/ Habakkuk”; emphasis added)?  And why redefine such a 
  crucial word as ecstasy so oddly (a “sort of heightened consciousness”)?  The 
  poem takes formal issue with a Modernist economy forbidding verbal excess, not 
  only through the poem’s witty repetition of prolix masculine authority but also 
  through its internal and off-rhyme (words/affords, verse/prose, effete/repeat) 
  and abjuration of conventional notions of “ecstasy.”  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            This poetic rumination on a “Bible class” 
  is a notably odd Modernist moment.  But in effect, Moore posits her own revised 
  relation to masculine poetic tradition on a par with Pound’s and Eliot’s poetic 
  individualism (Slatin 30).  As Habakkuk’s name signifies, the poem replaces 
  classical with Judeo-Christian tradition.  “Of the prophet Habakkuk,” we are 
  told in Moore’s source, “we know nothing that is personal save his name,” which 
  is unusual even in Hebrew—an intensive form of a root meaning “to caress or 
  embrace.”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"
title=""><span> [11] </span></a>  Jerome, a note further tells us, suggested that 
  Habakkuk was “called ‘embrace’ either because of his love to the Lord, or because 
  he wrestles with God.”  Luther suggested that “Habakkuk means one who comforts 
  and holds up his people as one embraces a weeping person” (129).  Habakkuk was 
  the earliest of a new school of religion in Israel, and was an atypical “prophet,” 
  for unlike the other prophets, who addressed Israel on behalf of God, Habakkuk 
  was a skeptic who addressed God on behalf of Israel.  Moore’s other quotations 
  from <i>The Book of the Twelve</i> in her reading diary note that the Hebrew 
  ecstatics were not selfish (unlike modern Christian fanatics); that they were 
  “in sympathy with their nation’s aspirations for freedom and her whole political 
  life” (vol. 1, 25); and that the “age was very modern”—noted for its joy, energy, 
  patriotism, devoutness, and “cruel wealth.”<a
href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span> [12] </span></a>  Writing during 
  the First World War (but before the United States entered it), Moore must have 
  contemplated the analogies between the tumultuous age that produced the Old 
  Testament prophets and her own—even, perhaps, between Habakkuk and herself.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span> 
  [13] </span></a>  In reverting to “Habakkuk” because “external action is effete,” 
  then, she openly, if discreetly, declares that an expedient form for action 
  is poetry and the ecstasy that informs her work a reversion of Old Testament 
  skepticism, which serves as an analogue of her very individual embodiment of 
  an ethical poet-prophet. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Like Moore’s modernism, Alice Fulton’s 
  postmodernist poetic project resists a poetry comprised of particular (often 
  exclusively personal and narrative) details, as well as the lyric engagement 
  of only those emotions deemed appropriate by mainstream poetics.  For Fulton, 
  the problematic is that there are so few emotions represented in the lyric that 
  it has narrowed the range of the possible.  Desire and grief have long since 
  “consolidated into genre” (<i>Feeling</i> 300); ordinary language is uncritically 
  prized as a symptom of “sincerity”; linguistic play—a central aspect of poetry, 
  at least in English poetry since the Old English riddles—is considered florid 
  and insincere (and sometimes hysterically overwrought).  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:200%'><span>            </span>What 
  both of these poets implicitly call for is a less visually, formally, and thematically 
  stabilized poetry—a poetry that is on the verge or at the edge, one that does 
  play tennis without the net (and out of bounds to boot!).  Fulton has termed 
  the kind of poetry she has in mind fractal verse,<span style='font-style:normal'> 
  after the term that mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot used (from the Latin </span>fractus: 
  “irregular or fragmented”) for structures of natural turbulence previously thought 
  to be chaotic.  Mandelbrot discovered the deep patterns or logic (see Feeling 
  62-63, passim) of roots and leaves, for example, or clouds or arteries.<a href="#_edn14"
name="_ednref14" title=""><span> [14] </span></a>  Fulton is interested in a poetry 
  open to the fluctuations of consciousness, mindfulness, openheartedness.  She 
  describes it as being cast in “that point of metamorphosis, when structure is 
  incipient, all threshold, a neither-nor” (Feeling <span
style='font-style:normal'>63), and as having a sense of the nonbinarizing, the 
  peripheral that Lynn Keller has called, following Fulton herself, the “</span>then 
  some inbetween.”<a
href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span> [15] </span></a>  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:
200%'>Here, in that place of edges, doorways, and openings, just as the old identity 
  has been dropped but before the new one has been taken on, we find a maximalist 
  poetics of liminality (in Victor Turner’s sense of the creative betwixt-and-between 
  of culturally organized categories) capable of engaging the reader in less emotionally 
  predictable ways.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span> [16] </span></a>  
  Fulton explains:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>I’m interested in poems that engage with those untoward 
  emotions, going off the given emotional scripts to write the peripheral and 
  unvisited.  Such poetry will disappoint the genteel expectations of genre, but 
  it stands a chance of surprising me into feeling.<span style='font-style:
normal'> (</span>Feeling <span style='font-style:normal'>300; emphasis added)</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-style:normal'>For Fulton, the most interesting poetry engages a reader’s 
  mind with </span>something-larger-than the self.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Like Moore’s, Fulton’s poetry is distinguished by 
  its eclectic and flexible linguistic innovation and, Emily Grosholz argues, 
  its negotiation of, attendance to, the demands of accessibility (213).<a href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title=""><span> [17] </span></a>  To this assertion, however, 
  I want to add the caveat that, as with her great precursor, Fulton has never 
  let the “demands of accessibility”—as much a contested issue in current poetics 
  as it was in Moore’s day (see Keller 311-14, <i>passim</i>)—constrain or determine 
  the formal and contextual explorations in her work.  That is because, Fulton 
  argues, so much of the poetry which attends to those demands is not, in practice, 
  concerned with substantive issues—“conscience, responsibility, power, cruelty, 
  or <i>form</i>”— but is relentless in its concern with the self.  Its investigations 
  are not ontological, epistemological, or ethical, but “solipsistic” (<i>Feeling 
  </i>282).  She asks exasperatedly, <i>Can we talk about something else</i> (i.e. 
  than the self)? (<i>Feeling</i> 303).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>As a self-identified feminist, postmodern poet, one 
  who, from the first, has been as theoretically astute as the Language poets, 
  Fulton has explored multiple (re)constructions of the lyric subject, disengendering 
  as well as regendering it.  In doing so, she both attends to the personal and 
  opens her work to that which lies outside the individual (Miller 319).<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"
title=""><span> [18] </span></a>  She is interested in an exploratory inquiry 
  that will discomfit readers and unsettle their expectations, a poetry of <i>inconvenient</i> 
  knowledge (the title of one of her most important essays).  She favors the eccentric, 
  calls for a maximalist poetry of “odd, postmodern rapture” (akin to that Moorean 
  ecstasy of the “sort of heightened consciousness”)—that is, a formal excess 
  and emotive content which will unhinge foundational assumptions (<i>Feeling 
  </i>302). </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I want now to turn to a specific example in Fulton’s 
  recent collection, <i>Felt</i>, the title of which obviously functions symbolically 
  as both noun (the fabric) and verb (the past tense of <i>feel</i>).  In a poem 
  that takes up this symbolic potential, “Fair Use,” Fulton describes how the 
  fabric felt is made (“by pressing/ fibers till they can’t be wrenched apart” 
  [<i>Felt</i> 17]).<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span> [19] </span></a>  
  Although I have quoted the passage separately, lifted it out as I might a piece 
  of the fabric so that you can see how it feels, it cannot really be taken out 
  of its context without skewing the sense of Fulton’s methodology.  Here’s the 
  passage reconstituted:</p>
<p>As for the sofa, its fabric is vermiculite,</p>
<p>glittering, as is trans-</p>
<p>ferment.  My head’s already in its sixties flip.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s already dead.  Incandescence</p>
<p>has a heavy hand.  For all I care,</p>
<p>the TV might be an airshaft</p>
<p>            when the statics of <i>is</i> widen and show everyone</p>
<p>            meshed, a fabric of entanglement = =</p>
<p>            my consciousness felted with yours,</p>
<p>            although I didn’t know you then.</p>
<p>            </p>
<p>It is not metaphorical, the giver is</p>
<p>            literal beyond prediction about this:</p>
<p>            what happens to others happens to me.</p>
<p>            What joy, what sad.  As felt</p>
<p>is formed by pressing </p>
<p>fibers till they can’t be wrenched apart,</p>
<p>nothing is separate, the entire planet</p>
<p>being an unexpected example.</p>
<p>Is this fair use, to find</p>
<p>            the intergown of difference</p>
<p>            severing self from = = nonself = = gone.</p>
<p>            . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>            What lowercase god sent this</p>
<p>            = = immersion = =</p>
<p>            to test my radiance threshold?</p>
<p>            From then till never = = time, space, gravity</p>
<p>            felted to a single entity[.]</p>
<p>                                                (<i>Felt</i> 17-18)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>This is a poem that posits the insight that we are 
  all interconnected on this planet, and moves into a contemplation of our capacity 
  to feel others’ feelings: a sense of having “interfelt,” as the poem puts it 
  towards the end.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The poem opens in apparent <i>in media res </i>(“As 
  for the sofa…”) but never fastens upon a story line.  The personal and historical 
  details (“My head’s already in its sixties flip,/ Kennedy’s already dead”) locate 
  us chronologically but not purposefully (as in: developing the movement that 
  the opening lines trigger).  The first indented section (“when the statics of 
  <i>is</i> widen . . .”) substantively widens the poem, which becomes suddenly—coinciding 
  with the indentation—an ontological contemplation.  The poem then shifts abruptly 
  into analogy and neologistic pun (“my consciousness <i>felted</i> with yours”).  
  Then, with the move back to flush left, it shifts to definition (“As felt// 
  is formed by pressing/ fibers till they can’t be wrenched apart”) felted (as 
  it were) with extended metaphor.  As fabric and as sign registering an emotional 
  experience, the word <i>felt</i> is posited, through the flux of the poem’s 
  shifting focus, as both the ground and figure for the transcendent epiphany 
  at the heart of this poem (“nothing is separate, the entire planet”).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>As a fabric formed by “pressing/ fibers till they 
  can’t be wrenched apart,” felt is a seeming but complex image expressed in an 
  unseemly—even violent—language (the violence latent in <i>wrenched</i>, for 
  example).   The poem, too, is a complex of affective forces.  Formally, it foregrounds 
  its seams (“a fabric of entanglement = =”).  Thematically, it renders an insight—that 
  “nothing is separate, the entire planet”—wherein science (specifically the Gaia 
  hypothesis that we live in a living world in which we are all interconnected) 
  and spirituality (specifically Buddhism) meet.  Thus, as Fulton might explain, 
  the poem’s complexity happens at the level of lining as well as line.  To give 
  a few examples: </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>·</span> The word <i>felt</i> morphs from verb 
  to noun over the course of an enjambed stanza break (“What joy, what sad.  As 
  felt// is formed…); </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span>·</span> later in the poem Fulton employs a 
  neologism, <i>interfelt</i>, for the kind of entanglement of hearts that she 
  both thematically resists (“students = = teachers = = parents = = children = 
  =/ get your hearts out of mine” [<i>Felt </i>19] and formally contemplates; 
</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span>·</span> and this is akin to that moment of graphic 
  severing = = and = = connection accomplished by Fulton’s innovative use of the 
  double equal sign (much like Emily Dickinson’s use of the dash, of course—“severing 
  self from = = nonself”— as well as A.R. Ammons democratizing use of the colon).  
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>In other words, the poem is formally structured by 
  a series of scenic, substantive, and typographic confluences, meeting-places 
  (for the personal and historical, for example, or the scientific and spiritual, 
  among others), enacting what Fulton terms “the content of form” (<i>Feeling 
  </i>69).  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The stays of abstraction that underpin this poem— 
  “transferment” = = “incandescence” = = “consciousness” = = “immersion” = = “radiance” 
  = = “synthesis”</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'> = = “interfelt” = = “thousandfold” = = “hearts”—form 
  the dense, emotional texture of  epiphany at the poem’s heart.  As Ostriker 
  remarks of the engaged and ritual poetry that  “suggests nonoppressive models 
  of the conjunction between religion and politics, usually by re-imaging the 
  sacred as immanent rather than transcendent,” there is no transcendence in this 
  poem.  Rather, here Fulton’s poetry echoes Moore’s in its contemplation of the 
  value of immersion, saturation—<i>excess of feeling.  </i> I want to suggest 
  that this excess is associated with Fulton’s ethical sense of <i>compassion</i>.  
  As she construes this notion central to Buddhism, compassion is that communal 
  capacity to feel <i>with</i> rather than the distancing effect of feeling <i>for—</i>a 
  sympathy often mouthed but hardly felt in American culture (although it seems 
  clear that September 11<sup>th</sup> has changed that fact).  Instead of the 
  self-delusions of sympathy, the poem enjoins us through its mindfulness, its 
  mindful contemplation of vertiginously swift shifts, to immerse ourselves, to 
  risk the too-muchness of others’ feelings, from which we ordinarily—unmindfully—try 
  to protect ourselves.  To let the world in, close the distance, lower the veil 
  that separates “self from = = nonself”: to <i>interfeel.</i>   </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I’d like to close by turning briefly to Alicia Ostriker, 
  who has become, as Fulton’s poem allows us to see, a poet who risks the too-muchness 
  of others’ feelings.  In the essay “‘Howl’ Revisited: the Poet as Jew,” Ostriker 
  contends that Alan Ginsberg’s Jewishness was at least as crucial to his poetics 
  as Buddhism:</p>
<p>There is a word in Hebrew for a virtue at the core of Ginsberg’s character 
  and his writing, a virtue that has been noticed by infinite numbers of people—<i>chesed</i>.  
  It means kindness, or lovingkindness.  (103)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Because of the thoroughness of her study of Judaism, 
  Ostriker is able persuasively to contextualize what others have noticed and 
  attributed solely to Ginsberg’s Buddhism.  She then goes on to link his work’s 
  commentary on America to the role of “prophet” (as in Old Testament Hebrew prophecy).  
  She contends that no full understanding of Ginsberg’s tragicomic sensibility—the 
  link between The Book of Lamentations and “Howl,” to take a specific example—is 
  possible without taking into account Ginsberg’s formative Jewishness. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>            I would say, of course, that we may not 
  only see from her commentary useful connections to Moore’s public persona, but 
  also to Ostriker’s own work as a revisionary Jewish, feminist poet.  In Ostriker’s 
  case, the later poetry especially is complicated and deepened by the methodology 
  of midrashic collage and the ethics of <i>chesed</i>, of “lovingkindness,” which 
  permeate the vision central to her oeuvre.   In her moving poem “The Class,” 
  Ostriker assembles into the overarching narrative of the teacher’s compassion 
  for her students her students’ own words, multiplying the perspectives in the 
  poem so that, like a prism fracturing light into a spectrum, the poem contains 
  the comic as well as tragic:</p>
<p>            We say things in this class.  Like why it hurts.</p>
<p>            ………………</p>
<p>            The teacher hears tales from the combat zone</p>
<p>            Where the children live . . . . .</p>
<p>                                                Like all draftees,</p>
<p>            They have one job, survival,</p>
<p>            And permit themselves some jokes.</p>
<p>            <i>Like my father hits the bottle . . .</i></p>
<p><i>            And my mother.  </i>[And]</p>
<p>              ……………………………</p>
<p>            The homosexual drummer tapping out</p>
<p>            A knee tune, wagging his Groucho brows.</p>
<p>            <i>Hey, you ought to meet my mom real soon.</i></p>
<p><i>            ‘Cause when I tell her, she’s gonna die. </i>(194)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The teacher hears the students’ “common stories” (the 
  choice of common both precisely descriptive and ironic) of surviving incest, 
  rape, abuse of all sorts, attempted suicide, and knows that, in challenging 
  her students to “Write what makes you afraid to write,” she “helps them descend 
  into hell” (<i>The Little Space</i> 195).  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>This surprising counsel is, as it turns out, because 
  what she knows from her experience of giving permission, in the space of the 
  classroom, for her students “To gather pain into language” is that:</p>
<p class=MsoEndnoteText><span>            </span>The critics are wrong, the other 
  professors are wrong</p>
<p>            Who describe an art divisible from dirt,</p>
<p>            From rotten life.  (195)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Rather than submit finally and absolutely to despair 
  over art’s powerlessness in the face of horror, which can render the pain unsurvivable 
  (as it was for the subject of Adorno’s contemplation, Paul Celan, as Ostriker 
  well understands), she insists on the relevance, the connection of art to all 
  with which “dirt” is metonymically associated.  Poets confronting all to which 
  “rotten life” refers, Ostriker suggests in a recent essay, might contemplate 
  a line from the Talmudic <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>: “It is not incumbent 
  on you to finish the task.  Neither are you free to give it up” (“Beyond Confession” 
  35).  Adorno himself, we might recall, admitted the necessity of what we now 
  term a poetry of witness.  He wrote in <i>Negative Dialectics:</i> </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'>Perennial suffering has 
  as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream, hence it may have 
  been wrong to say that after Auschwitz you could no longer write poems.  But 
  it is not wrong to raise the less cultural question whether after Auschwitz 
  you can go on living.  (362-63)<a
href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span> [20] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>As a critic, Ostriker advocates and herself writes 
  as a poet a poetry that has an “intensely engaged and engaging” speaking subject.  
  Like Ginsberg (and Moore in her later years,), Ostriker favors a performative, 
  ritual poetry in which:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'>The poet . . .enacts a bardic, 
  shamaness’ or priestess’ role, enacting a modern version of the theme of transformation 
  common to tribal ceremonies in ancient Europe, Britain, America, and Africa. 
  . . . For poet and reader-participant alike, ritual poetry implies the possibility 
  of healing alternatives to dominance-submission scenarios.  It suggests nonoppressive 
  models of the conjunction between religion and politics, usually by re-imaging 
  the sacred as immanent rather than transcendent, by defining its audience as 
  members of a potentially strong community[.] (16-17)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>To write a defense of poetry by excavating its archaic 
  function, Ostriker articulates a position located at the juncture of the political 
  and the spiritual, that is both ethical and revolutionary.  It is an astonishingly 
  romantic stance for a major poet-critic at the beginning of the twenty-first 
  century.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            But, you may recall, Kristeva also theorizes 
  the importance of the subject position in poetry: its capacity to dissolve narcissistic 
  fixations, its association with social practices that destabilize social structures 
  and the privileging of the privileged—esoterism, shamanism, and carnival, for 
  example—because like them, she argues, poetry’s language demystifies the unifying 
  operations of the symbolic. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>            Artist and activist Suzi Gablik contends 
  that the artistic process of dissolving ego-boundaries poses a visionary response 
  to what she calls the “modern challenge”:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal;'>To find sacredness within 
  the world, to recover our lost souls, to somehow get past what George Steiner 
  recently described as “the age of embarrassment about God, about the numinous, 
  the collective unconsciousness; embarrassment about owning to our inner world, 
  transcendental experience, mysteries, and magnanimities.”  (quoted. in Gablik 
  at 53)</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Gablik suggests, in <i>The Reenchantment of Art,</i> 
  that the ethical aspect of the artistic practice might be usefully termed reconstructive 
  (rather than revolutionary), concerned as it is with ways of changing our minds, 
  our mindsets, our socialization into, our complicity with, oppression (Gablik 
  17)—and after last week’s horrific act, I want to add: with violence.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>To return in closing to Ostriker’s poem “The Class,” 
  what the teacher sees and hears—what, as Ostriker (following Rukeyser and Carolyn 
  Forché) terms a poetics of <i>witness</i>—generates the poem.  But it is what 
  she is portrayed as believing—and this teacher is paradigmatic for the ethical 
  vision of the prophet-poet Ostriker envisions—is that against all evidence “Poetry 
  heals, or redeems suffering,/ If we can enter its house of judgment” (to believe 
  ourselves, we might recall Moore’s line: <i>it is enough if present faith mend 
  partial proof</i>).  Whose suffering does poetry redeem and whom does it heal?  
  If not the poet herself, the teacher thinks, perhaps a reader years later, for:  
  “<i>Great is truth</i>,” she tells herself, <i>“and mighty above all things”</i> 
  (195).  She cannot say this in her class, for the students would think her dotty, 
  of course.  What she can quietly give them in the position that she occupies 
  is <i>chesed</i>, “lovingkindness,” the strand of which is one thread running 
  through the midrashic narrative.  Years later, one of her students may read 
  the poem, and themselves be in a position to pass on the vision.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I am not suggesting that any of these poets call for 
  a larger systemic change, though it’s arguable.  Rather, I contend that these 
  poets ethically, spiritually explore in their work what is possible at the individual 
  level, where we have subjective agency and can effect change—if <i>only </i>a 
  change of heart.  As Moore put it in “In Distrust of Merits,” lines that resonate 
  eerily for me as the nation responds to the September 11th terrorist attack: 
  “We/ vow, we make this promise//to the fighting—it’s a promise—‘We’ll/ never 
  hate black, white, red, yellow, Jew,/ Gentile, <i>Muslim</i>”: “There never 
  was a war that was/ not inward; I must/ fight till I have conquered in myself 
  what/ causes war” (<i>CP</i> 137-38).</p>
