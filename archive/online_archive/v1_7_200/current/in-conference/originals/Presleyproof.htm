<h1 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>September 
  11: A View from London</span></h1>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Frances Presley</span></b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>In this short discussion I want to examine some of 
  the wider issues raised by <i>How2</i> contributors and others, in response 
  to the terrorist attacks of September 11.  I’ve also embarked on a new piece 
  of writing which is a response to the aftermath of September 11, but in terms 
  of London’s particular history.  The impact of the IRA bombing in the last twenty 
  years is clearly essential to it.   I’m approaching the text through collaboration 
  with a musician, and it is driven by experiments in sound and form as much as 
  by recent events.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><span lang=EN-GB>The symbol as trump?</span></b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The initial focus of London’s reaction to the assault 
  on the twin towers was fear in the City.  On the news we were shown pictures 
  of workers in the City watching the images on television in bars, workers who 
  had been told to leave their buildings.  As I wrote in my postcard, the City 
  was evacuated.  The City in London means above all the stock exchange, and an 
  undemocratically governed area of London which has jurisdiction and powers far 
  beyond its boundaries.      </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The financial towers of the City were targets for 
  the IRA long before Islamic fundamentalists set out for the twin towers.  Scenes 
  of destruction at the Stock Exchange in the early 90s were compared to the Blitz, 
  with their falling glass and twisted metal.  These towers were a potent symbol 
  for the terrorists. As Lorraine Daston wrote in the <i>London Review of Books</i>: 
  “If the symbolic had not been trump, the pilots of the hijacked planes would 
  have aimed straight for a nuclear power plant, with which they could have wreaked 
  still more horror.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  Although you could argue that a nuclear power 
  plant would have entailed too much mass destruction even for the hijackers.  
  I’m not sure either if I entirely agree with her conclusion, but it is interesting: 
  “If there really is to be something like a war on terrorism, then the new challenge 
  seems to be addressed to anthropologists and historians, sociologists and theologians, 
  students of the symbolic rather than the technical.”   It’s also interesting 
  that she doesn’t mention poets!  As a consequence of September 11 the towers 
  also became unavoidable symbols for us, even appearing in our dreams.  It is 
  a symbol that we need to reclaim from the financiers and the killers.  We will 
  probably also need to reclaim it from some of the professionals listed by Daston.  
  I have already seen an example of crude psychoanalytic interpretation.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I found myself turning to the language of fairytale 
  and legend.  It seemed as though we were all captives of the tower, locked up 
  by wicked stepmothers or fathers.  As Marina Warner says: “fairytale… reveals 
  how human behaviour is embedded in material circumstance.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a> My own new/ old fairytale was also a saint’s tale.  The image 
  of the tower brought to my mind one of the mediaeval rood paintings which survived 
  the reformation (those Puritan fundamentalists) at Ranworth church in Norfolk.  
  This was a defaced depiction of Saint Barbara, locked in a tower by her wicked 
  father for refusing to renounce Christianity or marry the man of his choice. 
  Disobedience is her most attractive characteristic as a saint.  She features 
  in Christine de Pizan’s <i>City of Ladies</i>, and she also became the patron 
  saint (no longer recognised by the Catholic church) of, amongst others, “architects, 
  bomb technicians, construction workers, dying people, firefighters…”  It seemed 
  to be the connection with architects that was selected at Ranworth church, and 
  it was through an understanding of architecture that I felt she was most likely 
  to make her escape. For me, this would be the open architecture of the poem, 
  with Barbara as its initial, unstable metaphor.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>This architecture exists both in the form and meaning 
  of the poem.  For example, there are different ‘floors’ or sections, divided 
  by suspension points, chevrons or arrows.  At times I use the layout of the 
  poem to convey the empty spaces left by the IRA bomb craters, or the ambiguous 
  extension of new scaffolding.  The most intense and difficult sections of the 
  poem, and those which are closest to the events of September 11, were also the 
  most improvised.  I tried to empty my mind, and allow the words and their space 
  to take shape, sometimes through a simultaneous collaboration with musical improvisation. 
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>I also want to consider the kind of official counter 
  symbols I was aware of in the shadow of American flag waving.   Obviously things 
  are very different here—we haven’t had to suffer the same call to patriotism, 
  and the flag has had little significance in this country for some time, except 
  for football fans, fashion designers and Northern Irish Unionists.  I say the 
  flag, rather than the Union Jack, because increasingly, with devolution, the 
  main flag wavers—football fans, have adopted the flag of Saint George.  There 
  are all kinds of ugly nationalisms that can and occasionally do rear their head 
  here, but people are wary of calls to patriotism. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>There have been attempts to commemorate the victims 
  in some way or other, and I became interested in the symbol of the commemorative 
  plaque, as an official counter symbol to mass destruction, and a way of expressing 
  communal grief.  Not long after September 11, I caught a local news item in 
  which it was suggested that there should be a plaque for those who had died 
  in New York in the proposed new Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.  This centre 
  is on the site of St Ethelburga’s church, near the Baltic Exchange, which was 
  bombed by the IRA in 1993.  They asked people in the street what they thought 
  of the idea, and got a mixed reaction.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Plaques are a discreet way of establishing a public 
  memorial, and it’s interesting that public memorials are increasingly minimalist.  
  I have my doubts even about plaques, including those I have given support to, 
  indeed about any excess of symbolism, and when I took part in the unveiling 
  of a plaque for H.D. at 44 Mecklenburgh Square, I wrote afterwards:</p>
<p class=MsoBlockText>She is not the plaque.  It is not her name.  They will not 
  find her wherever they look, nor can she be invented.  /deep in the sea, broken 
  at bulkhead 35.  No one can breathe here, in the smog of Bloomsbury, in these 
  dark narrow spaces.  We know that they will be separated and write letters.  
  She will even try to write a conventional narrative.  The house is dying into 
  its history and its damp patches. We will always see the plaque as we cycle 
  through the Square, looking up at the nothing, the thing (rem), on the last 
  wall of the house.  We will move more slowly, until its blue light returns us 
  to our usual time, and we spin out. Hard disk, she said, I thought it was.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Andrea Brady’s talk at Birkbeck College, “100 Days, 
  poetic pathos and political apathy” is also relevant here.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  She has researched 17<sup>th</sup> century grief, 
  elegies and commemoration as well as the manufacture of public mourning.  She 
  looks at how the mortuary rituals, which were traditionally communal and smoothed 
  the transition of power, have become in our individualistic society an abyss 
  of incalculable loss, in which we celebrate private individuals. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>An exception to this is the deaths of the New York 
  fire officers, which represents “a tribute to the absolute of the service economy”.  
  This tribute is in a society which largely ignores the ideal of public service.  
  I remember how I cried for the courage of the firemen as they rescued the Thatcher 
  government after the IRA had bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton: “They are lowering 
  him down, they are lowering down Mr Tebbit on a stretcher.”  Norman Tebbit was 
  the minister once described as a semi-domesticated polecat.  I also remember 
  attending support meetings for the firemen’s union in the last days before Thatcher 
  came to power, and famously declared that there was no such thing as society.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Brady also accepts the funerals of President Kennedy 
  and Princess Diana, in our present day society, as being emblematic rather than 
  privatised.  I’m not sure that I would wish for a return to emblematic funerals 
  of that kind.  Certainly the death of Diana invoked a mass hysteria of misplaced 
  grief, manufactured by the media.  She was Media or Medea, if it had not been 
  a soap opera.  It was so difficult that I remember going into work and having 
  to be very careful what I said and to whom.  No doubt a similar kind of censorship 
  currently exists in the States.</p>
<h1 style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>A language of feelings?</span></h1>
<p style='line-height:200%'>It seems to me that we do need a language for feelings, 
  including bereavement, and that we cannot just leave that sort of thing to religious 
  texts and greetings card verse.   Andrea Brady convincingly writes about how 
  the politicians pervert the language of bereavement, and use their supposed 
  commitment to the sanctity of individual life as an excuse for waging imperialist 
  war.  She actually uses the phrase “imperialist trump,” and I’m interested by 
  this repetition of the word “trump,” as it suggests both triumphalism and our 
  fear of it.  Is this perversion of individual mourning trump, as Brady suggests, 
  or are there alternatives?  This is an issue that I touched on earlier in a 
  Postcard about the recent Laurie Anderson concert, in response to an unexpected 
  rendition of her ‘greatest hit’, “O Superman.”  In particular it contains the 
  messages on the answer phone from mom: “Is anybody there?  Are you coming home?”  
  I saw the news reports in which people played back the last answer phone messages 
  from those they loved.  And I was suddenly in tears because my own mother had 
  died since I first heard “O Superman”, and she used to leave messages on my 
  answer phone, which she would often end “Love, mum.”  There is, of course, a 
  deep irony in Anderson’s song and especially in the dying cadence of “When justice 
  has gone there’s always mom.”  Anderson implies and this quotation from Catherine 
  Lutz and Lila Abu-Lughod asks: “whether the proliferation of emotion discourse 
  in American life… provide(s) an idiom for asserting the existence of bonds between 
  people in the face of the actual attenuation of such bonds.” <a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a> And yet we still need to write 
  about these bonds of love.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Brady also implies that all expression of feeling 
  is liable to be exploited by right wing media and government: “the reduction 
  of political motivation to feelings, like maternal care, and political thinking 
  to intuition, effectively restricts the political imaginary to local amelioration.”  
  Evidently this is true, if political motivation is really reduced to the feelings 
  of clichéd sentiment. However, it seems to me that feelings do play an important 
  role both in our local communities, and also in the wider political struggles. 
  I certainly detect passion in Brady’s writing.  I’m thinking also of some of 
  the anti-racist struggles in this country I have been involved in, which could 
  only be sustained through strength of feeling, “fire in the belly,” as well 
  as cool understanding.  </p>
<h1 style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>The avant-garde poetic </span></h1>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Linda Russo’s point that “to be human and male is 
  to write Poetry; to be female is talk and to grieve” holds true in England as 
  in America.  We even have a male poet laureate for such occasions.  It seemed 
  hardly less true of the avant-garde when at a large benefit performance held 
  in London there were very few women performers.  </p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>The avant-garde of its nature suggests 
  a male militaristic activity, and historically has tended to exclude women even 
  more than its conservative counterparts.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>The architecture of the poetic sequence I am writing 
  is by no means a traditional narrative or even a reworking of the fairytale 
  or legend.  Although in the immediate aftermath of the attack I felt reduced 
  to linear prose, and the kind of journalistic account I was reading everyday 
  in the papers, this was replaced by the beginning of the new collaboration in 
  early November.  Moreover, my initial account in <i>How2</i> postcards was intended 
  as a way of describing not just my own situation, but more importantly addressing 
  the situation of the communities I care about.  Arielle Greenberg asked how 
  it was possible to be “a non-narrative poet in the face of such REAL, linear 
  surreality”.  It is possible, in fact it is necessary, as I discovered when 
  my mother died unexpectedly, but it does not happen immediately, and we continue 
  to write other kinds of discourse such as this one.  Let us not forget also, 
  speaking of surrealism, that André Breton’s fame was established more by his, 
  very accessible, prose works than his poetry.  Earlier, when I tried to unravel 
  the legend of Saint Barbara I came much closer to story telling than I do in 
  the poem.  Sometimes I use the words of those who have witnessed; though the 
  role of the listener is always significant.  The issue is not whether we do 
  or do not write non-linear poetry all the time, but how best to realise, in 
  all aspects of our lives, our desire for justice and love.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%'>Andrea Brady, critical of sentimentality, finds little 
  alternative, however, in formalist “language-centred” texts, which in her view 
  alienate any certainty of shared meaning.  She writes of “the endless deferral 
  of meaning (which) replicates our inability—or unwillingness—to encounter death”.  
  I can’t speak for the Language poets she criticises, though I can imagine the 
  kind of defence they might make.  I suspect that many would question the notion 
  of an endless deferral of meaning.  It is true that we struggle to share meaning 
  which is not prey to nationalism or easy sentimentality, but that does not mean 
  that it is endlessly deferred.  It is the struggle which defines both the form 
  and the meaning of our texts.</p>
