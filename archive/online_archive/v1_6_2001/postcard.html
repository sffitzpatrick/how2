          <b>...about Perdita</b><br>
          <br>
          I admired Perdita and she was my friend. Our relationship in New York 
          where we shared an apartment was harmonious. We were at times oddly 
          alike, having the same likes and dislikes, although she did prefer second-rate 
          novels. I believe it was a way of relaxing. Her children are consistent 
          readers. One could say it was a literary family.<br>
          <br>
          I shall continue to miss her. She possessed a sudden humor, unlike anyone 
          else I knew. She lived in a literary, sophisticated household in her 
          youth, and I benefited from being near her humor and her style. She 
          was a child of H.D. the poet and that says much. I read a book on the 
          history of music by her real father, Cecil Gray, and it is brilliant 
          and subtle. One always wonders how her life might have changed, had 
          her real father once appeared in her adulthood. She told me she &#147;once 
          saw her father walking on the beach on Capri, with a famous opera star, 
          pearls floating on his back.&quot;<br>

          Memories of Perdita</b><br>
          Reflections on Perdita Schaffner [Excerpted from a letter written for

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">March 22, 2002<br>
          <br>
          ...Your mother's picture hangs on the bulletin board above my computer.... 
          She is standing in a turquoise smock, her gentle eyes wrinkled in shy 
          smiles.... Her kindness shines out of that photograph. Somehow I believed 
          that she would be there forever, bemused and tolerant guardian of all 
          of us many people who poured over her mother's life and work, inspired 
          and curious and moved and forever fascinated. <br>
          <br>
          ...I thought I&#146;d share my memory of my first meeting with your 
          mother in 1978, around the time of the first screening of Borderline 
          in New York City, an event held in conjunction with the celebration 
          of Paul Robeson&#146;s life. I met her first at the reception and then 
          later in more relaxed surroundings in the old brownstone. It was not 
          too long after the death of Norman Pearson and her decision to take 
          on the heavy and all so very public responsibilities of being her mother&#146;s 
          literary executor. At the reception, she looked somehow ravaged, as 
          if the public assumption of the role of being &#147;H.D.&#146;s daughter&#148; 
          was more than she wanted to bear. She was stiff and quiet and almost 
          speechless standing next to your father and maybe even some of you children.... 
          <br>
          <br>
          People milled and streamed about and there she was in the middle of 
          it all, so very publicly &#147;the daughter&#148; alongside Robeson&#146;s 
          &#147;son&#148;.... I was enthralled and even more shy than she to meet 
          her. She kindly told me to come by to see her the next day for an &#147;interview.&#148; 
          THAT was surely intimidating, though she herself didn&#146;t intimidate. 
          She looked too unhappy and uncertain to terrify even a young uncertain 
          scholar like me.<br>
          <br>
          The next day I dutifully appeared on the doorstep, where she set me 
          at ease immediately in a comfy, homey environment, where the somewhat 
          worn furniture and informal signs of family life everywhere told a story 
          of resistance to upper crust displays of status and connection. She 
          eyed me curiously, taking her new responsibility seriously. Suddenly, 
          I realized I was to be evaluated, looked over, sized-up&#151;perhaps 
          dumped or denied access to H.D.&#146;s &#147;shelf&#148; at the Beinecke. 
          Would I know enough? Would I say something stupid about H.D. and not 
          pass muster? Would I offend with my questions? Would she want to shape 
          what I wrote? Give me some kind of litmus test before giving permission? 
          Suddenly, she was a very new factor in the just emerging world of H.D. 
          studies. And I was very afraid&#151;terrified.<br>
          <br>
          Your mother&#146;s first questions were about my children, then 4 and 
          7 years of age. &#147;What are their names?&#148; she asked. I said, 
          Ruth and Joanna. She sighed and said, &#147;How nice. How ordinary. 
          What nice ordinary names.&#148; She told me your names&#151;Valentine, 
          Nicholas, Elizabeth, and Timothy. And she said that it was very important 
          that I understand that her mother had never stood at the kitchen counter 
          making peanut butter sandwiches for her daughter. That she, Perdita, 
          never had other companions to play with; that she, Perdita, was forbidden 
          school and schoolmates. She said to never forget that H.D. loved the 
          idea of motherhood more than she could bear the messiness of it all. 
          I could sense her quiet defiance, her determination to create a home 
          for her four children that would be more ordinary, more filled with 
          friends and peanut butter sandwiches and station wagons and stories 
          about school. I imagine now that she would have been&#151;or at least 
          wanted to be&#151;the perfect &#147;soccer mom,&#148; driving you kids 
          here and there to this lesson and that lesson, this friend and that 
          friend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we settled into 
          the warm sofa with the fading brown cover&#151;I seem to see in my mind&#146;s 
          eye shades of brown and tan and fading green or blue&#151;with tea in 
          hand, she brought to life for me a childhood filled with melodrama, 
          with talented, driven, somewhat crazy <i>artistes</i> flying in and 
          out of rooms, slamming doors, staring moodily, fiercely private or intrusively 
          bossy&#151;all at Kenwin, the villa above the lake, a modern Bauhaus 
          where art was made. She&#151;the child&#151;never quite sure who would 
          be in her life or out of it at the next moment, didn&#146;t know what 
          the storms were all about, just that the storms blew her one way, then 
          the other. The alternative? Stuck at Audley House, stuck in white gloves 
          and rules rules rules. Shuttled from Kenwin to London, opposite lives. 
          And her two mothers&#151;the one, distant, adored, with not enough but 
          very precious moments shared with special intensity and privacy; the 
          other, fierce and domineering, the Steam Roller. She said &#147;My Two 
          Mothers.&#148; She said &#147;They were Platonic lesbians.&#148; It 
          took me many years to understand the wisdom of her seemingly casual 
          remarks.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">With her talk, 
          Perdita brought a world to life for me, perched me on the windowsill 
          of a world I could scarcely imagine by myself, no matter how much I 
          read in the still uncatalogued papers stored in the bowels of Beinecke, 
          waiting for the meticulous and inspired and tender curation of Louis 
          Silverstein. What a gift&#151;her gift! One of her many gifts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I flew out of that 
          brownstone sensing that Perdita would be behind me, standing in the 
          wings of what I wrote and trying to understand, never a censoring spirit, 
          but a bemused one nonetheless. As time passed, she assumed the public 
          mantle of H.D.&#146;s daughter with great dignity and generosity, growing 
          into it, having the wisdom to let a hundred flowers bloom, let anyone 
          have access, let anyone say what they would say or write what they would 
          write. Wrongheaded? So what. Stupid? So what. Off on cloud nine? So 
          what. Incomprehensible? So what. Involved in its own world? So what. 
          But always, she gave permission. So often, she wrote kind notes, patient 
          with the excesses and enthusiasms of others.<br>
          <br>
          Her answers, criticisms, disagreements&#151;all came in the form of 
          the stunning essays. Her gift to bring us all through her words to that 
          time, that place, those people, herself in the center, never lost in 
          the shuffle. Her writing has the detail, the rootedness of Bryher; the 
          grace, rhythm, and insight of H.D.&#151;her two mothers braided into 
          a style uniquely her own. We all begged her to write more, and more. 
          Anything. She too is a writer among writers. She hinted she would, she 
          might, she was&#151;writing: then out would come into print another 
          gem, another pearl. Are there, were there, more? <br>
          <br>
          I feel bereft, as you all must, at her passing. I feel inconsolably 
          sad that when I&#146;d finally managed to finish the edition of H.D.&#146;s 
          and Bryher&#146;s letters about psychoanalysis...that she would not 
          see it...and daydream bemusedly and curiously about those lost times 
          and the people today who would read of them....<br>

          <b>PERDITA SCHAFFNER</b><br>
          (Eulogy delivered at the Bay Street Theater, March 31, 2002) <br>
          <br>
          My wife Paula and I first met Perdita and John Schaffner back in 1977 
          and were immediately charmed and intrigued by them, by Perdita's aura 
          of constant British amusement over and bemusement at a terminally insane 
          world and by John's more serious, somewhat regal sense of self and function. 
          Both were generous hosts in their different ways and gracious dinner 
          guests. At home, amid a pleasant shuffle of tall children grown up and 
          often going or coming, as amiable as their parents, Perdita was the 
          Lady of the Perpetual Meat Loaf, which she claimed to have shaped into 
          a delicious centerpiece from odds and ends found loitering in the fridge 
          or larder, even table scrapings, and John, encased in his loud All-American 
          chef&#146;s apron, presided over a metal basin of steaming clam shells 
          and other seashore salvage.<br>
          <br>
          I still treasure the visual impact of Perdita, the Dutch cap of black 
          hair, the quick, wise, almost childlike smile, the sudden wave of a 
          dismissive hand when a disdained name or subject (usually political) 
          came up in conversation, the general impression she gave of a convivial 
          benevolence&#151;fused with a deep-rooted shyness, arm frozen at the 
          ready to ward off surprise attacks, however clearly pleased to have 
          people enjoying her cat-patrolled house and grounds. It was easy to 
          see how her tall, self-assured husband must have given her a necessary 
          sense of safety&#151;she told me on more than one occasion that she 
          liked the &quot;big bear&quot; aspect of my bulky presence (much bulkier 
          then, than now) when I showed up to take her back to our house for lunch 
          or dinner or when she joined us going to one of the inevitable and endless 
          Hampton lawn parties, poetry readings, gallery openings.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, I had known of Perdita before we met her, having done research 
          in areas of literary history that intersected with the career of her 
          mother, the poet H.D., who had given birth to her while in the throes 
          of double pneumonia. I was aware of the hectic household she grew up 
          in, dubbed &quot;the lump&quot; in her infancy by its melange of egocentric, 
          variously talented artist types as contemptuous of gender roles as of 
          bourgeois conformity, a household strange enough to make my own dysfunctional 
          nest appear semi-normal. And I marveled at her serene survival and major 
          achievements in subsequent life tasks, mastering three languages, serving 
          at Bletchley during the war, emigrating alone to America afterwards 
          to acquire a new citizenship, a literary agent husband, and four bright, 
          highly individual children. Fascinated from a biographer's perch, urging 
          her, like many others, to write an autobiography, I was curious about 
          the flesh and blood specifics of her rich past, which included a cast 
          of extraordinary characters that ranged from D. H. Lawrence (once suspected, 
          like Ezra Pound, of being her father) and Aldous Huxley to the outrageous 
          Sitwell clan.<br>
          <br>
          She did indeed try to preserve her past with the pen throughout the 
          1980's, taking workshops and turning out prefaces and brief memoirs 
          for reprints of her mother's books. It was in one such, a contribution 
          to Michael King's 1986 anthology, H.D.: Woman and Poet, that Perdita 
          confirmed the difficulty she faced as an author, recalling that her 
          two mothers (H.D. and her partner, Winifred Bryher) &quot;were writers, 
          which indeed I knew all along. . . . Maybe I'd become a writer too. 
          No. I couldn't compete.&quot; What she did write, however, was inevitably 
          deft and perceptive, if reticent in a shrewd minimalist fashion that 
          painted much more than was on the page, self-deprecatingly honest and 
          capable of a sly wit but forever tolerant of the foibles of her family 
          and other strangers.<br>
          <br>
          In her 1983 introduction to H.D.'s novel, Bid Me To Live, Perdita is 
          quite candid about her biological father, the composer Cecil Gray. Noting 
          that she had been legally adopted by the Macphersons in 1927 (Bryher 
          had wed Kenneth Macpherson after divorcing Robert McAlmon), she recounted 
          the sole meeting she had with Gray twenty years later, which passed 
          pleasantly without a single mention of their relationship. &quot;Let 
          sleeping dogs lie,&quot; was Perdita' s prescription for healing peace, 
          here and elsewhere. &quot;Don't disturb the profound animal.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Such a prescription, which comes at a high cost, to be sure, had its 
          origins in an ambivalence-shaken childhood, cradled in great wealth 
          but wracked by fierce contrary emotional winds. Perdita's &quot;Sketch 
          of H.D.: The Egyptian Cat,&quot; done in 1980 for the reissue of another 
          H.D. novel, Hedylus, gave the first of several capsule views of her 
          lonely early years: &quot;We lived in Switzerland . . . isolated from 
          the world. Visitors came by from time to time; mostly writers, adults 
          only. I never consorted with other children, other families, other mothers.&quot; 
          In the same memoir, H.D. is limned as &quot;a tall figure of striking 
          beauty ...and frequently overwrought, off in the clouds, or sequestered 
          in a room, not to be disturbed on any account.&quot; Later, happily, 
          according to Perdita's account, once free of &quot;the pressures and 
          conflicts of motherhood,&quot; H.D. &quot;became a much better mother. 
          . . . We were adults together, and friends. &quot; <br>
          <br>
          Yet the dolorous refrain haunting the prefaces and introductions Perdita 
          produced for her mother's reissued books was a dirge of sorts for a 
          childhood denied, as in the 1986 preamble to H.D.'s Nights that summons 
          up the imposing Bauhaus on Lake Geneva where she entered her painful 
          teens: &quot;We were terribly ingrown, a volatile microcosm in the vastness. 
          I was caught up in it, and trapped, yet an outsider, a gawky adolescent 
          without a clue as to what was going on. I missed a lot, but I will never 
          forget the tensions.&quot; Without a father, or too many of them, Perdita' 
          s core self split and reforged itself in the crucible of two contending, 
          if not antithetical, female forces: the adored rejecting poet goddess 
          and her earthbound opposite, the plain, blunt, kindly Bryher, rebelling 
          against her own distancing parents, avant-garde in her artistic sympathies 
          but common-sense firm in her nurturing practicality. Perdita's &quot;Pandora's 
          Box,&quot; written in 1981 to provenance her mother's HERmione&#151;Hermione 
          was, of course, mother to the charming Perdita in Shakespeare's Winter&#146;s 
          Tale&#151; Perdita articulates the anguish and outrage of every artist's 
          offspring ever forced to sit outside a closed door while her or his 
          parent is obsessively pursuing the Muse: &quot;Hush, Hush, whisper who 
          dares. 'Your mother is working.' In her room, behind a locked door. 
          . . . I wanted to be in that room. I resented being hauled away.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          It is here that Perdita dramatizes the pull of the female spirits that 
          would shape her into the human paradox she became: &quot;'Hippo, hippo,' 
          [Bryher] would yell, pursuing me with a hippo hide whip. And I was stood 
          in comers, and deprived of dessert, like any bad Victorian child. Well 
          warranted, I have no doubt. . . . In their different ways, both mothers 
          gave me a lot of affection. . . . I just never knew what was going to 
          happen next. &quot; The Perdita whom Paula and I met and came to cherish 
          seemed very much an amalgam of her two mothers, a lover of books and 
          literature, a fond mother and grandmother, a graceful survivor of the 
          natural disasters inflicted by irrational fate, including the death 
          of John in 1983 and her son Nicholas in 1991.<br>
          <br>
          The latter blow sought minor relief in yet another verbal cameo, this 
          one, &quot;His Mother's Tribute,&quot; appearing in Out of Season (1993), 
          Paula's anthology of pieces by and for people who died before their 
          time, and following several of Nicholas's own poems and Timothy's adroit 
          elegy for his brother. Again, brevity and the fertile unspoken prevail. 
          &quot;'Love you,' one of us would say, countered by 'I love you too' 
          by the other,&quot; is how she begins, going on to isolate his specialness: 
          &#147;not the oldest, not the youngest, not the girl&quot;&#151;and 
          to salute his dedication when critically ill at winter's start, keeping 
          &quot;hard at work with final revisions, proof corrections, captions&quot; 
          for his final book. The tribute ends as it begins, circling to the last 
          visit, &quot;'Love you,' I said at the door of his hospital room. 'Love 
          you too,' he replied with that wonderful smile.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          In retrospect, one can appreciate the heroic attempt to hang a full 
          portrait on a single peg, and the unbearable sadness of the tears that 
          always sear deepest and endure the longest, the unwept ones. Her consolation 
          in her last years, besides the evident joy in her grandchildren, Timothy's 
          sons, Wyatt and John, and Val's two girls, Kaya and Lia (Perdita died 
          before Pada's birth but knew he was on the way), was in accepting her 
          beacon-like place in her mother's lengthening public shadow: &quot;Late 
          in life,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I've come to a new career, or rather, 
          it has come to me: keeper of the flame, a daunting responsibility.&quot; 
          It was also a career she patently relished. I remember running across 
          her one winter in Houston, the odd venue for that year's annual MLA 
          Convention, and being warmed by the evident delight she took in the 
          session and panel devoted to her mother's work.<br>
          <br>
          One of Perdita' s finest literary miniatures is &quot;A Day at the St. 
          Regis with Dame Edith,&quot; which was published in the American Scholar 
          (1992) and recently reprinted in The Pushcart Book of Essays (2002). 
          It cleverly and with gentle humor depicts the extravagant behavior and 
          dress of Edith Sitwell on one of her rare visits to New York but pauses 
          amid the fun to observe with typical acuity: &quot;I realized how intensely 
          vulnerable she was, underneath the flamboyance, beyond her spectacular 
          fac&acirc;de.&quot; Like Perdita herself, no doubt, a vulnerability 
          I witnessed during my last glimpse of her on Main Street in East Hampton, 
          when I met her as she emerged from one of that avenue' s notoriously 
          overpriced boutiques. Some doubtless flippant remark of mine elicited 
          that trademark &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; that Cheshire smile and dismissive 
          wave of a hand as she waited to be helped into a car by the solicitous 
          Catherine, obviously enfeebled but still refusing to accept the brutally 
          unacceptable.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps the best manner in which to say goodbye to Perdita is to remember 
          the brilliant wood violets that spangle the Schaffner fields each year 
          and share the opening poem of H.D.'s 1921 collection, Hymen, which was 
          dedicated to Bryher and Perdita:<br>
          <br>
          They said: <br>
          she is high and far and blind<br>
          in her high pride, <br>
          but now that my head is bowed in sorrow, I find<br>
          she is most kind. <br>
          We have taken life, they said,<br>
          blithely, not groped in a mist<br>
          for things that are not&#151;<br>
          are, if you will, but bloodless&#151;<br>
          why ask happiness of the dead?<br>
          and my heart bled. <br>
          Ah, could they know <br>
          how violets throw strange fire,<br>
          red and purple and gold,<br>
          how they glow <br>
          gold and purple and red<br>
          where her feet tread.</o:p></font></p>

          The project</b><br>
          <br>
          Networking Women focuses on a number of women writers, intellectuals, 
          artists, and art patrons (among them Dora Marsden, Harriet Shaw Weaver, 
          Bryher, H. D., Edith Craig, Nancy Cunard, Margaret Anderson, Muriel 
          Rukeyser, Susan Glaspell, Katherine Mansfield, Una Marson, Tillie Olsen, 
          Meridel LeSueur, Elody Oblath Stuparich, Carlotta Kaderl Beck, Wanda 
          Wultz, Anita Pittoni) who have, through their different initiatives: 
          a) proposed, built, asserted an autonomous female subjectivity; b) radically 
          redefined male and female sexualities, the social roles of men and women, 
          and the changes in sexual relationships as a starting point for a modern 
          history and a new culture; c) worked for the emergence of a cross-ethnic, 
          international and supranational culture.<br>
          <br>
          Far from being considered as new pawns on the modernist checkerboard 
          or as exceptional personalities waiting to be canonized, they have been 
          studied in their roles as founders of magazines and journals, creators 
          of salons or theater groups, or as social and political activists. From 
          this perspective, they are links connecting and promoting a vast array 
          of human, political, cultural and literary relations. Their first rate 
          intellectual production, moreover, has constantly been related to the 
          sociopolitical movements that characterize the time from the last decade 
          of the nineteenth century to World War II.<br>
          <br>
          The research project has been conceived as an intervention in the ongoing 
          international debate on the culture that produced modernist and avant-garde 
          practices. Through a re-reading of the rich intersections of art, life 
          and history, and of diverse positions and practices, the project intends 
          to re-construct and recover for present investigation the multiple directions 
          that were open in actual history but were either abandoned or reduced 
          and flattened out by subsequent critical and historical narratives and 
          theories. A key thematic and theoretical aspect of the project is the 
          reconstruction of the maps of real and lived spaces as well as of the 
          new maps of experience and cognition generated by interpersonal and 
          intercultural exchanges.<br>

          <b>AFGHAN WOMEN&#146;S SUPPORT</b>: Immediate Aid Needed <br>
          for the Mother and Child Health Clinic in Peshawar<br>
          <br>
          Afghan Women&#146;s Support is a group of concerned women in Boston 
          who have come together to bring immediate aid to Afghan women and children 
          in a specific refugee camp in Peshawar, Pakistan. Here the Afghan Women&#146;s 
          Council, founded in 1986 by Mrs. Fatana Gailani, runs the Ariana School 
          and the Mother and Child Health clinic, which provide education and 
          medical care to refugee families; it also publishes the monthly <i>Zan-e-Afghan</i> 
          (Afghan Women) in order to mobilize Afghan women and to bring peace 
          and stability to the children of their country.<br>
          <br>
          A lack of access to education has been one of the most far-reaching 
          problems for Afghan children. The Ariana School, with a current enrollment 
          of 2000 boys and girls (grades 1-12) and a professional faculty of 65 
          teaching in two shifts, was founded by the AWC in 1986.<br>
          <br>
          In the current crisis, the Ariana School continues to provide education 
          to the refugee children. Afghan girls can take up their long-interrupted 
          studies. Graduates of the school are given training in teaching and 
          journalism in order to continue widening the access to quality education 
          for Afghan children everywhere, and to promote communication among the 
          refugees.<br>
          <br>
          Since its inception, the <b>Mother and Child Health Clinic</b> has focused 
          on these services: obstetrics/gynecology; pediatrics; vaccination; laboratory 
          testing; and pharmaceutical distribution. A mobile clinic serves those 
          whose injuries or disabilities are too severe to allow them to make 
          clinic visits. An education program includes instruction on family planning 
          and pregnancy management, first aid, oral rehydration therapy, nutrition 
          and hygiene. A 20-bed hospital has been established in Kabul City.<br>
          <br>
          Faced with an immense influx of new patients since October, 2001, the 
          Mother and Child Health Clinic is in desperate need of medical supplies 
          and blankets, sweaters, socks, mittens, and any warm clothing in any 
          size. All these can be purchased in Pakistan, but funding is needed 
          at once.<br>
          <br>
          We are asking for immediate financial aid as Central Asia&#146;s cold 
          winter is worsening. The Peshawar camps in Northeastern Pakistan are 
          radically vulnerable. You can make a huge difference to the women and 
          children who are there. Financial aid will go directly to them over 
          this winter. It will provide hope and energy to the courageous Afghan 
          women and their children, and help in the rejuvenation of post-war post-Taliban 
          Afghanistan. Above all, it will save lives.<br>
          <br>

          in Peshawar set up for this purpose alone.<br>

          New (old?) male-female ratio </b><br>
          <br>
          Editors:<br>
          I have just started publishing a magazine* that tries to print an equal<br>
          number of men and women, and have found the blind submission ratio <br>
          beetween men and women to be about 75/25. When discussing this problem 
          <br>
          with my fellow editors we used both How2 and Elizabeth Treadwell's publishing 
          <br>
          ventures as examples to follow when it comes to seeking out and supporting<br>
          women's writing.<br>
          <br>
          Which gives you some context for the following question/observation: 
          <br>
          I am curious--this is not a criticism--it seems as if there are more 
          male <br>
          contributors in the current issue than in the past. As I am just beginning 
          <br>
          to look at this new issue (n.6) of the magazine, I can't fully speak 
          to the caliber <br>
          of the articles, but still the increase in male contributors caught 
          my eye. <br>
          If you have any thoughts on the matter, I'd love to hear them.<br>
          I think How2 is still a necessity, and I read it because it is unique.<br>

          </b>excerpts from Frances Presley<b> <br>
          <br>
          London observation</b>s<br>
          <br>
          ....I'm trying to formulate my thoughts, both in prose and poetry <br>
          from London.... It's a way to reexplore London, and its <br>
          fissures and scars....Here are also some reflections from a Laurie <br>
          Anderson concert I went to shortly after NYC/9.11 events. <br>
          <br>
          &#149; <br>
          <br>
          Went to the Laurie Anderson concert on Friday night, and she said some<br>
          words at the beginning about the attack on New York. She spoke in very<br>
          general terms about 'positions' and did not really define what hers 
          is. <br>
          The concert itself was quite a mix of old and new, not the total concept 
          of<br>
          new work I have come to expect, and there was no visual accompaniment. 
          <br>
          The Royal Festival Hall was full, and I was miles from the stage. A 
          man in<br>
          the row behind me, obviously a devotee, was describing how he had just 
          <br>
          cashed in his BT shares for some others in an American plane manufacturer:<br>
          &quot;they're American planes, made in America,&quot; he quipped. <br>
          <br>
          I was enjoying the concert in parts when Anderson started 'O Superman', 
          and <br>
          then I was suddenly attentive. It seemed to take on a new meaning: &quot;here 
          come<br>
          the planes&quot;, &quot;they're American planes, made in America&quot;, 
          &quot;come as you are, pay as<br>
          you go&quot;. She also draws on biblical language in a machine world 
          to make it seem like<br>
          the only language possible. It is a language of prophecy, and it is 
          also the language we<br>
          turn to after bereavement when nothing else will do. But as Anderson 
          <br>
          demonstrates, we must know how it intersects with every other language 
          that we use. <br>
          <br>
          &quot;O Superman&quot; also contains, as you will remember, the messages 
          on the<br>
          answer phone from mom: &quot;Is anybody there? Are you coming home?&quot; 
          I too<br>
          saw the news reports of people playing back the last answer phone messages. 
          And <br>
          then I was in tears: &quot;And when justice has gone there's always 
          mom&quot;. I was in tears <br>
          also because my own mother had died since I first heard &quot;O Superman&quot;, 
          and she used <br>
          to leave messages on my answer phone, which sometimes ended with &quot;love 
          mum&quot;. <br>
          Now I know there's another level of unthinking emotionalism in all this, 
          of &quot;momism&quot;, <br>
          as I've heard it described recently. What we're reaching for is a thinking 
          emotion.<br>

          <b>&quot;Peace&quot; vs. &quot;Global Responsibility&quot;<br>
          (a discussion between Cynthia Hogue and Jeanne Heuving)<br>
          <br>
          11/8/01 :</b> from C.H.<b> </b><br>
          <br>
          Dear Jeanne,<br>
          <br>
          I was struck by your comment that you saw little use in commentary on 
          How2's Forum calling for peace (primarily my piece, although you don't 
          mention me specifically), and that you rather thought it a time to call 
          for Global Responsibility. I wouldn't have thought that the two are 
          mutually exclusive. I would be interested in hearing more of your thoughts 
          and distinctions. Mine have been evolving in the weeks since the bombing 
          started, as I have heard Afghan women activists interviewed on Democracy 
          Now--who are in favor of the bombing, and as more civilians have been 
          killed. I wonder if your views have been gelling as well as we try to 
          figure out what is happening through some serious censorship and quelling 
          of dissenting voices. Although it seemed clear to me that you disagreed 
          with me, I am not sure that I disagree with you--but I was also not 
          sure what you meant.<br>
          <br>
          Kathleen would be open to our exchanging on the Forum, and while I do 
          not wish to get into a long exchange, I would be interested in your 
          clarification and amplification of your views. <br>
          <br>
          Hope your book is coming along well--I missed seeing you at MSA. I am 
          on my very first sabbatical and pretty much in heaven at the Wurlitzer 
          in Taos, which I strongly recommend you apply to for a residency. It 
          is low key, in the mts. very beautiful.<br>

          <br>
          Dear Cynthia,<br>
          In tracking down my rather quickly thrown off comment about &quot;peace,&quot; 
          I find I said this: &quot;I can't find much meaning in this crisis in 
          the call for 'peace' exactly--I find 'gobal responsibility' much more 
          resonant.&quot;--and then I equivocated about the word &quot;responsibility.&quot; 
          (email, 10/19). In this email I was searching, really, for a slogan 
          or a banner which would address my desire for political action at this 
          time. If I could take these words back into my mouth, or rather eat 
          them up through backspace, I would rather say, &quot;I find 'global 
          justice' much more resonant.&quot; Justice is a trendy word in academia 
          right now, but I like it because it suggests that as global citizens 
          our responsibility may well exist through an ultimately highly responsive 
          and imaginative set of actions that produce &quot;justice.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I applaud your understanding of the spiralling effects of violence (postcard 
          10/9), and indeed, I think non-violence is often the best strategy. 
          But &quot;peace,&quot; ah it seems far too peaceful for this world--not 
          as you intend it--but as I read it quickly and callously--as a banner 
          for the movement I would join. When we first started bombing Afghanistan, 
          I was dismayed that the most visible political movements in Seattle 
          were &quot;Peace&quot; movements. I was not for the bombing in Afghanistan, 
          exactly, anymore than I am for any of a number of &quot;police&quot; 
          actions, but then I do depend on the safety net they provide me. I remain 
          unsure how to respond to this crisis, since it seems to tap into all 
          of the most unsolveable dilemmas: global capitalism reproducing itself 
          through amazingly powerful media. How to listen differently even if 
          one has the space and time to search out alternative messages? How to 
          communicate outside of the propaganda machine?<br>
          <br>
          You want to redefine &quot;honor&quot; as &quot;being able to hear both 
          sides, both perspectives.&quot; Yes, but are there really only two sides 
          here, two perspectives? The word justice implies for me a transformative 
          multiplicity--where the listening changes with the doing. Yet, I am 
          not sure what to do? I know that in Seattle there are many groups actively 
          involved in the politics of different parts of the world, yet I am already 
          more than busy with the things that I do. So, I wonder how might I redirect 
          these responsibilities--to do what?<br>
          Say, for instance, how can HOW2 listen for women's voices that are trying 
          to &quot;say&quot; their experiences and lives differently? If words 
          matter, and we are wordsmiths, what words to use? And how will we know 
          whether by our words we are producing &quot;global justice&quot;?<br>
          <br>
          Love,<br>

          am writing to you out of a deep concern that matters of women's<br>
          liberation are being cynically used by the U.S. government to gather 
          support<br>
          or the current war--a war that, I believe, is being waged by the U.S. 
          for unjust<br>
          geopolitical and economic gain. I hope that, after reading the following,<br>
          you will give support to any statement or action about women's lives 
          in<br>
          Afghanistan _only if_ that statement/action _also_ demands &quot;Stop 
          the<br>
          War!U.S. Out of Afghanistan!&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>Perhaps 
          you feel that's an extreme statement, given current events. But<br>
          please, read the following to see why I feel so strongly about this.<br>
          I am writing to you after reading an article in Sunday's NY Times<br>
          (November 11, 2001, p. B6) with the headline &quot;Adept in Politics 
          and Advertising, 4<br>
          Women Shape a Campaign.&quot; The women, who included chief Pentagon<br>
          spokeswoman Victoria Clarke, are described there as &quot;among the 
          Bush administration's </o:p><br>
          <o:p>most important shapers of the words and images that the allies 
          are<br>
          seeking to convey to a global audience.&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          final quote of the article is from Mary Matalin, chief political adviser<br>
          to Vice Presiden Dick Cheney. She says of her committment to advocating<br>
          for the war: &quot;I think we [the 4 women] probably bring--and I don't 
          mean this to<br>
          sound sexist--but we probably have more of a subconscious outrage at<br>
          these issues...This is something that crosses my mind every day: a third 
          of<br>
          these women in pre-Taliban days were doctors, lawyers and teachers. 
          You can't<br>
          help but be outraged.&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>I 
          am outraged by this cynical use of the lives of women. Here is a<br>
          historical context for Matalin's remarks (sources at end if not cited 
          in<br>
          text):</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>In 
          1978 a secular government came to power in Afghanistan. This<br>
          government immediately moved to improve the terrible feudal conditions 
          of women. <br>
          It set up literacy programs especially for women, whose illiteracy rate<br>
          was 96%. It trained more teachers and published textbooks in local languages.<br>
          It trainedbrigades of women to go into countryside to provide medical 
          services<br>
          and by 1985 increased hospital beds by 80%. It prohibited the brideprice 
          and<br>
          gave women freedom to choose their marriages. It prohibited punishment 
          of<br>
          women for losing their virginity before marriage, It made it possible 
          for women<br>
          to train and then work as doctors, teachers, and lawyers. The government<br>
          also cancelled mortgage debts of laborers and tenants; these debts had 
          been<br>
          inherited over generations so that feudal warlords held landworkers 
          as<br>
          virtual serfs.</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>It 
          was this government that U.S. President Jimmy Carter set out to<br>
          overthrow by beginning to send money and equipment to fundamentalist<br>
          opposition groups in 1979. This inital effort grew into even more extensive<br>
          U.S. backing of the Taliban, the Northern Alliance and other factions, 
          all of<br>
          which drew their power from the feudal landlord class.</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          secular goverment that promoted the welfare and liberation of all<br>
          women was a young socialist movement, the Progressive Democratic Party<br>
          of Afghanistan (PDPA). &quot;The CIA actually created Osama bin Laden's<br>
          organization back in the 1980s to attack...the progressive government<br>
          in Afghanistan. As vice president, George Bush Sr. oversaw the operation. 
          In<br>
          the Agency's employ, bin Laden's troops murdered teachers, doctors and<br>
          nurses, disfigured women who took off the veil, and shot down civilian<br>
          airliners with U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles.</o:p></font></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          U.S. has known all along the reactionary position on women of the<br>
          U.S.-financed and trained fundamentalist groups--and the U.S.<br>
          government did not care. Instead, U.S. government policy has been to 
          support<br>
          the interest of U.S. oil in the Central Asia region. These oil corporations 
          have<br>
          been trying to get a pipeline through Afghanistan for about 10 years.<br>
          From a May 26, 1997, New York Times article by John F. Burns: &quot;While<br>
          deploring the Taliban's policies on women and the adoption of a penal<br>
          code that provides for the amputation of thieves' hands and the stoning 
          to<br>
          death of adulterers, the United States has sometimes acted as though 
          a<br>
          Taliban government might serve its interests. The Clinton Administration<br>
          has taken the view that a Taliban victory would end a war that has killed 
          1.5<br>
          million Afghans; would act as a counterweight to Iran, whose Shiite 
          Muslim<br>
          leadership is fiercely opposed to the Sunni Muslims of the Taliban, 
          and<br>
          would offer the possibility of new trade routes that could weaken Russian<br>
          and Iranian influence in the region. For example, a proposal by the 
          Unocal<br>
          Corporation of California for a $2.5 billion pipeline that would link 
          the gas<br>
          fields of Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan has attracted 
          strong<br>
          support in Washington, though human rights groups are likely to object 
          to<br>
          the plan....</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          Afghan project, strongly endorsed by the Taliban, is part of a broader<br>
          concept under which the vast mineral resources of the former Soviet 
          republics<br>
          would be moved to markets along routes that would offer these countries 
          a<br>
          new autonomy from Moscow.&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>In 
          May 1998, Time magazine reported that the CIA had &quot;set up a secret<br>
          task force to monitor the region's politics and gauge its wealth. Covert 
          CIA<br>
          officers, some well-trained petroleum engineers, had traveled through<br>
          southern Russia and the Caspian region to sniff out potential oil reserves.<br>
          When the policymakers heard the agency's report, [Secretary of State<br>
          Madeline] Albright concluded that 'working to mold the area's future 
          was<br>
          one of the most exciting things we can do.'&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>After 
          some setbacks to U.S. efforts Caucasuswatch.com (which describes itself<br>
          as an intelligence service for the oil industry) wrote in January 2001: 
          &quot;With<br>
          the coming of a Sino-Russian pact of mutual assistance and an Iranian 
          acceptance<br>
          of the Russian proposal to carve up the Caspian Sea, any chance the 
          U.S. had of <br>
          cementing alliances in the region seemed doomed. The incoming American 
          <br>
          administration, heavy in oil and related interests, will likely try 
          to reverse <br>
          this trend. How effective they will be is open to question.&quot;</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>A 
          more recent entry on the Caucasuswatch Web site tied U.S. &quot;Big 
          Oil&quot;<br>
          future in the region to: &quot;the success of the Central Asian counterstrike.&quot; 
          That<br>
          article was posted on April 24, 2001.</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          U.S. has cared not a whit for women who were &quot;doctors, lawyers 
          and<br>
          teachers&quot; when they were flourishing under a secular government--nor<br>
          did it care for the Afghan women of the countryside living under feudal<br>
          conditions.</o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p>The 
          U.S. armed and trained the Taliban because the U.S. power interests<br>
          hoped the return of the feudal warlords to power would give the U.S. 
          oil<br>
          companies a chance at that pipeline--a chance that a secular socialist<br>
          government would not give them. (A historical note here: The U.S. began<br>
          its war against the secular government six months before the U.S.S.R.<br>
          intervened with troops. [p.146, &quot;From the Shadows,&quot; an autobiography

          Now the U.S. government is trying to use the very women whose lives<br>
          were _crushed and ended_ by U.S. interference and power politics! The<br>

          terrible abuse and deaths of women under fundamentalist forces.<br>
          Now the U.S. is trying to use the very deaths of women that _it caused_

          read her essay &quot;Growing Up Sacred&quot; which she wrote for a book

          charmed me being deeply marked by her work as a critic and as a teacher

          I posted the following to the poetics list, but really I think I want 
          to<br>
          target more female writers--<br>
          <br>
          do you think you might be able to pass this around to people you think<br>
          might be interested? (of both genders--I'm not being gender-exclusive 
          with <br>
          this, but so far I've heard from more men than women, and want to publish<br>
          more women than men...)<br>
          thanks so much--<br>

          Empathy in the TV Coverage of the World Trade Center Attack</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          TV images of the World Trade Center burning were horribly familiar yet 
          they stood without parallel. Black smoke billowed from both buildings 
          and I thought I saw a free-falling body twist its way past the gaping 
          hole in Tower One. Yet the studio voices that accompanied the images 
          did not mention it. Had they not seen him or her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>TV anchors, some calm, some excited, repeated that a plane had 
          crashed into the North Tower, then hit the second one. It was live footage 
          of real buildings burning in real time, but they stood silent, with 
          no natural sound, at the surreal distance evoked by long camera shots. 
          As I watched, another explosion tore through the second tower and flames 
          silently consumed a lower portion of the building. The only frame or 
          reference for such images is the fictional narratives of computer-generated 
          action films in which cities are mutilated and destroyed. Independence 
          Day, one such cartoon-like adventure, demolished New York and Washington, 
          the very cities I now watched burning.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our 
          perceptions have been permanently framed by the sensibilities of those 
          commanding fictions, and TV practitioners are certainly under the sway 
          of the techno-hyper-real. It seemed as if we were living through Life 
          the Movie. These events had already happened and this was some sort 
          of spectacular sequel. Openly awed by the visual spectacle, &#8220;it 
          was quite a sight,&#8221; one intoned. Some awareness, just below the 
          level of waking, continued to nag at my reception of the pictures, aren&#8217;t 
          there people in the buildings? The TV voices were not helping even as 
          they recounted, over and over, the actual events. A pilot on a remote 
          phone connection with Channel 4 had seen, &#8220;the plane screaming 
          by at full power.&#8221; By the time he looked out his apartment window, 
          about 4 or 5 seconds later, it had hit Tower One. As he spoke the buildings 
          burned benignly against the sky of the clear September day. Though there 
          was emotion in his voice, it was hard to bring actual human beings into 
          this zone that was essentially fictional, uniquely visual, and usually 
          without real consequences. After all, we didn&#8217;t mourn for the 
          thousands who died in Independence Day. But didn&#8217;t I just see 
          someone, an actual person&#8217;s body falling to the ground?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
          people we did hear from were the ones already out of harm's way Eyewitnesses 
          told how they had fled the building. A misguided sense of responsibility 
          might have prevented reporters from attending to those still inside. 
          Was it some desire to prevent mass hysteria? Later that night, when 
          I finally got through to my friends in SoHo, I heard their sorrow at 
          seeing dozens of people crowded at the windows on the floors with no 
          exit routes. A man very near the top had waved a white cloth through 
          a broken window for at least 45 minutes. He never got out. After 7 hours 
          of watching television, I had not heard any such stories. Whatever the 
          reasons, television did not see fit to allow us to grieve for the people 
          left trapped in the building at the time it went down. We will never 
          be able to have that collectively summoned moment of silence they all 
          deserved.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There 
          was much concern for the NewYork skyline. At Newark airport one journalist 
          pointed a camera over the tails of a fleet of United jets to find empty 
          sky, where this morning he told us, we would have seen the World Trade 
          Center. Throughout the day TV openly lamented the loss of the buildings, 
          yet the fact that people lay buried under the rubble was almost never 
          mentioned. One police officer requesting anonymity estimated losses 
          in the thousands. Whether the media decided for themselves, or simply 
          followed official admonitions, the effect was the same. One journalist 
          actually used the term &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; for those killed, 
          diminishing the humanity of those lost.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A 
          New Yorker covered in soot ran down the street. He came in and out of 
          the frame, and as he did I could see his lips move but the sound was 
          off. The studio voices were always laid over the images, they interpreted, 
          explained, but never let me hear the people on the street. Some considered 
          media worthy were brought into the studio or moved out of the direct 
          action and interviewed, but only short snippets of what they said were 
          aired. We were told that a storeowner was giving out water, but I did 
          not see such meaningful moments.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to be with my fellow New Yorkers, sharing their struggles 
          for survival, and grieving for the ones lost. Instead, there was the 
          endless repetition of the most dramatic images. In addition to The Towers 
          Burning were images reminiscent of other movies including, Armageddon; 
          clouds of dust and rubble billowing from between the buildings, pursuing 
          people running away in the street. Repeating the picture over and over 
          with no sound removed it from real experience and turned it into a fascination. 
          By days end one of the newsmagazines had produced a slick sequence molded 
          into familiar entertainments, &#8220;doctors and interns lined up like 
          on a set of a disaster movie.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I 
          didn&#8217;t want to be a detached observer, awed by the spectacle, 
          entertained by cleaver references, calmed by the stories deemed appropriate 
          by gatekeepers. I wanted to be a thinking, feeling citizen, part of 
          a human community pulling together in a crisis. I wanted local reporters 
          in the streets getting the story on the ground. By the next day, local 
          news was doing just that, giving out help-line numbers, reporting on 
          family members searching for loved-ones, and in general being good citizens.<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This 
          disaster has no frame of reference adequate for its expression and able 
          to grasp its meanings. The fictional frames are just that, entertainments. 
          We grasp for a way to express human dignity in the face of terrible 
          loss. We do have storylines and image conventions for death, ones applied 
          to people outside of our own communities. When the media air grizzly 
          pictures of famine, disasters, death and war elsewhere, they are usually 
          presented with little context, from a detached perspective: people crowded 
          together, under attack, starving, suffering horrible indignities. These 
          people are presented as the Other, through narratives of exclusion, 
          as little more than sights for our fascination. Ethical battles have 
          been fought, some won, some lost, about airing graphic depictions of 
          human horror. Many have been deemed too ratings worthy to be shelved. 
          We have no words, no media frames that can recognize the sadness of 
          death as it happens, while preserving the dignity of those it is happening 
          to. Media sensationalism often overcomes our feelings of empathy and 
          compassion. Are these the reasons we could not acknowledge that the 
          buildings were full of people?<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
          city is beginning to come to terms with the loss of life, as family 
          members search for those still missing and unaccounted for. No doubt 
          there are pictures and footage that we have not yet seen, of the horrible 
          events that occurred on Tuesday. More footage of the people who jumped 
          out of the buildings is starting to be aired. The audio track of screams 
          and chaos are beginning to accompany the repeated disaster footage. 
          Let us hope that these horrible sights don&#8217;t become the source 
          of revenue, or ratings boosters when commercials make their way back 
          on to our television screens. Hopefully we will now be more aware of 
          the need for empathy and compassion when we tell stories of death, loss 
          and destruction, not only for ourselves, but also for those who find 
          themselves in front of our cameras in other parts of the world.<o:p></o:p></font></p>

        The film footage is wobbly and blurry but stunning: A soccer stadium in 
        <br>
        Afghanistan is packed with people, but there is no match today. Instead,<br>
        a pickup truck drives into the stadium with three women, shrouded in<br>
        burqas, cowering in the back. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Armed men in turbans 
        force a woman from the truck, and make her kneel at the penalty line on 
        the field. Confused and unable to see, the woman tries to look behind 
        just as a rifle is pointed against the back of her<br>
        head. With no fanfare whatsoever, she is shot dead. The shaky video<br>
        camera captures the cheering crowd as people rise to their feet, hoping<br>
        to get a better view of the corpse on the ground. The blue folds of the<br>
        burqa begin to stain red with blood. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This public execution 
        is some of the most shocking film ever seen on<br>
        television; it is perhaps the best document that the West has of<br>
        atrocities committed by the Taliban. It is just one part of an<br>
        astonishing hour-long documentary called &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot; 
        currently<br>
        in heavy rotation on CNN. Filmed by the half-Afghan British reporter<br>
        Saira Shah, who traveled undercover to Afghanistan last year, &quot;Beneath<br>
        the Veil&quot; neatly captures the horror of life under the Taliban--the<br>
        public executions for infractions as minor as prostitution or adultery, 
        <br>
        the brutality of fundamentalist police, the slaughter of civilians<br>
        unlucky enough to live on the front line of the civil war with the<br>
        Northern Alliance. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In documenting life 
        under the Taliban, Shah went into the homes of the<br>
        Afghan people and onto the battlefields, cleverly evading the<br>
        Department of Vice and Virtue, which would have thrown her in jail for<br>
        filming illegally (all unsanctioned filming is forbidden). She visited 
        <br>
        territory occupied by the Northern Alliance, and visited a village where<br>
        the Taliban had brutally murdered dozens of civilians just weeks<br>
        earlier-- a local wedding photographer had filmed the scene as<br>
        villagers buried rotting bodies that had been scalped and mutilated. <br>
        There, Shah also interviewed three teenage girls whose mother had been<br>
        shot dead by the Taliban. They were so traumatized by the atrocities<br>
        that the Taliban subsequently inflicted upon them that two of them<br>
        would no longer speak. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But some of the most 
        heartstopping footage in &quot;Beneath the Veil,&quot;<br>
        including film of the execution of the women in the soccer stadium, was<br>
        captured not by Shah but by an Afghan underground organization which<br>
        assisted her in her work. Indeed, Shah's documentary would not have<br>
        been possible were it not for the Revolutionary Association of the<br>
        Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), an underground organization whose members 
        risk their lives every day in attempts to undermine the Taliban and publicize 
        its brutality. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">RAWA was originally 
        founded in 1977 as an Afghan feminist group<br>
        focused on women's rights, but its mandate broadened when<br>
        fundamentalists rose to power. Determined to expose the frightening<br>
        abuses of the Taliban, women in the group began to hide video cameras<br>
        under their burqa and document the executions and public floggings<br>
        which take place every day under the Taliban. They also smuggle female<br>
        journalists like Shaila Shah and Eve Ensler, writer/director of &quot;The<br>
        Vagina Monologues,&quot; into the country, in hopes of bringing attention<br>
        to their cause. In defiance of the Taliban's law forbidding education<br>
        for women, RAWA also runs clandestine home-based schools for girls; for<br>
        women, who are forbidden to work, RAWA teaches handicrafts and sells<br>
        them online. In the refugee camps in Pakistan, RAWA also provides<br>
        medical assistance, housing and education for impoverished and <br>
        terrified fugitives of Taliban rule. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">RAWA, the most prominent 
        Afghan-run organization to oppose the<br>
        Taliban, has become one of the fundamentalists' greatest enemies.<br>
        Perhaps the aspect of the group most infuriating to its opponents-- and<br>
        a surprising key to its effectiveness -- is that it consists entirely<br>
        of women, nearly 2,000 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, who use the cover<br>
        of their burqas and the seeming powerlessness of their status to<br>
        strategic advantage. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By traveling with 
        RAWA, Shah got a first-hand view of what it's like<br>
        to be a woman living under the Taliban, and she was invited into RAWA's<br>
        secret schools and illegal meetings. She also got access to its library<br>
        of video footage -- which includes not just the film of the execution<br>
        of the women, but footage of the public hanging of three men in the same<br>
        soccer stadium. (The soccer stadium was funded by international aid<br>
        groups who wanted to raise the spirits of the Afghan people; instead,<br>
        the Taliban is using it only for executions. One Taliban official told<br>
        Shah that if the aid groups felt that the stadium should be used for <br>
        soccer, they should build the Taliban an extra stadium for<br>
        executions.) &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; was filmed long before the attacks 
        of<br>
        Sept. 11, and, according to RAWA members, the situation in Afghanistan<br>
        has since become more dire. Because the borders between Pakistan and<br>
        Afghanistan have closed, the Afghan people are now trapped in their own<br>
        country-- enduring the oppressive rule of the Taliban while waiting<br>
        for U.S. bombs to drop from the sky. RAWA, meanwhile, says it is running<br>
        out of money and can't afford to educate, feed and treat the millions<br>
        of refugees massed along the border. The Pakistani police, which are<br>
        sympathetic to the Taliban, regularly target RAWA members; and since<br>
        communication with Afghanistan has been cut off, the RAWA members in <br>
        Pakistan know little about what is happening to their members across the<br>
        border. <br>
        <br>
        In a telephone interview from Islamabad, a 26-year-old member of RAWA, 
        identified only as &quot;Fatima,&quot; spoke about RAWA's work in Pakistan 
        and Afghanistan, its position on war and the Northern Alliance, and its<br>
        &quot;uncompromising attitude&quot; toward fundamentalism. A seven-year 
        veteran<br>
        of the group's dangerous brand of activism, Fatima is a member of the 
        <br>
        RAWA political committee that has been trying to rally both Afghan women 
        and the international media to its agenda. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. What is your life 
        story, and what do you do for RAWA? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. I'm from Kabul. 
        I started to work with RAWA when I was 19 years old. There has been war 
        in our country for more than 23 years; my generationwas born with war, 
        we've experienced just crimes, just blackness, just sorrow in our country. 
        We never saw happiness or democracy. I lived in shock, because every day 
        there were tragic stories in my neighborhood around me. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When I was young 
        I decided to do something about this. A lot of young<br>
        girls commit suicide because they are helpless and hopeless. But some,<br>
        like me, choose the way of struggle. We accept that we want to serve<br>
        our people -- that this is the best way to bring justice to our country. 
        <br>
        When I was 20 years old, I left Afghanistan; my job for RAWA was to<br>
        come here to Pakistan and work in the refugee camps. I had to cross the 
        border often and go back into Afghanistan to organize women for<br>
        demonstrations; and to bring RAWA's publications into Afghanistan. We<br>
        would go secretly and without documents -- no one asks you for them <br>
        because you are a woman. I wear the burqa then, because this is the<br>
        only visa required for women to enter Afghanistan. When I<br>
        cross the border, no one can know that I am in RAWA. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. Why do you use 
        the pseudonym &quot;Fatima&quot;? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A.We all use different 
        names all the time, because we have a lot of<br>
        security problems. Our leader Meena and her bodyguards were<br>
        assassinated in Pakistan in 987 by the Islamic fundamentalists and the<br>
        KGB. Our members are always attacked and injured -- we receive death<br>
        threats by e-mail and letters and telephone, telling us to stop what we<br>
        are doing or they will kill us. So we are working clandestinely in <br>
        Afghanistan, and in Pakistan we are half-secret. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. Have you ever 
        been personally attacked by the Taliban?<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. I was flogged 
        three times in the streets, for stupid reasons. They<br>
        will flog women that don't have the veil on, or aren't with their male<br>
        relative, or are talking to a male shopkeeper, or are out on the<br>
        streets during the evening. There are always people sobbing in the<br>
        streets because they are being beaten. This is normal. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Pakistan in1999, 
        I was injured at a RAWA demonstration. Pakistan<br>
        is one of the countries that officially recognizes the Taliban<br>
        government; so when we take our anti-Taliban slogans into the streets,<br>
        they try to stop us. During the demonstration, we were fighting -- we<br>
        wanted to go in front of the United Nations building; but the Pakistani<br>
        police wanted to stop us. During the fighting, they beat me and broke<br>
        my hand. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. What has been 
        RAWA's most crucial activity in Afghanistan? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We teach hundreds 
        of women and children in the underground schools in Afghanistan. For children, 
        we teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, Persian, science, social studies 
        and the history of Afghanistan; also, the geography of the world. For 
        women, we just teach them two main subjects -- mathematics and Persian. 
        When our women go to the shops, they don't know how to pay the shopkeeper 
        and get change, because they haven't had an education. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We also bring in 
        video cameras to expose the crimes of the Taliban.<br>
        It's risky work. We filmed the execution of the women that you saw in<br>
        &quot;Beneath the Veil.&quot; Also, we've filmed hangings in Kabul and 
        several<br>
        other cities, taken pictures of Afghans who have had their hands cut<br>
        off for stealing, or their necks cut. There are photos on our Web site. 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We make a hole in 
        the burqa and film through it. That's why the<br>
        quality of our films is very bad; it's very difficult. No one has ever<br>
        been caught doing it; but execution is the only punishment if you get<br>
        caught, especially if the Taliban knew we were RAWA.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. What are you doing 
        in the refugee camps in Pakistan? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We have schools 
        for girls in the fugitive camps; but in some we have<br>
        problems because of the influence of the fundamentalists. We have<br>
        handicraft projects for women; we run chicken farms, a jam-making<br>
        business and carpet weaving projects. We also have mobile medical teams 
        that go in to the camps one or two days a week to give free medicine. 
        We had a hospital called Malalai, but it closed because of our financial 
        problems; one of our very urgent projects is to reopen it. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. What are your 
        feelings about the attack on America? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We are so sorry 
        for the victims of this terrorist attack. We want to<br>
        shower them with deep solidarity. We can understand their sorrow because 
        we also suffered this terrorism for more than 23 years. We were already 
        victims of this tragedy. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the other hand, 
        unfortunately, we warned the United States<br>
        government about this many, many times; as well as the other countries 
        that are supporting and creating the fundamentalist parties. They helped 
        create these terrorists during the Cold War; they supported Osama bin 
        Laden [during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan]. Fundamentalism is 
        equal to terrorism; it's equal to crime. We said, this germ won't just 
        be in Afghanistan, it will spread out all over the world. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today we can see 
        this with our own eyes. We warned them but they never listened to our 
        cry, to our voice. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. How is the crisis 
        in America affecting your work at RAWA? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. Thousands of families 
        are escaping from Afghanistan, leaving everything behind because they 
        are afraid of war. Thousands of others that are living in Afghanistan 
        don't have the possibility to immigrate here; and now, even the borders 
        are closed. That means that our people have to burn in the flame of war 
        and all the doors are closed. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In fugitive camps 
        it's really hard to work, especially hard because<br>
        millions of fugitives have just arrived. They are in shock, and have<br>
        nothing but themselves and the clothes on their back. I met a family<br>
        yesterday that wanted help from RAWA, they cried and said they walked 
        through the mountains because the border was closed. Their child fell 
        down the mountain and died, but they couldn't stop because they had to 
        escape. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our people escape 
        from Afghanistan because of the fear of killing and<br>
        rape and torture, but they will die in the refugee camps because of lack<br>
        of food, jobs and healthcare. Even here the situation is not good. We<br>
        are in a crisis in the camps; thousands have contacted us for help and<br>
        we don't know how to help them. At every moment they want their children 
        to be in our orphanages or our schools; they want a house, medicine --they 
        need everything, and we have no money. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also we are so worried 
        about our members inside Afghanistan, about<br>
        their lives. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. Are you concerned 
        about a war with the United States? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We are condemning 
        an attack of the U.S. on Afghanistan, because it<br>
        won't be the Taliban but our people who will be the victims. The United 
        States should decry these terrorist groups in Afghanistan; but not<br>
        through an attack. Maybe through commando attacks, though. We do want 
        the United Nations to be more active -- their rule is very important in 
        this moment. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We also want to convey 
        a message to the American people that there's a difference between the 
        people of Afghanistan and the criminal government of Afghanistan. There 
        is a river of blood between them. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. Do you support 
        the Northern Alliance? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We condemn the 
        cooperation of the United States with the Northern<br>
        Alliance. This is another nightmare for our people -- the Northern<br>
        Alliance are the second Taliban. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Northern Alliance 
        are hypocrites: They say they are for democracy<br>
        and human rights, but we can't forget the black experience we had with<br>
        them. Seventy-year-old grandmothers were raped during their rule,<br>
        thousands of girls were raped, thousands were killed and tortured. They 
        are the first government that started this tragedy in Afghanistan. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Q. What government 
        do you support, then? <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A. We are ready to

        wish to express our shock and extend our deep sympathy to the relatives

        It is hard for us to see the suffering, even from across the seas, even 
        as trauma counselors ourselves. And we cry for the people of many nations, 
        ethnicities, and religions who died. The people of Kosova have put up

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        have lived through war. We have been greatly helped in our recovery, by 
        the United States representatives, who talked against revenge and promoted 
        reconciliation as essential to achieve a future with true peace and democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
        </span><o:p></o:p></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        know what it is like to be attacked, to grieve and to feel anger. Every 
        day we attend to the physical and emotional pains of the women in our 
        communities who continue to suffer from the violence of war. We listen 
        to the stories and work together with women to find ways to productively 
        channel negative emotions. Women in Kosova, still suffering from the symptoms

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Therefore 
        we understand the urge for revenge is strong. And we know that it must 
        not be given in to. We know that a violent response can only bring more 
        violence. It does not bring justice. Instead it kills more innocent victims 
        and gives birth to new holy avengers. It begins a new cycle and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        more death amongst civilians. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We

      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        do not wish to have you see your young men go to war and lose their lives, 
        like thousands of our sons, fathers, and husbands did. We are horrified 
        that there is talk of attacking and putting at risk millions of people&#8217;s 
        lives because of the acts of a few. We do not wish to have war on a country 
        or countries full of innocent adults and children, who already suffer 
        at the hands of their leaders and whom themselves have committed no crimes. 
        We know that bombs are not smart, we know they kill women, children, and 
        old people and we know only too well, that it is mainly the women who 
        bear the task of rebuilding societies torn apart by war. This is our work 
        at present and it is very hard work. We do not wish to see countries' 
        economies devastated, and its people made poorer for generations to come. 
        We do not wish to see Americans attacked, killed or made afraid in the 
        United States because of their religious or ethnic identities. We wish 
        for all nations to be proud and to build a society and a politics that 
        respects individuals and groups, and promotes diversity. <o:p></o:p></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">American

        protect the living! But we ask you not to put us and your citizens at 
        more risk. What you are threatening to unleash is making us afraid for 
        the world. Do not endanger the people of Asia, the Middle East, and northern 
        Africa. War will surely imperil us all and future generations also. Please 
        remember your past and learn from ours, and work to leave a legacy of

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">from Cynthia Hogue</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>In a Battle of 
        Wills There Are No Winners</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is four weeks 
        since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Like most of us since 
        these attacks, I have been more aware of being alive as a gift. I have 
        reached out to loved ones to tell them I love them. And like most of us, 
        I am scared and wish I didn&#146;t feel so helpless. Because as I write, 
        the U.S. has started bombing Afghanistan. The bombing does not make me 
        feel safe. It makes me feel unsafe. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the radio 
        commentators remarked on the day the bombing started, apropos of the origins 
        of war, that the Vikings didn&#146;t have a word for the meaningless escalation 
        of violence that comprises the plot of the greatest Icelandic saga, Brennu 
        Njalsaga. Njal&#146;s Saga is the story of a wise man with an unwise family. 
        What starts out as a small retaliatory exchange between two households 
        escalates, despite Njal&#146;s best peacekeeping efforts, until two whole 
        clans are involved in the rivalry. At last Njal and all his household 
        are burned alive by their enemies. When the plot is reduced to its broad 
        outlines, the horror of the violence of killing so many people is writ 
        large (one of the themes of this saga). When we reduce the September 11th 
        attacks to the nineteen young Muslim fundamentalists--the sect is so sexist 
        we need not denote their sex--who highjacked four passenger airline jets 
        and killed over 6000 people in one hour, these terrorist acts seem to 
        us clearly mad. Crazy mad. The actions of lunatics. From our perspective. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Angry mad, from their 
        perspective. Why do they hate us? Americans asked after the attack. &#147;How 
        do people reach this level of anger, hatred and frustration?&#148; asks 
        Professor of Conflict Studies John Paul Lederach. To call them lunatics 
        misses a crucial point: By my experience, explanations that they are brainwashed 
        by a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is 
        an escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed 
        responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational, identity-based 
        anger, is constructed over time through a combination of historical events, 
        a deep sense of threat to identity, and direct experience of sustained 
        exclusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the terrorists&#146; 
        perspective, they are a David heroically fighting the bully-giant Goliath, 
        who is spreading Western imperialism. If we do as they expect, which is 
        to use our power against a weak people or nation, we can expect without 
        a doubt that they will engage in the future in ever-escalating cycles 
        of revenge and violence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Vikings in fact 
        did have a word for the senseless feuding that drives the plot of Njal&#146;s 
        Saga, which is the word used to rationalize the violence by the characters. 
        It is the same word as motivated the terrorists on September 11th, the 
        same word as is motivating U.S. and British retaliation. It is a word 
        for an heroic concept, a warrior&#146;s code. That word is honor, along 
        with the component parts of the ancient heroic code: pride and shame, 
        loyalty and betrayal. One of the men interviewed on the radio the day 
        we started the bombing was a veteran of the Gulf War. When asked if he&#146;d 
        go back to war if drafted, he said, &#147;Of course. It&#146;s the warrior&#146;s 
        code, to rip the living heart out of the enemy&#146;s chest. I&#146;m 
        a warrior.&#148; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Honor requires us 
        to retaliate, or the enemy will think he can get away with murder. But 
        honor, too, will require the other side to avenge such retaliation because 
        we &#147;deserved&#148; the punishing &#147;justice&#148;they dealt us. 
        At the dawning of the twenty-first century, we discover that we understand 
        the saga&#145;s world of the blood feud and violent retaliation because, 
        to our shock and horror, we are suddenly living it. However much we refuse 
        to hear them, from the Muslim extremist perspective, the U.S. has been 
        made &#147;to pay&#148; for past grievances to the Muslim world, for which 
        we had never shown remorse. Now, we are making Afghanistan &#147;pay&#148; 
        for harboring terrorists. But Afghanistan did not attack the U.S. So, 
        the U.S. will eventually be made to &#147;pay&#148; for its harming Afghanistan. 
        How far and how long will this exchange of violence go?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We desperately need 
        another model for what is deemed an honorable response. That model also 
        lies in Njal&#146;s Saga as well, in Njal himself. The saga was written 
        after Iceland had converted in 1000 A.D. to Christianity. Thus, although 
        its action takes place before the conversion, its theme is influenced 
        by gentler Christian tenets. Njal is a pagan precursor of what I will 
        call &#147;radical Christianity&#148; (to distinguish it from the bigotry 
        of most versions of fundamentalist Christianity, much like the terrorists&#146; 
        Islamic fundamentalism must be distinguished from the gentler Muslim faith). 
        Njal counsels tolerance and negotiates nonviolent alternative responses 
        to violence. He wheels and deals for peace. Although the violence of his 
        pagan family eventually takes him down with them, he represents an alternative 
        that redefines the heroic code of honor. We need that alternative now. 
        What are the possibilities?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For a start, we could 
        redefine &#147;honor&#148; as being able to hear both sides, both perspectives, 
        not just our own. We could view violence itself as dishonorable, and every 
        &#147;holy war&#148;--both sides have bandied this phrase about--as sacrilege. 
        Certainly when we are the target, we call violence &#147;barbaric&#148;and 
        &#147;heinous.&#148; Why is it justified when we perpetrate it ourselves? 
        We could consider our own possible responses in terms other than violence. 
        And to those who say we will look weak to the world if we negotiate, we 
        could answer: We need another definition of strength. Strength is the 
        courage to wait and to make a considered response. Strength is not throwing 
        our military weight around. Strength is seeking insistently--and, why 
        not? aggressively--negotiated, diplomatic solutions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We need to honor 
        the memories of our own victims by listening to their families. Many of 
        the families of the September 11th dead are not calling for retaliation, 
        but for peacemaking. Touched so deeply and irrevocably by this tragedy, 
        these families understood more immediately than any of us that no violence 
        will return their loved ones to life, no retaliatory strike could suffice 
        to comfort them in their grief. They say again and again that their dead 
        would not wish other innocent people to die for their deaths. In escalating 
        the violence, we risk making the deaths of over 6000 civilians truly meaningless, 
        for we will have failed to understand the lesson in their deaths: that 
        how we feel now is how civilians in Baghdad felt when we bombed them, 
        how civilians in Serbia felt, how civilians in Japan felt. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Is it not dishonorable 
        that we were indifferent to the pain we caused? We need to redefine honor 
        as caring about the consequences of our actions in the world, and as not 
        hypocritically mouthing the rhetoric of democracy when we take geopolitical 
        action. Not only should we care, because we can identify with grief felt 
        around the world. We must care--not as a rule of law, but as Barbara Kingsolver 
        puts it, as one of &#147;a hundred ways to be a good citizen, . . . to 
        look finally at the things we don&#146;t want to see.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        On September 11th our world changed. We Americans learned that we weren&#146;t 
        safe in our own country--whether we are warriors or peacemakers, whites 
        or people of color, men or women, gays or straights, legal or illegal 
        residents. All of us will suffer for the policies of the few in power. 
        But it doesn&#146;t have to be that way. This tragedy has produced a huge 
        awakening. We as a people have the opportunity now to change as well. 
        Instead of confirming the terrorists&#146; portrait of the U.S. as a bullying 
        superpower, we might still yet react unexpectedly, for example by beginning 
        to address real grievances in the region.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We might yet throw 
        ourselves into supporting sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine, 
        and stop now the bombing of Afghanistan, thereby being as good as our 
        word and proving to the Afghan people in our actions that we are not making 
        war against them. In this way, we might begin to defuse the reason that 
        young Arab men give their own lives to kill American civilians. Lederach 
        writes &#147;I believe that monumental times like these create conditions 
        for monumental change. . . . Let us choose democracy and reconciliation 
        over revenge and destruction.&#148; If we have not ruined already this 
        monumental chance for change by meeting violence with violence, that old 
        model of honorable blood vengeance, the terrible deaths we have suffered 
        will not have been in vain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Ghandi said, &#147;We 
        must be the change we wish to see in the world.&#148; Mary Oliver&#146;s

        on the feminist political agenda for years. It can't<br>
        just go away meekly now. It is agonizingly evident as of September 11 
        that there has been a paucity of women's voices from the political arena 
        (the world over) as well as in the arena of high public culture and discourse. 
        Something is missing. Hello?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One observes the

        But so few women. The talking head female folk on TV are a relief. Susan 
        Sontag and Maureen Dowd are a relief but there has got to be more female 
        leadership and articulation and input into the public discourse and decision-making

        &amp; more Amy Goodmans! Some alternative/corrective resource to power 
        of VOICE. How things are expressed, stated, conveyed whether it be condolence,

        of &quot;war&quot; &quot;education&quot; &quot;literacy&quot; (&amp; we

        And for whom? And to what purpose? Who is the language representing and

        us? We've had in the not so distant past genteel tyrannies of custom and 
        practice. It was a crime under slavery for African Americans to read and 
        write. Remember when a woman couldn't vote? When saying a liturgy or public

        on NAMING WHAT COUNTS AS REALITY. This seems more and more insane in a 
        universe with infinite possibilities. It doesn't need to be this way. 
        Of course we understand that gender is a social construct and that the

        model, Political representation began as the right of property-owning 
        MEN. Now the capitalist state addresses itself to a generalized citizen/consumer--presumably 
        classless, sexless, a hip citizen of the increasingly troubling world. 
        It's not working! Look at the mess we are in. Also to protect this &quot;version&quot; 
        of reality the<br>
        capital-driven state constructs its weapons of mass destruction with impunity 
        and threatens the very planet we dwell on by its greed for wealth and 
        power. We also see so many women suffering (unable to drive, get an education, 
        bare their faces in public, etc.) under other (in some cases less subtle) 
        regimes that are also constructing their weaponry and so on...The victims 
        of strife and war are also women.</font></p>

        &nbsp;The Challenge of Terror: A Traveling Essay <br>
        &nbsp;by John Paul Lederach</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So here I am, a week late arriving home, stuck between Colombia,<br>
        Guatemala and Harrisonburg when our world changed. The images flash even 
        in my sleep. The heart of America ripped. Though natural, the cry for 
        revenge and the call for the unleashing of the first war of this century, 
        prolonged or not, seems more connected to social and psychological processes 
        of finding a way to release deep emotional anguish, a sense of powerlessness, 
        and our collective loss than it does as a plan of action seeking to redress 
        the injustice, promote change and prevent it from ever happening again.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I am stuck from airport to airport as I write this, the reality of a<br>
        global system that has suspended even the most basic trust. My Duracell 
        batteries and finger nail clippers were taken from me today and it gave 
        me pause for thought. I had a lot of pauses in the last few days. Life 
        has not been the same. I share these thoughts as an initial reaction recognizing 
        that it is always easy to take pot-shots at our leaders from the sidelines, 
        and to have the insights they are missing when we are not in the middle 
        of very difficult decisions. On the other hand, having worked for nearly 
        20 years as a mediator and proponent of nonviolent change in situations 
        around the globe where cycles of deep violence seem hell-bent on perpetuating 
        themselves, and having interacted with people and movements who at the 
        core of their identity find ways of justifying their part in the cycle, 
        I feel responsible to try to bring ideas to the search for solutions. 
        With this in mind I should like to pen several observations about what 
        I have learned from my experiences and what they might suggest about the 
        current situation. I believe this starts by naming several key challenges 
        and then asking what is the nature of a creative response that takes these 
        seriously in the pursuit of genuine, durable, and peaceful change.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        SOME LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF OUR CHALLENGE<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        1. Always seek to understand the root of the anger - The first and<br>
        most important question to pose ourselves is relatively simple though<br>
        not easy to answer: How do people reach this level of anger, hatred and<br>
        frustration? By my experience explanations that they are brainwashed by 
        a perverted leader who holds some kind of magical power over them is an 
        escapist simplification and will inevitably lead us to very wrong-headed 
        responses. Anger of this sort, what we could call generational,<br>
        identity-based anger, is constructed over time through a combination of<br>
        historical events, a deep sense of threat to identify, and direct<br>
        experiences of sustained exclusion. <br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is very important 
        to understand, because, as I will say again and again, our response to 
        the immediate events have everything to do with whether we reinforce and 
        provide the soil, seeds, and nutrients for future cycles of revenge and 
        violence. Or whether it changes. We should be careful to pursue one and 
        only one thing as the strategic guidepost of our response: Avoid doing 
        what they expect. What they expect from us is the lashing out of the giant 
        against the weak, the many against the few. This will reinforce their 
        capacity to perpetrate the myth they carefully seek to sustain: That they 
        are under threat, fighting an irrational and mad system that has never 
        taken them seriously and wishes to destroy them and their people. What 
        we need to destroy is their myth not their people.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        2. Always seek to understand the nature of the organization - Over<br>
        the years of working to promote durable peace in situations of deep,<br>
        sustained violence I have discovered one consistent purpose about the<br>
        nature of movements and organizations who use violence: Sustain thyself. 
        This is done through a number of approaches, but generally it is through 
        decentralization of power and structure, secrecy, autonomy of action through 
        units, and refusal to pursue the conflict on the terms of the strength 
        and capacities of the enemy.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One of the most 
        intriguing metaphors I have heard used in the<br>
        last few days is that this enemy of the United States will be found in<br>
        their holes, smoked out, and when they run and are visible, destroyed.<br>
        This may well work for groundhogs, trench and maybe even guerilla<br>
        warfare, but it is not a useful metaphor for this situation. And neither<br>
        is the image that we will need to destroy the village to save it, by<br>
        which the population that gives refuge to our enemies is guilty by<br>
        association and therefore a legitimate target. In both instances the<br>
        metaphor that guides our action misleads us because it is not connected<br>
        to the reality. In more specific terms, this is not a struggle to be<br>
        conceived of in geographic terms, in terms of physical spaces and<br>
        places, that if located can be destroyed, thereby ridding us of the<br>
        problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly our biggest and most visible weapon 
        systems are mostly useless.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We need a new metaphor, 
        and though I generally do not like<br>
        medical metaphors to describe conflict, the image of a virus comes to<br>
        mind because of its ability to enter unperceived, flow with a system,<br>
        and harm it from within. This is the genius of people like Osama Ben<br>
        Laden. He understood the power of a free and open system, and has used 
        it to his benefit. The enemy is not located in a territory. It has<br>
        entered our system. And you do not fight this kind of enemy by shooting 
        at it. You respond by strengthening the capacity of the system to prevent 
        the virus and strengthen its immunity. It is an ironic fact that our greatest 
        threat is not in Afghanistan, but in our own backyard. We surely are not 
        going to bomb Travelocity, Hertz Rental Car, or an<br>
        Airline training school in Florida. We must change metaphors and move<br>
        beyond the reaction that we can duke it out with the bad guy, or we run<br>
        the very serious risk of creating the environment that sustains and<br>
        reproduces the virus we &gt;wish to prevent.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        3. Always remember that realities are constructed -<br>
        Conflict is, among other things, the process of building and sustaining<br>
        very different perceptions and interpretations of reality. This means<br>
        that we have at the same time multiple realities defined as such by<br>
        those in conflict. In the aftermath of such horrific and unmerited<br>
        violence that we have just experienced this may sound esoteric. But we<br>
        must remember that this fundamental process is how we end up referring 
        to people as fanatics, madmen, and irrational. In the process of name-calling 
        we lose the critical capacity to understand that from<br>
        within the ways they construct their views, it is not mad lunacy or<br>
        fanaticism. All things fall together and make sense. When this is<br>
        connected to a long string of actual experiences wherein their views of<br>
        the facts are reinforced (for example, years of superpower struggle that<br>
        used or excluded them, encroaching Western values of what is considered 
        immoral by their religious interpretation, or the construction of an enemy-image 
        who is overwhelmingly powerful and uses that power in bombing campaigns 
        and always appears to win) then it is not a difficult process to construct 
        a rational world view of heroic struggle against evil. Just as we do it, 
        so do they. Listen to the words we use to justify our actions and responses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And then listen to 
        words they use. The way to break such a<br>
        process is not through a frame of reference of who will win or who is<br>
        stronger. In fact the inverse is true. Whoever loses, whether tactical<br>
        battles or the &quot;war&quot; itself, finds intrinsic in the loss the 
        seeds that<br>
        give birth to the justification for renewed battle. The way to break<br>
        such a cycle of justified violence is to step outside of it. This starts<br>
        with understanding that TV sound bites about madmen and evil are not<br>
        good sources of policy. The most significant impact that we could make<br>
        on their ability to sustain their view of us as evil is to change their<br>
        perception of who we are by choosing to strategically respond in<br>
        unexpected ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take enormous courage and courageous<br>
        leadership capable of envisioning a horizon of change.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        4. Always understand the capacity for recruitment-The<br>
        greatest power that terror has is the ability to regenerate itself. What<br>
        we most need to understand about the nature of this conflict and the<br>
        change process toward a more peaceful world is how recruitment into<br>
        these activities happens. In all my experiences in deep-rooted conflict<br>
        what stands out most are the ways in which political leaders wishing to<br>
        end the violence believed they could achieve it by overpowering and<br>
        getting rid of the perpetrator of the violence. That may have been the<br>
        lesson of multiple centuries that preceded us. But it is not the lesson<br>
        from that past 30 years. The lesson is simple. When people feel a deep<br>
        sense of threat, exclusion and generational experiences of direct<br>
        violence, their greatest effort is placed on survival. Time and again 
        in<br>
        these movements, there has been an extraordinary capacity for the<br>
        regeneration of chosen myths and renewed struggle.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One aspect of current 
        U.S. leadership that coherently matches<br>
        with the lessons of the past 30 years of protracted conflict settings 
        is<br>
        the statement that this will be a long struggle. What is missed is that<br>
        the emphasis should be placed on removing the channels, justifications,<br>
        and sources that attract and sustain recruitment into the activities.<br>
        What I find extraordinary about the recent events is that none of the<br>
        perpetrators was much older than 40 and many were half that age.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is the reality 
        we face: Recruitment happens on a sustained<br>
        basis. It will not stop with the use of military force, in fact, open<br>
        warfare will create the soils in which it is fed and grows. Military<br>
        action to destroy terror, particularly as it affects significant and<br>
        already vulnerable civilian populations will be like hitting a fully<br>
        mature dandelion with a golf club. We will participate in making sure<br>
        the myth of why we are evil is sustained and we will assure yet another<br>
        generation of recruits.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        5. Recognize complexity, but always understand the power of<br>
        simplicity - Finally, we must understand the principle of simplicity. 
        I<br>
        talk a lot with my students about the need to look carefully at<br>
        complexity, which is equally true (and which in the earlier points I<br>
        start to explore). However, the key in our current situation that we<br>
        have failed to fully comprehend is simplicity. From the standpoint of<br>
        the perpetrators, the effectiveness of their actions was in finding<br>
        simple ways to use the system to undo it. I believe our greatest task 
        is<br>
        to find equally creative and simple tools on the other side.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Suggestions<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In keeping with the 
        last point, let me try to be simple. I<br>
        believe three things are possible to do and will have a much greater<br>
        impact on these challenges than seeking accountability through revenge.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        1.&nbsp; Energetically pursue a sustainable peace process to the<br>
        Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Do it now. The United States has much it<br>
        can do to support and make this process work. It can bring the weight 
        of<br>
        persuasion, the weight of nudging people on all sides to move toward<br>
        mutual recognition and stopping the recent and devastating pattern of<br>
        violent escalation, and the weight of including and balancing the<br>
        process to address historic fears and basic needs of those involved. If<br>
        we would bring the same energy to building an international coalition<br>
        for peace in this conflict that we have pursued in building<br>
        international coalitions for war, particularly in the Middle East, if 
        we<br>
        lent significant financial, moral, and balanced support to all sides<br>
        that we gave to the Irish conflict in earlier years, I believe the<br>
        moment is right and the stage is set to take a new and qualitative step<br>
        forward.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Sound like an odd 
        diversion to our current situation of terror?<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I believe the opposite is true. This type of action is precisely<br>
        the kind of thing needed to create whole new views of who we are and<br>
        what we stand for as a nation. Rather than fighting terror with force,<br>
        we enter their system and take away one of their most coveted elements:<br>
        The soils of generational conflict perceived as injustice used to<br>
        perpetrate hatred and recruitment. I believe that monumental times like<br>
        these create conditions for monumental change. This approach would<br>
        solidify our relationships with a broad array of Middle Easterners and<br>
        Central Asians, allies and enemies alike, and would be a blow to the<br>
        rank and file of terror. The biggest blow we can serve terror is to make<br>
        it irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing we could do is to feed it<br>
        unintentionally by making it and its leaders the center stage of what 
        we<br>
        do. Let's choose democracy and reconciliation over revenge and<br>
        destruction. Let's do exactly what they do not expect, and show them it<br>
        can work.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;2. Invest financially in development, education, and a broad<br>
        social agenda in the countries surrounding Afghanistan rather than<br>
        attempting to destroy the Taliban in a search for Ben Laden. The single<br>
        greatest pressure that could ever be put on Ben Laden is to remove the<br>
        source of his justifications and alliances. Countries like Pakistan,<br>
        Tajikistan, and yes, Iran and Syria should be put on the radar of the<br>
        West and the United States with a question of strategic importance: How 
        can we help you meet the fundamental needs of your people? The strategic 
        approach to changing the nature of how terror of the kind we have witnessed 
        this week reproduces itself lies in the quality of<br>
        relationships we develop with whole regions, peoples, and worldviews. 
        If we strengthen the web of those relationships, we weaken and eventually 
        eliminate the soil where terror is born. A vigorous investment, taking 
        advantage of the current opening given the horror of this week shared 
        by even those who we traditionally claimed as state enemies, is immediately 
        available, possible and pregnant with historic possibilities. Let's do 
        the unexpected. Let's create a new set of strategic alliances never before 
        thought possible.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;3. Pursue a quiet diplomatic but dynamic and vital support of<br>
        he Arab League to begin an internal exploration of how to address the<br>
        root causes of discontent in numerous regions. This should be coupled<br>
        with energetic ecumenical engagement, not just of key symbolic leaders, 
        but of a practical and direct exploration of how to create a web of ethics 
        for a new millennium that builds from the heart and soul of all<br>
        traditions but that creates a capacity for each to engage the roots of<br>
        violence that are found within their own traditions. Our challenge, as 
        I<br>
        see it, is not that of convincing others that our way of life, our<br>
        religion, or our structure of governance is better or closer to Truth<br>
        and human dignity. It is to be honest about the sources of violence in<br>
        our own house and invite others to do the same. Our global challenge is<br>
        how to generate and sustain genuine engagement that encourages people 
        from within their traditions to seek that, which assures the<br>
        preciousness and respect for life that every religion sees as an<br>
        inherent right and gift from the Divine, and how to build organized<br>
        political and social life that is responsive to fundamental human needs.<br>
        Such a web cannot be created except through genuine and sustained<br>
        dialogue and the building of authentic relationships, at religious and<br>
        political spheres of interaction, and at all levels of society. Why not<br>
        do the unexpected and show that life-giving ethics are rooted in the<br>
        core of all peoples by engaging a strategy of genuine dialogue and<br>
        relationship? Such a web of ethics, political and religious, will have<br>
        an impact on the roots of terror far greater in the generation of our<br>
        children's children than any amount of military action can possibly<br>
        muster. The current situation poses an unprecedented opportunity for<br>
        this to happen, more so than we have seen at any time before in our<br>
        global community.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        A Call for the Unexpected<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Let me conclude with simple ideas. To face the reality of well<br>
        organized, decentralized, self-perpetuating sources of terror, we need<br>
        to think differently about the challenges. If indeed this is a new war<br>
        it will not be won with a traditional military plan. The key does not<br>
        lie in finding and destroying territories, camps, and certainly not the<br>
        civilian populations that supposedly house them. Paradoxically that will<br>
        only feed the phenomenon and assure that it lives into a new generation.<br>
        The key is to think about how a small virus in a system affects the<br>
        whole and how to improve the immunity of the system. We should take<br>
        extreme care not to provide the movements we deplore with gratuitous<br>
        fuel for self-regeneration. Let us not fulfill their prophecy by<br>
        providing them with martyrs and justifications. The power of their<br>
        action is the simplicity with which they pursue the fight with global<br>
        power. They have understood the power of the powerless. They have<br>
        understood that melding and meshing with the enemy creates a base from 
        within. They have not faced down the enemy with a bigger stick. They did 
        the more powerful thing: They changed the game. They entered our lives, 
        our homes and turned our own tools into our demise.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        We will not win this struggle for justice, peace and human dignity <br>
        with the traditional weapons of war. We need to change the game again.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Let us take up the practical challenges of this reality perhaps<br>
        best described in the Cure of Troy,&nbsp;&nbsp;an epic poem by Seamus 
        Heaney, to loosen the grip of the cycles of terror. Let us give birth 
        to the<br>
        unexpected.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So hope for a great sea-change<br>
        On the far side of revenge.<br>
        Believe that a farther shore<br>
        Is reachable from here.<br>
        Believe in miracles<br>
        And cures and healing wells.<br>

        The email exchange, below, came out of an immediate and urgent need to 
        respond to recent terrorist events in the U.S. As members of the How2 
        Editorial Advisory Board began, spontaneously, to share their thoughts 
        with each other, it seemed clear that this sudden blow to our human psyche 
        had swiftly become the CENTRAL condition around which all thought/feeling 
        was flowing in us--privately and communally--and that in order to make 
        the How2 "postcard" email exchange relevant to our readers--to even imagine 
        anyone wishing to use it, at this moment--we would need to keep it deeply 
        connected to issues we are all worried about & thinking over within "the 
        continuous present" of writing. This may include the location of suppressed 
        questions that are not necessarily coming up in pre-defined and socially-pressured 
        public discourses (classrooms, bars, dinner tables, TV or radio shows--to/in 
        which we are witness &/or participant).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Excerpts from these 
        initial communiques have been put together, below, as both witness and 
        invitation to our readers to participate in this exchange of questions 
        and perspectives. One can imagine, for example, postcards from readers 
        who are teaching, describing useful written projects (with sharing of 
        selected results)-- ways of finding & making of written language acts 
        for overwhelming states of fear, grief, confusion or political scepticism.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">.... I am terrified, 
        numb, & aghast at my lack of language at this time. I want to explore 
        that feeling of lack. I feel deep rage about the discourse that is bombarding 
        us -- the military machine of cowboy rhetoric, the "dead or alive" bravado, 
        the ubiquitous image of the flag -- despair that I have no discourse to 
        oppose to it. No symbol to wear or hang from the windows, one that would 
        express grief & solidarity w/o yoking those to a jingoistic & hysterical 
        patriotism. I am enraged that an Islamic friend has stopped wearing her 
        head scarf for fear of her safety. That a colleague tells me that all 
        his dark-skinned, dark-haired students have shaved their beards & cut 
        their hair -- for safety. That the Morrocan family that runs 2 restaurants 
        in our neighborhood has the biggest & most plenteous flags at their establishments 
        -- for safety. I am enraged at the absence of a counter-symbol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I am grief-stricken 
        to hear the stories of a student who was trampled by the fleeing crowds, 
        who walked in bare feet all the way home to Queens, volunteered to take 
        blood donations for several days with no sleep or respite, & was then 
        yelled at in the subway for being "middle-eastern looking." Of another 
        who works fielding phone calls from the families of those missing & could 
        not control her sobbing. In a classroom. In that place. In that place 
        of words. I am appalled by their tears, I am exhausted, I am appalled 
        by my presence before them, I am speechless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I am stricken anew 
        this morning with the news that one of my students died in the attack. 
        She worked at a financial firm. I am appalled that she was at work while 
        I was at home. That for the last four years she was slowly earning her 
        BA in one evening course at a time. That this evening I must tell her 
        classmates</font></p>

        The city where I was born. I was on 7th Ave. and Greenwich Street when 
        one of the buildings collapsed and there was only the sound of thousands 
        of us in the street gasping as it tumbled. Our own human sound louder 
        than the structure's rumble. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....On Thursday 
        night, I went to the opening of a friend's art show. It was the opening 
        of her first major solo show and had been in the works for over a year. 
        Many of us attended just to see each other. I arrived at the space in 
        far west Chelsea (which can look like a war zone on the best of days) 
        to see my friends wearing surgical masks in the absolutely toxic smoke. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">But it was important 
        to see my friend's paintings. To see the attempt. Something good and full 
        of intention. Later in the week I was talking to this same painter friend 
        and she expressed disappointment that her show had gone ahead as very 
        few people have attended since that night and it is her first big show. 
        Then she began crying, saying, "why should I worry about something so 
        stupid?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> That is what it 
        has been like for me here. Feeling the fear (evacuated twice from locations 
        which were threatened after Tuesday), feeling shocked, ashamed, exhausted, 
        heartsick (walking past thousands of flyers with pictures of the "lost" 
        lining 11th Street all the way to St. Vincent's hospital) and then ricocheting 
        to concerns about the trivial and banal. Why can't I get below 14th Street 
        to the apartment where I am staying and get clean underwear? Why is this 
        bank line taking so long? Why did the woman put so much milk in my coffee 
        when I asked for "just a little?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ....My friend David 
        just phoned to see if I was going to a peace march tomorrow in Union Square. 
        I said, "Yes." He asked if I was bringing a sign but I have no sign to 
        bring. Nothing clever to say. Not one thing. I am so sad. People in the 
        street are sad and quiet here. No music blaring out of bodegas, no excited 
        conversation, not even many children yelling and playing. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">.... I was struck 
        by the fact that both Elizabeth Frost and Jo Ann Wasserman wrote about 
        their difficulty to define, to express, to find adequate words and symbols, 
        which now lie broken and useless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I think we should 
        try to find those words and symbols again (where? in the past? in ourselves? 
        in other cultures? should we create brand new ones?). Not logos, trademarks, 
        labels, slogans, badges, banners, allegories of death...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ...but, rather, 
        metaphors, words to cope with reality, attempts to understand and resist 
        interpretations--EVEN theories ("theory" being the 'bad' word few want 
        to hear in times of crises). But lack of theory is bad theory, and we--the 
        world--can't afford such a lack now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ...I&#8217;m trying to 
        express how these recent disasters have changed our relation to language. 
        Think of definitions given in the past few days: terrorist attack, permanent 
        global war, Holy War... (none of them seems proper)... and how everyone 
        is trying to cope with this void of language, working out responses that 
        generate from internal (psychological, but also physiological), external, 
        socio-cultural variations. Now those responses are floating and opaque; 
        sometime later they'll harden into definitions (the making of History). 
        I think that's a good reason for us to be watchful and keep on writing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And 'as life goes 
        on' I can't avoid thinking about the dozens of petitions I have signed 
        for years in defense of Afghan women, to expose their inhuman condition: 
        I wonder where those petitions landed, what we are to do for the forgotten 
        words.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> second excerpt from 
        Jo Ann Wasserman / NYC In response to Renata Morresi</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In response to Renata 
        Morresi, I agree that theory must move forward and is critical to our 
        sorting out process as we receive so much incorrect and non critical information 
        from the agents of mass media in the States. We certainly need sensitive 
        and revolutionary thinking right now. One thing that I was struck with 
        while attending the peace march last night was the insistent use (on the 
        part of the demonstrators) of dualistic language&#8212;"Bush wants war, New 
        York wants peace!" or "justice: yes, war: no!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> My friend and I 
        tried to start a round of "we feel scared" and "dignity for humanity" 
        (doesn't scan well, I know) to no avail. If theory and critical discourse 
        could help us to move outside of binary thinking (or defining) as that 
        which we are against, rather than for, it would be transformative. What 
        I want is to be defined as FOR something, not always against. Even in 
        listening to the chant, "Peace not war," I wondered, "what does peace 
        mean right now?" The way things were on September 10th in New York City 
        as thousands of people woke up living on the street? The way things were 
        in Macedonia last year? On the Gaza Strip today? In the Sudan? In Pakistan?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Last Tuesday night 
        I felt like there was no place to go and feel "safe" for the night. It 
        is a strange feeling for me but I know many around the world and in the 
        States experience that all the time. A thought flashed through my mind&#8212;I 
        wished it was New Year's Day so that I could attend the big, 24 hour marathon 
        poetry reading which takes place at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church 
        in New York City every year. I wanted to be there partly to be around 
        friends but also to be in a space of hearing poems, nonstop. I have been 
        thinking about the place poetry has in a situation like this one. How 
        the mysterious nature of that language might also be part of a response. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yesterday I heard 
        that On October 3rd there will be a group reading by about 50 poets (many 
        of whom are also critical writers) at St. Mark's. The idea is to respond 
        to recent events here. I don't know what people will read or say but I 
        am eager to find out. If anyone will be in NYC and wants specific info., 
        I would be happy to e-mail it out. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> from Ann Vickery 
        / Sydney, AU & Pennsylvania </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">....I have been thinking 
        about the strength of words and the strength of a symbol like the flag--there 
        may be little or no appropriate words at this time but there have been 
        plenty of flags. Flags have long been a potent symbol of solidarity and 
        mourning. I think back to how Cathy Freeman carried the Aboriginal flag 
        in both Olympic games, symbolically reminding all in Australia and the 
        rest of the world of her history and Aboriginal Australians' continuing 
        presence. Her gesture was far more effective than any sentence she might 
        have spoken. And it seems to me, that for many Americans, the American 
        flag has had a similar function at this point of time. I'm not suggesting 
        here that a minority Australian proudly showing her 'colour/s' to the 
        world (while her country's government still fails to acknowledge or say 
        'sorry' for past injustices) is the same as an average American showing 
        the flag in his/her own yard. But that the flag is an outward sign or 
        gesture of solidary, gesturing in the American case a sympathy towards 
        those most affected by the events of 9/11.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At the same time, 
        I also find it dissettling. I am now constantly reminded that I am an 
        "alien" in the United States, that as a sign of solidarity, it excludes 
        me. I've noticed too that many have begun wearing ribbons in the colours 
        of the flag in the same way as there were AIDS ribbons, and apparently, 
        Gulf war ribbons. As a symbol, I think the ribbon, like the flag, focuses 
        on it being an "American" tragedy, that it elides the many non-Americans 
        who died in the World Trade Center collapses and the suffering of their 
        families. I realize that the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were 
        targets precisely because they were American icons, but in reinforcing 
        it as simply an American tragedy, the use of the flag or its colours as 
        a symbol merely encourages the objectives of such terrorism--to heighten 
        national and cultural divisions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I think new approaches 
        to combatting terrorism must go beyond, as Jo Ann suggests, a simple dialectic 
        of peace vs. war, to some global coalition of the "civilized" against 
        an unknown other. More importantly, to actually rethink what the very 
        basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what it might 
        mean to be human today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How to relate this 
        to writing, I'm less sure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Lastly, I just wanted 
        to say how much I appreciated Renata's timely email about modernist writers 
        working through issues of politics and aesthetics in the face of fascism. 
        A different, though related set of issues, certainly arises in relation 
        to terrorism. Both, I think, are different again than the questions arising 
        in the face of a slow, sanctioned genocide such as occurred with the Holocaust, 
        arguably also happening in other parts of the world today. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am still confused, 
        and yet feel that I should finally somehow contribute to our exchange 
        about the terrible events of 2 weeks ago, even if I am relatively far 
        away in Germany, and have no one close in New York. Although my original 
        speechlessness has given way (had to give way) to efforts to talk with 
        my kids, my family, my friends, and colleagues, I am feeling a complete 
        inability to balance and to connect emotional and rational responses in 
        an acceptable way. I cannot manage this balancing act between (the expression 
        of) complete devastation, sadness, compassion, and helplessness on the 
        one hand, and an analysis of the political, historical, social, and religious 
        context on the other. But I am sure that it is this balancing act that 
        is most urgently needed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is needed because 
        the one without the other does not hold, or rather is extremely one-sided 
        if not dangerous. In Germany, at present, next to the hands on anti-terrorist, 
        measure-taking approach (be assured of U.S.anti-terrorist military support 
        + more police: cameras, security checks, screening etc.), the emotional 
        discourse (in words, gestures, actions, and symbols--all very material), 
        is the officially sanctioned one...as long as it is "for the U.S. not 
        against them." Hence my daughter and her classmates talked for hours in 
        class about the events per se, without any background information on Afghanistan, 
        Bin Laden, and/or the Middle East, but when a fellow student raised one 
        question about U.S. policy in the region, he was reprimanded and, for 
        the rest of the lesson, overlooked by the teacher who threatened to bring 
        him before the headmaster. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That two-thirds of 
        the former East German citizens--who have experienced their share of offical 
        binary interpretations of history and current events--are strongly opposed 
        to a war (on Afghanistan or any other "villain state") is mostly interpreted 
        as the expression of an insufficiantly developed sense of democracy and/or 
        latent anti-Americanism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Yesterday the culture 
        section of my local newspaper opened with a one page article on "The Cowardly 
        Thinking," claiming that German "artists and intellectuals flee into anti-American 
        prejudices." What the diverse intellectuals quoted there (in bits and 
        pieces, completely out of context) have done is: to put the events--in 
        Washington, New York and the Pittsburgh area--into a wider context of 
        US policy plus voicing the same fears of race hatred, vicious patriotism, 
        and militant jingoism that have been expressed in our e-mail discussion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The erronous logics 
        of a terrorism which takes the symbols of US global power (the World Trade 
        Center, the Pentagon) as material representation of the "evil" ("US imperialism") 
        and hence aggressively destroys them, is cynically repeated in a counter-attack 
        scenario (prescribed by the Bush government and followed by its allies, 
        Germany among them) which takes the very same symbols as material representation 
        of the "good" ("democracy", "civilization") as those to be aggressively 
        defended. It seems to me that the arbitrariness of symbols, the contextual 
        differences of meaning, the contingency of positions--historical, political, 
        social, gendered, ethnic, class-related--and the ambivalence of emotions 
        needs urgently to be thought about, talked about, written about before 
        and while re/acting to what undoubtedly was an onslaught on humanity, 
        a terrible, inhuman act.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> It is especially 
        hard to make (perceive and create an awareness of) a difference, or rather 
        to make differences in writing (the use of words and symbols) that subvert 
        the simplifying dominant discourse, when this very discourse is so emotionally 
        charged. And yet these differences need to be made, thought, spoken, and 
        written--risking the judgement of "cowardly thinking," rather than not 
        thinking at all.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We felt unsafe for 
        the next three days and never parted company, except to go to classes, 
        to teach, which was almost fruitless--on Thursday I cried, looking out 
        onto the tiny sea of my students to take attendance, just glad that they 
        were there. They were sobered, and we went on--I teach composition--and 
        learn we did. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> .... Basically, 
        I've been thinking, how would How2, if she could talk, want the Forum 
        to function? This is where we interpret her "constitution." While on the 
        one hand I value hearing intelligent women-poetry-thinkers critically 
        address all manner of issues--I love especially the way this forum, email, 
        lets those issues evolve, accelerate--I wonder how can this be brought 
        forward in a way that's true to How2's urgencies--to poetry and women? 
        And yet, oddly, Ann's suggestion that we need to "actually rethink what 
        the very basis of being civilized might mean or perhaps even more, what 
        it might mean to be human today" really urges me.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Perhaps that's not 
        so odd, though, when one considers how poetry is being cast about amidst 
        all the rhetoric of memorial and war in the U.S.. According to National 
        Public Radio, to be human and male is to write Poetry; to be female is 
        to talk and to grieve. Our only nationwide forum for news and culture, 
        NPR has brought poetry to the foreground, in the voices of Billy Collins, 
        Robert Pinsky, and, today, W.S. Merwin, offering profound reflection and 
        dour sentiments. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Women, when they 
        form audible words, sound in untrained yet eloquent prose. These are the 
        wives left behind. What NPR forms is an apparently unbridgeable sexually-differentiated 
        cultural divide. At what point do contemporary women enter to define a 
        national/poetic response? We stand, like Greek women outside the gates 
        of the polis, mourning. Olson said to Carolee Schneeman when she went 
        out to Gloucester with her then partner in the late 60s, that it was when 
        the cunts began to speak that Greek tragedy began its decline. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Anne Carson's fascinating 
        essay "The Gender of Sound" illuminates: "Greek women of the archaic and 
        classical periods were not encouraged to pour forth unregulated cries 
        of any kind within the civic space of the polis or within earshot of men. 
        Indeed, masculinity in such a culture defines itself by its different 
        use of sound." I've often wondered what stake male poets have/had in "masculinizing" 
        their practice, keeping it pure of certain (read "feminizing") emotions. 
        I'm not essentializing here (women write "emotional" poetry), but just 
        noticing how the burden of emotion is often pushed onto women while at 
        the same time this burden is used as an excuse to prohibit women's cultural 
        production, where culture is seen to proceed in a rational, or in some 
        sense formalized, manner.</font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear all,<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I too have hesitated 
        to speak about the terrible events in New York, and I<br>
        still do. I am grateful to those on the H2 EA Board who have spoken to 
        us. I<br>
        was fortunate to meet Elisabeth Frost when she came to England earlier 
        this<br>
        year, and I know I share much of her sorrow and anger at what has taken<br>
        place, and what is taking place.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I would also like 
        to add my immediate experience and thoughts, and perhaps<br>
        there will be opportunities later to come back to the wider questions.<br>
        It was a day when I was at home, fretting about the government's abolition<br>
        of the organisation I work for, and finishing an essay about performance 
        in<br>
        poetic collaboration. I was balanced between despair at national politics<br>
        and the pleasure of remembering a creative act with someone I felt very<br>
        close to. I think I had retreated from any wider community.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The only other person 
        in my flat was the man decorating my hallway, and <br>
        he was the first to tell me about the attack, as he had his radio on. 
        It was a <br>
        radiostation which seemed to play non stop 60s pop music, so I wasn't 
        quite sure<br>
        how to believe him. Later I went to the shop and people were talking about 
        it in<br>
        that excited unsure way of first hearing. I switched on the tv at lunchtime 
        and<br>
        the two of us watched the pictures and heard the commentary. For a while 
        it was <br>
        just stunning images on our tv sets: the collapse of the tower like an 
        <br>
        imploding rocket, reminding me of the space ship that failed. I think 
        <br>
        I said that it would solve nothing, and only harden attitudes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">He expressed various 
        standard prejudices about immigrants, culminating in<br>
        nostalgia for the loss of the empire. It was all so familiar and I just<br>
        refused to confirm his opinions. A friend rang to say that he wasn't sure<br>
        if he'd be able to get back to London, as he'd heard that they'd cordoned<br>
        London off. For a moment I worried if the decorator would be able to get<br>
        home. This turned out to be as much of a fiction as Americans believing<br>
        that the whole of Britain was cordoned off by foot and mouth. Nevertheless<br>
        it suddenly did seem much closer to home, and with threats of possible<br>
        attacks here, and for a while I scanned the news for statements about<br>
        London.<br>
        <br>
        The City was evacuated. The City in London means above all the stock<br>
        exchange, and a totally undemocratically governed area of London (although<br>
        it has jurisdiction and powers extending far beyond that), which has its<br>
        own cordon of security, and it is very hard for me to feel any connection<br>
        with it. The connection comes later, as it did with New York, when you<br>
        hear about the personal losses and tragedies. We have a history of bombing<br>
        in London in recent years, though nothing to compare with what has happened<br>
        in New York. We have hated institutions like the City, especially during<br>
        the Thatcher years. I live in an area where the bomb-making factories 
        were<br>
        concealed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the night when 
        the City was bombed, an Irish friend had<br>
        joined us for dinner and we were talking about the history of Ireland. 
        We<br>
        heard the explosion, but only later found out what it was. Although the<br>
        bomb was planted at night, there were victims, including local people 
        who<br>
        had nothing to do with the financial centres. We have become used to<br>
        living with possible terrorist attack, with frequent bomb scares before 
        the<br>
        Good Friday agreement, which now seems on the verge of collapse.<br>
        Like many others I fear for our civil liberties. The government is talking<br>
        about measures that were not even introduced during the IRA bombing<br>
        campaigns, and probably would have been ineffective anyway.<br>
        I also fear for our Asian population and for asylum seekers, who are<br>
        already treated inhumanely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are many causes 
        of fear on the streets in London, but many of us<br>
        believe that we fight against these things by not resorting to a police<br>
        state, but by strengthening our communities. On the Tuesday evening I 
        went<br>
        to our housing coop meeting - an ill attended event usually these days. 
        I<br>
        wanted to escape from the endless replay of television. There were more<br>
        people than I'd expected, and some that had returned to the meeting after 
        a<br>
        long absence. Next year we celebrate 25 years of the coop's existence.<br>
        Today I saw the headline, &quot;Bush sends plan of military action&quot;, 
        and for a<br>
        moment I read it as &quot;Bush ends plan of military action&quot;.<br>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">excerpt from Arielle 
        Greenberg / Boston </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two issues I face 
        here and now: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1) Spinning off of 
        Linda Kinnahan's remarks about what it means to be an innovative writer 
        who is also political: How to be a non-narrative poet in the face of such 
        REAL, linear surreality, you know? I don't even WANT to write about it 
        all, but it's the only thing I AM writing about, in one way or another, 
        and I feel slightly irresponsible for going sideways/non-linear rather 
        than being directly story-telling about it all. To this end, I am planning 
        to read Celan, whom I think of as a brilliant avant-garde reporter of 
        very direct and personal tragedy. Can anyone suggest other poets who have 
        done this, especially women poets?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 2) I am also thinking 
        a lot about what it means to be a global citizen. I am not so naive as 
        to think that America can or should pull out of all foreign policy...at 
        this point that's simply not realistic, nor is it generous. So how can 
        a country like the USA use its power for good instead of evil? How can 
        I be a part of urging it to do so?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I want to also note, 
        in regard to Linda K's comment about Pinsky (whom I almost always find 
        self-righteous), that I did hear a pretty good alternative to the voice 
        of HIStory when Boston's NPR call-in show, "The Connection," had a day 
        dedicated to the uses of poetry at times like these, and guests were Marie 
        Howe and Naomi Shahib Nye.... One of my favorite moments on that show 
        was when the (male) host brought Nye on the line, and instead of either 
        Howe or Nye addressing the questions at hand-- or the host--Nye said, 
        "Hello, Marie, I have been thinking of you in New York" and Howe said, 
        "Hello, Naomi darling, I have been thinking of you." Such a human--and, 
        dare I say, female--moment.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Dear all<br>
        I have been reading your thoughtful messages with gratitude, and with 
        admiration for such articulate reflections. Many of the sentiments expressed 
        echo my own--in particular my feelings of frustration and powerlessness--but 
        I am made hopeful by the determination of everyone involved in this correspondence 
        to make sense of their lives, and to plan for future action--be it the 
        re-reading of Celan, the writing of new poetry, the raising of issues 
        in HOW2, or meeting up at the Modernism conference. (I wish I could be 
        there). Ann's suggestion for the rethinking of 'what the very basis of 
        being civilized might mean...what it might mean to be human today' ties 
        in with my own concern regarding our (my) lack of understanding of how 
        such inhumane acts come to be perpetrated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I was in China on 
        the 11th, in an area where we unable to receive CNN News, or indeed any 
        other English-speaking channel. Rumours abounded, and to see the TV images 
        with no commentary or explanation was terrifying. I rang my daughter in 
        London, and she told me what she knew of events. As we spoke, news reports 
        were coming in on her TV from the USA. She told me that a White House 
        spokesman was about to appear, and asked--did I want to hear what he was 
        saying? Hungry for any information, I replied in the affirmative and she 
        held the telephone receiver close to the TV. It was not what he said that 
        made me weep, but just that I suddenly became aware--in that moment--of 
        the distance that separated me from those I loved, of the enormity of 
        the atrocities that had been committed in New York and Washington, and 
        that what I was hearing formed just one small part of a historic unfolding 
        which could lead to more violence and unimaginable suffering throughout 
        the world. That feeling has not abated. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A response to 
        "erotics" [featured in reading/s How2/5] Against/Grain </b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All poetry is an 
        erotics insofar as it is about tension and texture. Intimacy implies a 
        thorough knowledge of a limited body while that body continually renews 
        itself. The tension of the known occurs while stumbling upon unexpected 
        comminglings: collage: one atop another. Eros invites us to enter the 
        dim mystery of a pattern. It is a pattern, however, that is animate. The 
        known defies the familiar, so fluid. These contradictions of lived experience 
        arouse. Tension doesn't so much release as give, against itself, permissions. 
        Contra-Dictions. The body sometimes needs to go against the grain in order 
        to perceive the grain. So there's a gorgeous, voluptuous obstinacy in 
        pronouncing the unsayable. What is more palpable--breath, saliva, &c--than 
        the blurring of boundaries. These many forms, 'figurative' and literal, 
        make up the pattern of some shifting whole. So a body of work resounds 
        and resides with a body of desire. As desire beckons with its ultimately

        <b>A 4-way conversation, collaged from emails between "postcard" editor, 
        Kathleen Fraser, and three readers</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>between KF and 
        Kelly Everding, Art Director <i>Rain Taxi</i> </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>KF's question/ 
        1/18/01</b>: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You write: "I am 
        an MFA grad from ten years ago (a survivor of sorts) who has forsaken 
        the academic life for something less volatile. I am a woman poet who is 
        primarily influenced by male poets--particularly surrealist poets--and 
        it's hard to shake that." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These two sentences 
        are the basis of a book! But meanwhile, why don't you read the "forum" 
        in H2/n4, currently on-line through February, and see if you have any 
        response to any of it from your position of having chosen to give up the 
        academy. If anything burbles up, just write it into an email and maybe 
        we can get some discussion going among other readers. It seems that many 
        women remain quite timid around entering the public arena... and must 
        be lured in, i.e. given very particular invitations. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I wonder what this 
        is about....I'm puzzled why more women don't respond to the "bait" of 
        having a place to write responsively from any perspective or style they 
        choose. I've really wanted the unspoken questions of "taste-making," selection 
        of what gets into print, and the on-going questions of power relations 
        to have a place to be sorted-out in this journal....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I'm curious where 
        you did your MFA work? In the early '70s, I taught for two years at the 
        Iowa Writers Workshop--as well as a year at Reed College--before landing 
        at SF State University...and find myself very interested in how you've 
        described your academic experience as "volatile"--sufficiently so, to 
        lead you to give it up... . </font></p>

        1/22/01 </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I will definitely 
        look deeper into the layers of the H2 site and maybe get up the courage 
        to contribute. I was struck by what you said in your last email about 
        women needing to be lured in--I think I follow that behavior. I am timid 
        and every piece of writing needs to be almost beaten out of me. I resist 
        the work of writing, but once I am in it, I love it. I don't know if it's 
        a self-esteem thing or what--probably. Being outside academia, I sometimes 
        don't feel qualified to make any statements or judgements. I have definitely 
        left that high-critical language behind. Would I sound dumb? Not in the 
        know? These are the personal demons I struggle with and sometimes overcome 
        by writing ... Every new review is a new accomplishment, something new 
        to learn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I received my MFA 
        from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.... It was harrowing at 
        times, but the best thing about it was meeting close friends whose relationships 
        really helped to shape my writing life more than the classes or teachers. 
        Some of these same friends are here in Minneapolis, so we continue the 
        discussion and mutual celebration of poetry and writing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Please check out 
        Rain Taxi's new online edition, recently posted (www.raintaxi.com). I 
        have a review there of a book on Jean Painleve, a science filmmaker who 
        was a friend to the surrealists and really pioneered science films, shooting 
        underwater footage and such. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the way, our RT 
        website has had a link to How2 since our inception. Eric Lorberer (the 
        editor) knew about H2 and has great respect for it....so many avenues 
        of information. The great thing about web sites are their non-linear structure, 
        a sort of Big Bang theory of expansion as one link takes you to another, 
        one interest sparks another. H2 definitely shows the care and time you've 
        spent on it--I really like the old B&W pictures of modernist women writers 
        as well as the minimalist and clean white look of it. . </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Dear Kelly, You'd 
        be surprised at how your feelings and situation speak for so many!!! The 
        push/pull around going public that you describe is an all-pervasive problem 
        many are up against. Recently, several H2 readers' private emails spoke 
        of the anxiety of writing beyond a small circle of friends and also of 
        the various traumas of grad school--who/what is voiced vs. what remains 
        unvoiced...both in grad school and after, feeling a bit anxious to have 
        one's actual experience or thinking revealed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the way, if you 
        are into film, you might enjoy writing about some female-directed (or 
        authored) surrealist or modernist film/s??? Did you see the interviews 
        we did of filmmakers Pelle Lowe (H2/3) and Yvonne Rainer (H2/4)? I see 
        film and its construction as very interrelated to the project of constucting 
        the modernist and contemporary inventions of/interventions into that thing 
        called "poem". Why don't you work on a visual/word piece for the mixed 
        media section for issue 6 (since n5 is just about to go on-line, end of 
        Feb., under the new Editorship of Ann Vickery. (I'll still be doing the 
        "postcard" selection.) Think about it...you could use photos, art work, 
        written responses both longer and shorter...It could be fun! </font></p>

        1 /10 /01</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> ...if I hadn't thought 
        to invite you (as now clarified) to write a response to an "under-appreciated" 
        book (or books) you are currently fascinated by, would you have thought 
        to ever send in something to How2 on your own?? Would it have felt risky 
        in any way? Would you have felt prohibited? Unconsciously waiting for 
        a personal and specific invitation? I ask because I've been struck by 
        the fact that in over 2 years of editing H2, the only persons initiating 
        "reviews" have been male, even though I thought H2 was proferring an open 
        invitation... Clearly we've not yet adequately understood a missing piece 
        of the puzzle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Are we looking at 
        habit, here, or something more?? I assumed that if the place was created 
        and the descriptions of/invitations to different sections clear enough, 
        the space would be used very actively. Not true. It is in precisely this 
        area that work still needs to be done to further open up the range of 
        styles and voices --poets who might be interested in and willing to write 
        about their own takes on what they are reading, instead of leaving it 
        entirely up to the academic scholar/critics--many of whom are brilliant 
        and inventive, others who read, rather exclusively, from the perspective 
        of a very specific training & set of categories tending to leave out work 
        that doesn't "fit".... Daunting. . </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>MB's response/ 
        1/12/01:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As for whether I 
        would have sent work without prompting...I am no doubt too reticent for 
        my own good in unleashing my work on the world, a result of my abiding 
        ambivalence, whether learned or innate. I haven't yet managed to balance 
        my particular needs for privacy, focus, and modesty, with the authoritativeness 
        or exoticism that seem to be required for a public literary identity. 
        But then again some of that comes from the indifference with which the 
        work is often greeted. My ambitions are conflicted and not infrequently 
        discouraged. I've invested too much in feminist/leftist critique to say 
        that my reticence is just a function of my personality. On the other hand 
        I've been slow to engage that critique in a way that would bring my work 
        into a more public discourse. Yes, I've been afraid to be a more public 
        writer; have maybe kept my work more subjective, private.... Which has 
        left me with the dissatisfying feeling of being outside of any public 
        dialogue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> But my version of 
        what a public, political discourse might be may not be recognizable to 
        some. I'm suspicious of much conspicuously "political" writing and its 
        potential for dogmatism and reductiveness. I find politics in the subtle, 
        solitary acts of perception and the formation of cognitive structures 
        for apprehension and response. But the subtlety, the minutia, of such 
        activities may result in work that seems inert rather than arresting. 
        Or so I conclude, as I seem often to find myself mouthing inaudibly amidst 
        a thunderous din. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Undeniably a "specific 
        and personal invitation" is a motivation to enter the fray. It's exactly 
        that kind of interest that brings a sense of the work being relevant to 
        an audience, of its being a part of the larger writing/reading/ thinking 
        world. I'm not one of those who's been able to convince myself of a work's 
        relevance without some sign from the outside. To a certain degree, I think 
        my writing project is about this very thing: the (often vexed) relationship 
        between the very private subject and the seemingly remote power vectors 
        that shape the social world. While the duality of private/ public is discredited 
        these days, I need to retain some distinction like that to understand 
        what's at stake in taking part in a public dialogue. </font></p>

        been fascinated with for a while...longing for a chance to engage with 
        one particular piece. That piece seems to fit in with my on-going obsessions 
        about landscape, space, and grids, dynamics, and connections . . . I'm 
        very flattered to be asked to contribute to H2! I much enjoyed delving 
        into the archives of HOW(ever) when I was researching Barbara Guest's 
        work. It's so good to have all that material available on the web--I'd 
        been wanting to see copies of the original journal for a long time--and 
        have been following How2 ever since. .</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I don't know how 
        to write about all this. Struggling with the gender issues has been very 
        very painful for me here, and now that things seem to be improving somewhat, 
        I'm a bit loathe to reopen old wounds!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> There are some real 
        practical issues for me that account for my not sending materials to How2 
        and not speaking up in on-line formats that I'd like to touch on. But 
        most importantly, I have to find a way of writing about the politics of 
        women's connections with each other that is truthful (but not over-revealing) 
        of the particulars of my situation, yet at the same time avoids giving 
        the impression that I think it's just "my problem" ...for the subject 
        is extremely important.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Thank you for giving 
        me the chance to see the other email contributions to this "postcard" 
        correspondence. The questions raised make me think about all kinds of 
        _practical_ reasons why someone like me doesn't make good use of forums 
        that seem ready-made for speaking-out, even those as welcoming as How2. 
        More on this later in this discussion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I also need to find 
        a way to write "in public" about the kinds of issues you and I have discussed 
        in earlier emails. (Even revealing a previous one-on-one discussion feels 
        problematic!) I can see _your_ frustration, coming across verbalized anxieties 
        (issues) that often tangle us up in women's writing and scholarship --but 
        not being able to persuade us to write about them in a form we'll allow 
        to be made public. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The feeling that 
        it's "just me" is part of ithe problem, of course. It's not so much that 
        I always think my point-of-view isn't worth listening to, or that it doesn't 
        deserve to be heard. (To my surprise, I often feel quite confident about 
        my views, though of course that creates its own pressures.) The basic 
        issue is that I am the only woman in my program to voice dissatisfaction--consistently 
        and somewhat openly--about its gender politics. The program I am currently 
        a part of is one that has constructed its identity on the basis of oppositionality, 
        and requires that its students be loyal dissenters in supposedly hostile 
        territory: "If you're not for us; you're against us." So the intellectual 
        climate is very much"the fray" that Mary mentions, rather than any kind 
        of open arena or protected zone! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A seemingly "open 
        space" is created that is full of invisible barriers. The odd thing is 
        that when someone bumps up against one of these, s/he becomes amazingly 
        and embarrassingly visible, fully clothed in whatever kind of identitarian 
        outfit suits the occasion. "Ah, we have a woman among us... (substitute 
        whatever other label you like). How nice that you can speak up!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In other classes 
        that I attend, issues of race, class, gender, sexuality come and go as 
        seems required by the subject under discussion and it isn't always left 
        to the "other-identified" (as opposed to "self-identified") minority to 
        speak up for themselves about whatever "their" issues are judged to be. 
        While theory can certainly be misused as a debating tool--i.e., "I have 
        a bigger, more famous, currently cooler theorist to apply to this issue 
        than you do!"--it can also provide a framework that, because it is somewhat 
        depersonalized, can allow push/pull and debate that goes beyond identitarian 
        boxing-in. This is what I see happening in the best of the classes that 
        I attend outside my own program. The risk, of course, with that kind of 
        approach is that "speaking from experience" can get censored-out. In classrooms 
        where I do feel comfortable enough to speak up, I try to take a pride 
        in speaking from experience as well as theory. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sitting in a room 
        full of smart, interesting people who consistently ignore certain kinds 
        of extremely important issues or assigned readings, and knowing that unless 
        "my" kind of person raises them they won't be raised--whereas, if I do 
        speak up, I'll be assumed to be speaking just because I am that kind of 
        person--is not only appallingly silencing, but also excruciatingly frustrating. 
        I leave the room and feel utterly drained with the effort of (not) speaking. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It also feels very 
        lonely. The obvious answer to the situation I'm describing is for a group 
        of the "whatever" kind to get together and speak up and support each other. 
        But here I find myself in another kind of quandary that is particularly 
        hard to talk about in this context. One of the very sad things about all 
        this, especially for me, given the wonderfully supportive female community 
        I had while getting my MFA, was to see how the women here get split apart 
        and almost set against each other. For various personal (?) reasons, few 
        have seemed prepared to rock the boat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A difficulty for 
        me in this situation is handling inter-generational feminist divides. 
        From my experience here, the woman student who is "non-traditional" (in 
        this context, older returning students) doesn't have much authority in 
        the lit crit or poetry classroom, She is, I suspect, seen as boring, mumsy, 
        and worst of all, "essentialist".</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Most perplexing 
        of all, if she also declares herself to be a feminist (how old-fashioned!), 
        she obviously hasn't read (as indeed I haven't--I was hoping for a class 
        here that would provide it!) the historical sequence of first-wave, second-wave, 
        etc., feminisms. It is very clear to me that in my program, women (among 
        other groups) are are not in a situation that encourages them to speak 
        up about issues that aren't on the currently "mainstream" agenda." To 
        say anything in the classroom--or to individuals, privately--that would 
        even hint at this observation would be seen as patronizing. How dare I 
        speak for someone else and make them look weak and naive? (As I write 
        this, I notice--and resent--the twist I find myself putting on all this: 
        not "this situation is bad," but "here's why this situation is so hard 
        for me".) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I know that none 
        of this will be news to many women. It's just been a big lesson to me--my 
        hardest seminar last year was probably "gender politics". Having spent 
        so much of my work life, and then in my MFA program among highly articulate 
        and competent women scholars and professors, I came to realize that up 
        to that time, I'd been very sheltered in professional situations. Even 
        at work when, as happened not infrequently, I found myself "the only woman" 
        (certainly often the only college-educated one, and hence an anomaly!), 
        in business meetings, I never felt I was speaking "as a woman" (hence 
        boxed-in)...as has happened to me here. I was an oddity, but there was 
        respect for oddities, especially if they had some technical expertise. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of course I have 
        had some support, especially in private. But the worst hostility I encountered 
        here came after a few of us dared--openly-- to put together a publicly 
        identifiable united front. I now restrict myself to minimal appearances 
        at poetry arenas (though that subject is what I came here to do!), and 
        feel much more confident now that I'm not constantly exposing (or not 
        exposing!) myself. There have been some changes in the last year, though, 
        and more women have been entering this program, which has to be a good 
        thing! I can see some differences happening, as a result of that--I notice 
        that women's issues are discussed more...but still, from what I hear, 
        this happens mainly at the instigation of the women in the room. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">About my difficulty 
        in expressing any of this in public (as opposed to privately): that awkward 
        business of seeming to speak for other people. How dare I do that? I worry 
        that perhaps I have got it all wrong, after all? What right _have_ I got 
        to voice an opinion, especially a public one? I badly need to know that 
        I've got it "right" . . . as if such a thing were entirely possible!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I actually feel 
        deeply anguished at being told that I've "misunderstood" or that I just 
        "don't get it". . . I can find a certain confidence (mentioned earlier), 
        but I know it's a bit of an act. Because it's an act, it feels easily 
        under-minable, and at the same time, I worry about its staginess and its 
        (necessarily?) forceful rhetoric, and the effect that this has on the 
        truthfulness of what I am saying?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I find that a good 
        deal of my best thinking is done through poetry, and I believe that this 
        is because there I am able to be truthful about the difficulties inherent 
        in writing--anything at all. That feels much more honest!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Before signing-off, 
        I wanted to say something very quickly about some of the practical things 
        that stop me from taking part in this kind of public debate. First there 
        must be time and effort! This is the third or fourth occasion in the last 
        8 months or so that I've done this kind of writing. In each case, I felt 
        I just had to get something out, forcefully, and fast. Email is very pressurized--listserves 
        particularly so, and particularly competitive, too. Get something out 
        now! Jump in before the next person! A practical side of me says, yes, 
        this is the only way to do this, while you're burning hot with the issue, 
        while there's interest in it, an occasion for it. But this fights with 
        the side of me that says, this is not how effective work is done. You 
        have to be able to edit, to have time to write and come back fresh to 
        revise. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The occasion was 
        there, the issues demanded it, and I felt fired-up and desperate to make 
        myself heard. But this is actually the hardest and most challenging kind 
        of writing I ever do. Far harder than writing academic papers! It feels 
        like running a race, or taking a very tightly timed exam. How best to 
        do justice to the occasion (and the people involved), and my anger, and 
        to be truthful to my insights and intuition, and at the same time be as 
        persuasive and clear as I can? Even done all in one day (as this current 
        piece is), it takes up huge amounts of time and emotional energy. Today, 
        I've put aside some long-overdue grading, just to give this thing the 
        time it needs, including going through its various layers: first emoting, 
        then trying to get to some more rational-sounding structure, some attempt 
        at balance (no one wants to sound shrill, or whiny), then editing for 
        diplomacy's sake (after all, this thing is public!).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Re being invited--that 
        certainly makes a big difference! But even then, and even given less emotionally 
        fraught material, it's genuinely difficult to make the time. Even you 
        had to ask me twice for a book review last year, and I was so thrilled 
        to be asked!! As I'm sitting here typing I'm trying not to look at a second 
        reminder to send some poems to a magazine. I guess, having the space to 
        speak may not be enough. (After all, the frustrating classrooms I've described 
        certainly looked open enough to begin with!) I need invitations, structure, 
        something to bounce off, and the emotional resources that will help me 
        key myself up to speaking-up and ignoring my other commitments! I don't 
        think well on my feet; would much rather take things away and look at 
        them quietly, digest them a bit, and then come back and say my piece. 
        But frustratingly, my current lifestyle won't let me do that. Really a 
        very basic aspect to being shut up! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'm actually very 
        very angry that graduate school (in its PhD form) shuts me away from all 
        kinds of what I characterize as connecting, feminine parts of me --keeping 
        up with and being supportive to friends and family, taking part in exchanges 
        like this. I absolutely don't think the either/or sacrifice is a necessary 
        part of the choice, and I think it's especially hard on women!! Sorry 
        to go on and on about this--it's a very sore point right now. Add the 
        fear that I have in this place, isolated as I am, of cutting myself off 
        even more, and perhaps you have an answer to some of your questions?</font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Film in the works 
        I thought you and your readers would like to know about a documentary 
        film on Zora Hurston for the Public Broadcasting System with major grants 
        from PBS, the NEA and the NEH. This project has been a "work in progress" 
        for ten years, which probably says more about me than it does about the 
        project. But it's now in full-swing and I think it will be an exciting 
        piece just because Hurston is such a fascinating character -- and we've 
        filmed interviews with folks who have since passed on (Dorothy West for 
        instance) who have inner perspectives. The script was co-written by Julie 
        Dash and myself -- my co-producer is Sam Pollard, one of the "Eyes on 
        the Prize" producers as well as a film editor for Spike Lee. We anticipate 
        a PBS broadcast in late Spring 2002. The films focus will be Zora's anthropological 
        work as a platform for her fiction, for her life and politics. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to the 
        film, Carla Kaplan is editing a collection of Zora's letters which was 
        to have been published this year but isn't out yet -- Valerie Boyd is 
        writing a biography which is to come out within the year -- and the Hurstons 
        are due to release a book of their own about their family. I found some 
        folktales at the Smithsonian that the Hurstons want to publish but I don't 
        know when that might happen. So there are many of the written word types 
        of publications going on with Hurston. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your web site looks 
        interesting. I'm going to tell a writerly friend about it because it looks

        project</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> I'd like to invite 
        readers of How2 to contribute to a collaborative web project, the Doll 
        Games. <a href="http://www.poetrykit.org/ezines.htm">http://www.ineradicablestain.com/dollgames</a>. 
        My sister and I began this project to document the perverse and elaborate 
        doll games we played as children, and that remains the core of the project. 
        The Doll Games has several layers: we tell true stories, and include bonafide 
        evidence that survives from those times (miniature books and letters "written 
        by" our dolls), but we also footnote and theorize in a faux-academic manner, 
        and address readers through a fictive and Kinbote-like editor. But this 
        "scholarship" is slippery in tone: it's funny, but sometimes we mean it. 
        The whole project sits uneasily between fiction and documentary, and that's 
        the way we like it. (I am a writer, best known as the author of the acclaimed 
        hypertext 'novel' Patchwork Girl; my sister is an independent scholar 
        with a PhD in rhetoric from UC Berkeley, so this hybrid work is a kind 
        of amalgam of our interests.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is an ongoing 
        project, and it's still in an early stage. Right now it revolves around 
        our own doll games, but over time, we hope the site will expand to include 
        a vast section of contributions from other women (though we will we welcome 
        men too) who have good stories to tell about their own childhood doll 
        games. (Our note to contributors is located at <a href="http://www.poetrykit.org/ezines.htm">http://www.ineradicablestain.com/dollgames/question.html</a>) 
        Because I suspect many of your readers are academics, however, I hope 
        some of them will feel moved, as we were, to subtly spoof their own disciplines--under 
        a pseudonym, if that seems liberating! </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Laura Riding's 1930 
        work <i>Though Gently</i> mixes prose, verse, and aphorism into a coherent 
        analysis of the crisis of gender in the new humanism, American democracy's 
        ascendant geo-political power, and English poetry's infatuation with the 
        avant garde. Printed in a run of 200 copies, the text was slightly flawed, 
        and the book never reprinted. In 2001, the Laura Riding centenary, <i>Delmar</i> 
        magazine will reprint a correction of the original text, along with responses 
        to it by poets and critics, Riding scholars and<i> Delmar</i>'s past-contributors. 
        The work received absolutely no attention in its initial commercial life.<i> 
        Delmar</i> then invites the participation in this project of interested 
        Riding readers. Responses of under 2500 words must be submitted by December 
        31, 2000. For more information, or for those interested who need a copy

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I just tried to get 
        current issue of HOW2 off of my computer at home using Microsoft search 
        engine--and using the www address on its own--and each time I ended up 
        with page showing #3 as current issue??? At the University using the same 
        procedures, I get page showing #4 as current issue. I have no idea why 
        this is happening? My computer at university is more powerful--but I have 
        a fairly good computer at home, too--and in both cases am using UW internet 
        services, so. . . --Jeanne Heuving, U. of Washington (Bothell/Seattle)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Jeanne, I've just 
        tried searching for HOW2 through numerous search engines. One of them 
        (Yahoo!) turned up an archived issue (on the Rutgers webserver). All the 
        other searches turned up the correct one. When I searched through Lycos, 
        I found the current issue when searching Lycos, Infoseek, Northern Light, 
        Dogpile, Google, Ask Jeeves, Alta Vista, Direct Hit, HotBot, Go.com. In 
        all cases How2 appeared within the first page of results, and often it 
        was first or second. This looks pretty healthy to me, so I'm not sure 
        I need to do anything to "fix" it. Jeanne, if there's something I'm overlooking, 
        please let me know. --Roberta Sims</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jeanne, Could you 
        try emptying the cache on your browser? Every time you load a web page, 
        your computer stores a temporary version of that page so that if you call 
        it up again, it will load faster. Your webserver at work might be regularly 
        emptied, but you have to empty it manually at home. If you use Internet 
        Explorer, click on "TOOLS," then "INTERNET OPTIONS." In the middle it 
        says: Temporary Internet Files. Click on "Delete Files," then click the 
        "okay" at the bottom If you use Netscape, chose "EDIT" then "PREFERENCES." 
        On the left side, at the bottom, it will say "ADVANCED." Click on the 
        Plus sign beside advanced. Click on the word "CACHE." Click on the button 
        that says "CLEAR MEMORY CACHE," then click "OK". Now click on the button 
        that says "CLEAR DISK CACHE" and click "OK." Click "OK" one more time.
