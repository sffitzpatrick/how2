        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          pictures in the chapbook <i>Love and Illustration</i> have their history 
          in a fascination with the visual aspects of the letter o and with its 
          numerical presence in the alphabet. An o, to my mind, is primitive and 
          elegant, more than it appears to the eye. In its numerous semiotic correspondences, 
          o is easily seen to be <i>of</i> imagination’s subtle image/medium relationships. 
          The letter’s recombinant qualities -- as the form is reduced, enlarged, 
          segmented -- are, among all the letters of the alphabet, unique. O’s are 
          simple, balanced figures; at the same time, they are paradoxically full 
          and empty, one and many; neutral and expressive. The form, o, seems to 
          be, basically: code.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">          
          *   *   *</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Robert 
          Duncan, in a statement of his poetics, refers to important influences 
          on his writing as “<i>virtus,</i>” supernatural or divine powers. As o’s 
          have made a claim on my imagination, they have linked me to other writers. 
          Fascinations held in common have become <i>virtus </i>for these illustrations.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          first <i>virtu</i> that comes to mind is the power that is in syllables 
          and phonemes. It is found in the Gospel’s “In the beginning was the Word” 
          and in the myths of Orpheus. Then there is the Hasidic tale in which, 
          in a world made of sound, the Rebbe loses concentration and, making the 
          sacred sounds out of order, creates a monster.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Second, 
          o’s, in the context of these illustrations, take on the qualities of the 
          miniature and the toy. Their adaptations evoke childhood play as Giorgio 
          Agamben refers to it in <i>Infancy and History</i>:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A look 
            at the world of toys shows that children, humanity’s little scrap-dealers, 
            will play with whatever junk comes their way, and that play thereby 
            preserves profane objects and behaviour that have ceased to exist. Everything 
            which is old, independent of its sacred origins, is liable to become 
            a toy. What is more, the same appropriation and transformation in play 
            (the same <i>illusion</i>, one could say, restoring to the word its 
            etymological meaning, from <i>in-ludere</i>) can be achieved -- for 
            example, by means of miniaturization. . . . The essential character 
            of the toy -- the only one, on reflection, that can distinguish it from 
            other objects -- is something quite singular, which can be grasped only 
            in the temporal dimension of ‘once upon a time’ and a ‘no more’ . . 
            . [pp. 70-71, trans. Liz Heron, Verso, London, New York, 1993]</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another 
          <i>virtu</i> is a childhood love of picture books and pleasurable memories 
          of being read to. What linked hearing and seeing was mysterious. Later, 
          when I read to myself, I could enter a between-state in which I arranged 
          different picture/text combinations. When there was a time lapse between 
          the text and picture -- for instance, when a plate showing Hansel and 
          Gretel walking through the woods dropping crumbs on the path appeared 
          pages later at the moment when in the story the witch is showing the children 
          the oven -- narrative linearity was displaced by a new formal essence.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          fourth power at work in this chapbook is Velimir Khlebnikov’s notebooks 
          on syllables and phonemes. A nineteenth century Russian Cubo-Futurist 
          poet, Khlebnikov was also a mathematician, natural scientist, and linguist. 
          He believed language to be basic to human organization and in his notebooks 
          developed a protolanguage that he was convinced would initiate world harmony. 
          He kept notebooks on syllables, assigning them numbers and attributes, 
          and a book of number nouns in which numbers were assigned to actions from 
          which he composed manifestos and poems.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Pattern 
          in nature and in art is another <i>virtu</i>. There is the idea that the 
          phenomenal world is composed of only a few basic patterns (see Luis Borges’ 
          <i>The Craft of Verse</i>, Gertrude Stein’s early writings on human typology, 
          and Peter Stevens’ <i>Patterns in Nature</i>). Sometimes I am surprised 
          by patterns that come up as I write. Or are they just amazing coincidences? 
          One makes its way into <i>Love and Illustration</i>, which links my experience 
          of a first word with one recalled by Walter Benjamin in “A Berlin Chronicle.” 
          In Benjamin’s memoir, the word was “love” and came to him at the age of 
          three. In mine the word was “romance” and was experienced at about the 
          same age, before I could speak. For Benjamin, the setting was in a Tiergartenstrasse 
          park close to the Hohanzollern labyrinth:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At that 
            time, it is true, it must have corresponded more than closely to what 
            was waiting behind it, for here, or not far away, were the haunts of 
            that Ariadne in whose proximity I learned for the first time (and was 
            never entirely to forget) something that was to make instantly comprehensible 
            a word that at scarcely three I cannot have known: love. [trans. Edmund 
            Jephcott, Schocken Books, New York, 1978, p. 4]</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          my memory, I was in our apartment in Brookline, Massachusetts on a back 
          porch glassed in for an extra room. The word rose in response to a view 
          of something “romantic” seen outside -- a boy and girl, ten or eleven 
          years old, wrestling and laughing in a snowbank. The word “romance” was 
          exhaled as a single breath onto the glass where in the cold air it condensed 
          into an o that stood for the unpronounceable word and its scene.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          <i>Love and Illustration</i>, the raw feeling of living in a world taken 
          apart is put to use in the deconstructions that o’s permit. The book is 
          given an ending that replaces “romance” and “love” with a third word, 
          “devotion” in the recounting of a Russian folktale, <i>The Beautiful Vasilisa</i>. 
          Devotion drives this tale as a love that is present without name. As well 
          as being beautiful and courageous, Vasilisa carries in her pocket a gift 
          presented to her by her mother on her deathbed -- a talking doll. With 
          the doll’s magic powers on her side, the girl manages to bring light to 
          the village from the hut of Baba Yaga, the witch who has day and night 
          under her control. The girl’s cleverness, goodness and beauty capture 
          the prince’s attention and they marry, fulfilling the tale’s romantic 
          ending. “As for the doll,” the tale says, “Vasilisa carried it around 
          in her pocket until the day she died.”</font></p>
