        <p style='line-height:200%;'><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lucy:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          I was very excited to open <i>Book of The Fur</i> and dissect it. I love 
          the way that you have spliced together images with text, and the way that 
          different modes of narrative were stitched together and pulled apart. 
          It is a bizarre and crazily ambitious project for a first book-length 
          work but it hangs together really elegantly. Can you tell me a bit about 
          how the project came into being?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          I was interested in trying to experiment with types of writing that might 
          actually be furry. I am interested in the concept of fur on a number of 
          levels: it is the space between skin and the outside and it is also something 
          which occupies an in-between space. It is something that is comforting 
          at the same time as being quite disgusting.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy: 
          </b>I love the way in which language is pulled and tugged around in the 
          book to reveal tensions and rips and flaws. The way language operates 
          as surface, revealing flashes and glimpses of bloodiness and flesh as 
          well as the discarded elements of fat, bone, and eyeball. It seems like 
          a depiction of the way in which words are stitched together during the 
          writing process and how elements are excised or scraped away. Can you 
          tell me a bit about the process of writing <i>Book of The Fur</i>?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell: 
          </b>I took lots of source material from old-fashioned books on fur trapping 
          and processing. I amassed a huge amount of material but ultimately I did 
          tend to choose texts relating to parts of the process after the animals 
          had been caught, at the point at which the raw material is changed through 
          a mixture of skill and artifice into apparently glamourous commodities. 
          I was struck by the gruesome processes involved at the same time as being 
          intrigued by the extraordinary vocabulary that completely obliterated 
          the actual history of the origin of the furs. All of which had become 
          lost in the dictionary tables of terminology and the long descriptions 
          of dyeing the furs to make them look as if they had come from more rare 
          and therefore more expensive animals. That is what the last section is 
          about, “for Australian Seal read Rabbit/for Baffin Seal read Rabbit/for 
          Baltic Leopard read Australian Rabbit...” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          Yes, I enjoyed the romance of names such as ‘Seal Musquash,’ ‘Royal Pastel,’’Bluerette’ 
          and ‘Sapphire.’ They are names that mask the whole process of trapping 
          and slaughtering. It seems to show a reliance on romantic brand names 
          that are completely at odds with the actual animal fur used.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Exactly.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy: 
          </b>Could you say a bit about how the diagrams and pictures work with 
          the text?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          The diagrams and pictures were taken from much of the source material 
          I was using; books on fur trapping I found in the British Library, pamphlets 
          on treating fur, on wild cats, on how to make beaver hats...</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          Obviously you are intending to make the pun on beavers and female anatomy?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, on not being able to represent directly sexuality because of the 
          ease with which it could be simulated back into a very different type 
          of exploitative text. But I suppose this question of exploitation/recuperation 
          is the very thing that I am trying to address in the work.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          And is this important in terms of your use of images and diagrams?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, to the extent that I wanted the pictures and diagrams to work in 
          a way that gave a literal context to the writing at the same time as unsettling 
          that context. Obviously the poem isn’t about beavers, foxes and rabbits. 
          It’s about sexuality and the packaging of it—the fluctuating gap between 
          the natural and the commodified.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          There is something strange and uncanny about the way these coats and furry 
          objects exist as a result of the slaughter of a living creature. There 
          is the obvious point about the sentimentality associated with animals 
          being killed for their fur, but there is also the sense that this is actually 
          a fetish object. Taking something that for one creature has an ontological 
          function (in being crucial to its very existence) and translating it into 
          another thing that, for another creature, is function defined by form, 
          pure appearance dictated by commodity value and status. How do these issues 
          relate to your writing?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Well, I suppose that I was interested in this ‘uncanniness’ that you are 
          mentioning in the sense of a fetishization of an object which is also 
          a loss of recognition. I’ve been reading Julia Kristeva’s <i>Powers of 
          Horror</i> and thinking about how she defines the abject as “a failure 
          to recognise its kin.”(5) To wear fur is not to recognise it as belonging 
          to another living thing. I wanted to relate this gap to the position of 
          women’s practice in language and art which might itself be a state of 
          abjection. I wanted to explore the possible flip-side to this apparently 
          negative position. Kristeva is defining a conceptual position that she 
          describes as a kind of “vortex of summons and repulsion [which] places 
          [the] one haunted by it literally beside [her]self.”(1) I think that using 
          such a range of source material does place you beside oneself. A writing 
          that is already half someone else’s or that quite obviously belongs elsewhere 
          seems to me to offer quite an interesting position from which to begin 
          an investigation, to acknowledge those previous contexts and see where 
          it leads.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          There is something else too, in this metaphor of furriness and its theft 
          or displacement. The way in which poetry itself involves a process of 
          slaughter or flaying. Something about the directions or meanings of words 
          and phrases that are lost, disrupted or sacrificed in the process of creating 
          a poetic text: the blood on the cutting room floor. The series of little 
          deaths that occur in the text and inevitably make up its meaning.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, related to that I suppose I was conscious of a number of ghosts haunting 
          the writing of it, especially Meret Oppenheim’s fur covered tea cup. The 
          narrative interventions that punctuate the text are taken from a catalogue 
          describing how she got the inspiration to make that piece. I’m interested 
          in its status as a very ambiguous object that is both a symbol of desire 
          and loss, particularly a loss of functionality.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          Yes, Oppenheim’s work has an obsessiveness about it that I can feel coming 
          across in <i>Book of the Fur</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          I’m glad about that. I actually use some of the words and phrases from 
          her poetry near the end of the book. A kind of perverse homage that involved 
          the ‘flaying’ of the work from the more obvious modernist clichés that 
          are threatening to engulf it and representing it as snippets of pronoun 
          drama and phrases literally caught from parts of her sentences. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          I like the way that your text manages to sustain the reader through a 
          range of different approaches or assaults on the idea of furriness, skin, 
          blood, and gore. As a female reader I loved the grotesque kitsch of it: 
          fashion combining with victimisation; the gore involved in putting on 
          war paint; the self-inflicted wounding through ear piercing, hair plucking, 
          waxing, and shaving; the sense of disgust involved in the process of beautification, 
          titivation.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, I started reading about the history of fur garments and imagining 
          all these parallels between writing and clothing. In my mind there became 
          a connection between the whole history of writing on parchment that used 
          to be the hide of an animal—the skin of something—and the history of fur 
          and representations of female sexuality. Did you know it wasn’t until 
          the twentieth century that people started wearing fur on the outside of 
          their clothes? Until then it had been worn on the inside. Similarly, there 
          is a right and a wrong side for writing on parchment. The wrong side is 
          hairy. I was wondering if women writers might be on the hairy/furry side 
          of writing and what it might be like to try and write a text that acknowledged 
          this furriness.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          How did this relationship between language and fur, between the metaphorical 
          blank white space and the hairiness of the page of parchment, have a formal 
          impact on the work?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell: 
          </b>Sometimes in a quite literal way, as in the section beginning, “kith 
          nomenclature...” which has long lines that run on and on. There I was 
          trying to mimic diagrams of diagonal seams used to join pieces of fur 
          together in finished garments. At other times it has more to do with an 
          overall texture created by the degree to which the source material is 
          assimilated or sticks out, like bristles I suppose!</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          The way in which you think about fur in relation to language and the theft 
          or colonisation of the function and space of the other reminds me a lot 
          of the work of Susan Howe. She is concerned with the devastating impact 
          of European settlers on the American landscape and has explored the emergence 
          of an American text that both reflects and conceals this impact. Are you 
          interested in Susan Howe and some of the other American writers undertaking 
          this kind of investigation?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Very much so. I am interested in the way Susan Howe uses source texts 
          in her work, allowing the original context to show through, from under 
          the page as it were. Her use of the page as a visual space is extraordinary. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          I was thinking also of the way in which she reconstitutes a silenced or 
          excised moment or person (such as Mary Rowlandson) in relation to your 
          exploration of the figure of Meret Oppenheim?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, I hadn’t thought of it in that way but yes, I find that a fascinating 
          aspect of her writing; the way in which she is able to represent these 
          voices and people apparently lost to history without pretending to speak 
          through them in some kind of fictionalised construction.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          also met Joan Retallack last year when she was visiting England and I 
          really enjoyed talking to her about different approaches to the writing 
          process. Similarly, I’m interested in Carla Harryman and Leslie Scalapino 
          because of their use of narrative, narratives which often involve the 
          abject in some way.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Lucy:</b> 
          It seems to me that these are all writers who are very concerned with 
          the ethics of writing and language. The relation between writing and female 
          sexuality is one of the really gripping metaphors of this book. I like 
          the questions it raises about the occurrence of prettiness, glamour and 
          excess in the form and content of the writing. The ethical dimension of 
          an aesthetic of practice is obviously important to you?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Redell:</b> 
          Yes, and I think I’ve come to a better understanding of that through carrying 
          out the project. At first all I knew was that I wanted to write in a way 
          which had the formal qualities of fur. The more research I did into fur 
          handbooks, the PETA website, etc., it became less easy to use the metaphor 
          in a theoretical or abstract way without addressing the materiality of 
          fur and its history. I couldn’t just appropriate it out of its context. 
          There was also a lot in the media at the time. <i>The Guardian</i> ran 
          a headline, ‘COMPASSION IS SO LAST YEAR,’ followed by a description of 
          the fashion industry’s revival of fur on the catwalks. I didn’t want to 
          write the poetic equivalent of that so I had to take on board more than 
          the fluffy abstraction of writing as fur that perhaps I started off with.
