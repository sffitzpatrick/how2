<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>WORK/BOOK</b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy Sheerman discusses <i>Book of The Fur</i> 
  with its writer Redell Olsen. </b></p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> I was very excited to open <i>Book of 
  The Fur</i> and dissect it. I love the way that you have spliced together images 
  with text, and the way that different modes of narrative were stitched together 
  and pulled apart. It is a bizarre and crazily ambitious project for a first 
  book-length work but it hangs together really elegantly. Can you tell me a bit 
  about how the project came into being?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> I was interested in trying to experiment 
  with types of writing that might actually be furry. I am interested in the concept 
  of fur on a number of levels: it is the space between skin and the outside and 
  it is also something which occupies an in-between space. It is something that 
  is comforting at the same time as being quite disgusting.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy: </b>I love the way in which language is 
  pulled and tugged around in the book to reveal tensions and rips and flaws. 
  The way language operates as surface, revealing flashes and glimpses of bloodiness 
  and flesh as well as the discarded elements of fat, bone, and eyeball. It seems 
  like a depiction of the way in which words are stitched together during the 
  writing process and how elements are excised or scraped away. Can you tell me 
  a bit about the process of writing <i>Book of The Fur</i>?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell: </b>I took lots of source material from 
  old-fashioned books on fur trapping and processing. I amassed a huge amount 
  of material but ultimately I did tend to choose texts relating to parts of the 
  process after the animals had been caught, at the point at which the raw material 
  is changed through a mixture of skill and artifice into apparently glamourous 
  commodities. I was struck by the gruesome processes involved at the same time 
  as being intrigued by the extraordinary vocabulary that completely obliterated 
  the actual history of the origin of the furs. All of which had become lost in 
  the dictionary tables of terminology and the long descriptions of dyeing the 
  furs to make them look as if they had come from more rare and therefore more 
  expensive animals. That is what the last section is about, &#8220;for Australian Seal 
  read Rabbit/for Baffin Seal read Rabbit/for Baltic Leopard read Australian Rabbit...&#8221; 
</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> Yes, I enjoyed the romance of names 
  such as &#8220;Seal Musquash,&#8221; &#8220;Royal Pastel,&#8221; &#8220;Bluerette&#8221; and &#8220;Sapphire.&#8221; They are 
  names that mask the whole process of trapping and slaughtering. It seems to 
  show a reliance on romantic brand names that are completely at odds with the 
  actual animal fur used.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy: </b>Could you say a bit about how the diagrams 
  and pictures work with the text?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> The diagrams and pictures were taken 
  from much of the source material I was using; books on fur trapping I found 
  in the British Library, pamphlets on treating fur, on wild cats, on how to make 
  beaver hats...</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> Obviously you are intending to make 
  the pun on beavers and female anatomy?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, on not being able to represent 
  directly sexuality because of the ease with which it could be simulated back 
  into a very different type of exploitative text. But I suppose this question 
  of exploitation/recuperation is the very thing that I am trying to address in 
  the work.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> And is this important in terms of your 
  use of images and diagrams?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, to the extent that I wanted the 
  pictures and diagrams to work in a way that gave a literal context to the writing 
  at the same time as unsettling that context. Obviously the poem isn&#8217;t about 
  beavers, foxes and rabbits. It&#8217;s about sexuality and the packaging of it&#8212;the 
  fluctuating gap between the natural and the commodified.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> There is something strange and uncanny 
  about the way these coats and furry objects exist as a result of the slaughter 
  of a living creature. There is the obvious point about the sentimentality associated 
  with animals being killed for their fur, but there is also the sense that this 
  is actually a fetish object. Taking something that for one creature has an ontological 
  function (in being crucial to its very existence) and translating it into another 
  thing that, for another creature, is function defined by form, pure appearance 
  dictated by commodity value and status. How do these issues relate to your writing?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Well, I suppose that I was interested 
  in this &#8220;uncanniness&#8221; that you are mentioning in the sense of a fetishization 
  of an object which is also a loss of recognition. I&#8217;ve been reading Julia Kristeva&#8217;s 
  <i>Powers of Horror</i> and thinking about how she defines the abject as &#8220;a 
  failure to recognise its kin.&#8221;(5) To wear fur is not to recognise it as belonging 
  to another living thing. I wanted to relate this gap to the position of women&#8217;s 
  practice in language and art which might itself be a state of abjection. I wanted 
  to explore the possible flip-side to this apparently negative position. Kristeva 
  is defining a conceptual position that she describes as a kind of &#8220;vortex of 
  summons and repulsion [which] places [the] one haunted by it literally beside 
  [her]self.&#8221;(1) I think that using such a range of source material does place 
  you beside oneself. A writing that is already half someone else&#8217;s or that quite 
  obviously belongs elsewhere seems to me to offer quite an interesting position 
  from which to begin an investigation, to acknowledge those previous contexts 
  and see where it leads.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> There is something else too, in this 
  metaphor of furriness and its theft or displacement. The way in which poetry 
  itself involves a process of slaughter or flaying. Something about the directions 
  or meanings of words and phrases that are lost, disrupted or sacrificed in the 
  process of creating a poetic text: the blood on the cutting room floor. The 
  series of little deaths that occur in the text and inevitably make up its meaning.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, related to that I suppose I was 
  conscious of a number of ghosts haunting the writing of it, especially Meret 
  Oppenheim&#8217;s fur covered tea cup. The narrative interventions that punctuate 
  the text are taken from a catalogue describing how she got the inspiration to 
  make that piece. I&#8217;m interested in its status as a very ambiguous object that 
  is both a symbol of desire and loss, particularly a loss of functionality.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> Yes, Oppenheim&#8217;s work has an obsessiveness 
  about it that I can feel coming across in <i>Book of the Fur</i>.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> I&#8217;m glad about that. I actually use 
  some of the words and phrases from her poetry near the end of the book. A kind 
  of perverse homage that involved the &#8220;flaying&#8221; of the work from the more obvious 
  modernist clich&#8217;s that are threatening to engulf it and representing it as snippets 
  of pronoun drama and phrases literally caught from parts of her sentences. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> I like the way that your text manages 
  to sustain the reader through a range of different approaches or assaults on 
  the idea of furriness, skin, blood, and gore. As a female reader I loved the 
  grotesque kitsch of it: fashion combining with victimisation; the gore involved 
  in putting on war paint; the self-inflicted wounding through ear piercing, hair 
  plucking, waxing, and shaving; the sense of disgust involved in the process 
  of beautification, titivation.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, I started reading about the history 
  of fur garments and imagining all these parallels between writing and clothing. 
  In my mind there became a connection between the whole history of writing on 
  parchment that used to be the hide of an animal&#8212;the skin of something&#8212;and the 
  history of fur and representations of female sexuality. Did you know it wasn&#8217;t 
  until the twentieth century that people started wearing fur on the outside of 
  their clothes? Until then it had been worn on the inside. Similarly, there is 
  a right and a wrong side for writing on parchment. The wrong side is hairy. 
  I was wondering if women writers might be on the hairy/furry side of writing 
  and what it might be like to try and write a text that acknowledged this furriness.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> How did this relationship between language 
  and fur, between the metaphorical blank white space and the hairiness of the 
  page of parchment, have a formal impact on the work?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell: </b>Sometimes in a quite literal way, as 
  in the section beginning, &#8220;kith nomenclature...&#8221; which has long lines that run 
  on and on. There I was trying to mimic diagrams of diagonal seams used to join 
  pieces of fur together in finished garments. At other times it has more to do 
  with an overall texture created by the degree to which the source material is 
  assimilated or sticks out, like bristles I suppose!</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> The way in which you think about fur 
  in relation to language and the theft or colonisation of the function and space 
  of the other reminds me a lot of the work of Susan Howe. She is concerned with 
  the devastating impact of European settlers on the American landscape and has 
  explored the emergence of an American text that both reflects and conceals this 
  impact. Are you interested in Susan Howe and some of the other American writers 
  undertaking this kind of investigation?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Very much so. I am interested in the 
  way Susan Howe uses source texts in her work, allowing the original context 
  to show through, from under the page as it were. Her use of the page as a visual 
  space is extraordinary. </p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> I was thinking also of the way in which 
  she reconstitutes a silenced or excised moment or person (such as Mary Rowlandson) 
  in relation to your exploration of the figure of Meret Oppenheim?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, I hadn&#8217;t thought of it in that 
  way but yes, I find that a fascinating aspect of her writing; the way in which 
  she is able to represent these voices and people apparently lost to history 
  without pretending to speak through them in some kind of fictionalised construction.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'>I also met Joan Retallack last year when she was 
  visiting England and I really enjoyed talking to her about different approaches 
  to the writing process. Similarly, I&#8217;m interested in Carla Harryman and Leslie 
  Scalapino because of their use of narrative, narratives which often involve 
  the abject in some way.</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Lucy:</b> It seems to me that these are all writers 
  who are very concerned with the ethics of writing and language. The relation 
  between writing and female sexuality is one of the really gripping metaphors 
  of this book. I like the questions it raises about the occurrence of prettiness, 
  glamour and excess in the form and content of the writing. The ethical dimension 
  of an aesthetic of practice is obviously important to you?</p>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><b>Dell:</b> Yes, and I think I&#8217;ve come to a better 
  understanding of that through carrying out the project. At first all I knew 
  was that I wanted to write in a way which had the formal qualities of fur. The 
  more research I did into fur handbooks, the PETA website, etc., it became less 
  easy to use the metaphor in a theoretical or abstract way without addressing 
  the materiality of fur and its history. I couldn&#8217;t just appropriate it out of 
  its context. There was also a lot in the media at the time. <i>The Guardian</i> 
  ran a headline, &#8220;COMPASSION IS SO LAST YEAR,&#8221; followed by a description of the 
  fashion industry&#8217;s revival of fur on the catwalks. I didn&#8217;t want to write the 
  poetic equivalent of that so I had to take on board more than the fluffy abstraction 
  of writing as fur that perhaps I started off with. </p>
