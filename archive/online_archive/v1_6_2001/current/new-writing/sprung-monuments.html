          I painted especially for the <i>Poetry Plastique </i>show, includes lines 
          and fragments of poems by Charles Bernstein. We have collaborated on five 
          books together: <i>The Occurrence of Tune</i> (Segue, 1981), <i>The Nude 
          Formalism</i> (Sun &amp; Moon, 1989), <i>Fool’s Gold </i>(Chax, 1991), 
          <i>Little Orphan Anagra</i>m (Granary Books, 1997), and <i>Log Rhythms</i> 
          (Granary Books, 1998). In addition, I have done several artist’s books 
          on my own and have a new collaborative book with the poet Susan Howe, 
          <i>Bed Hangings,</i> forthcoming in 2001 from Granary Books. Notably, 
          although painting is my main preoccupation, this is the first time I have 
          incorporated lines from Charles’ poetry into one of my paintings. </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Over 
          the years, I have painted many works with images alone. Since 1996, I 
          have occasionally incorporated titles and blurbs from B-movie and film 
          noir movie posters and slogans and titles from pulp novels into various 
          paintings. Text alters the framework for the images and repositions the 
          viewers in relation to the paintings. In <i>Sprung</i> <i>Monuments,</i> 
          I have reset excerpts of several of the poems I had previously set in 
          <i>Little</i> <i>Orphan Anagram</i> and <i>Log Rhythms.</i></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          settings in the painting are different from those in the books. Here I 
          have used the absurdist humor and mock or perhaps all-too-real profundity 
          of the line, “Poetry fakes nothing happening,” to show a man rained down 
          on by relentless trickles of enamel paint as the cloud encompassing this 
          thought nears him. Meanwhile, the poem “My son is going dumb I would pluck 
          out my neighbor’s tongue if it would do any good” forms an oval shield 
          of words over the man’s belly, suggesting that these are the thoughts 
          of a worried father. “His wife she stood with a loaded gun,” the bungled 
          quotation from Emily Dickinson (“My Life had stood-a Loaded Gun-”), is 
          framed by an errant 1940s woman watching her lover escape from an open 
          window, as well as a postcard of a loving 1950s father hanging a horseshoe 
          over his family’s door frame. The visual framing positions the text in 
          the space between family and seduction, sexual longing, and family values. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          images in the painting touch on the humorous, mystical, whimsical, science 
          fictional, surreal, and philosophic underpinnings of the poems. But each 
          panel of the painting puts forward its own interpretation. Sometimes the 
          images focus on just one word of the poem and sometimes they stand in 
          a stark contrast to the poem. I am not interested in a strict illustrational 
          approach to the words but rather an oblique associative relation between 
          image and poem.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          image is an echo and an accompaniment of the poem. Much like writing music 
          to a libretto—the words and the music stand in inverse relationship to 
          each other. In setting these poems however, I am also interested in legibility. 
          The poems float in a clouds, bubbles, and rocks, sometimes they are encased 
          in linear boxes.  They become part of the artificial landscape created 
          by the gridded space of the painting. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Each 
          of these poems is set in its own space. I also think of these small scenes 
          as a storyboard or cartoon frames or as fragments of the whole. As the 
          poem puts it: “The parts are greater that the sum of the whole.” This 
          applies to the use of details in the painting. The painting can be viewed 
          in close-ups as a highly detailed reading of the individual lines of the 
          poems or a whole, where the fragments of a puzzle fall into place to lend 
          the appearance of a false unity. This unity is created by the painted 
          and collaged surface of the grid and is held together by the boundaries 
          of the stretched canvas.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          is also my sense of the relationship between the artist and the poet who 
          collaborate together. The poems and images form a larger symbiosis that 
          enhances the interpretation of the synthetic whole. Thus, the idea of 
          “poetry plastique” is an interpretative visualization of the underlying 
          abstract imagery and mood and emotions of the poems. Particularly, when 
          dealing with ironic, dense, and open-ended poems like Charles’s, I feel 
          free to provide my own interpretive response.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Different 
          poets suggest different approaches to collaboration. For example, in setting 
          the poems of Susan Howe in <i>Bed Hangings,</i> I felt more directed by 
          the poem’s historical subject matter: Puritans, religion, colonial America, 
          fabric design, and textiles. All of these were of major importance to 
          the interpretation and imagery of the pictures and so my images centered 
          upon them. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          collaborations between poets and visual artists, I feel that the artist 
          should match the wavelength of her or his artistic intuition and vision 
          to the intensity and demands of the poet’s words. It is a challenge and 
          pleasure to be able to form visual reponses to overpowering verbal stimulants. 
          Some of my inspirations have been the medieval illuminated pages, the 
          books of William Blake and William Morris, as well as the work of Max 
          Ernst, John Heartfield, and Hannah Höch. But, most of all, the amazing 
          ability of writers to conjure up whole worlds of images with their words 
          continues to fascinate and inspire me to follow suit with a visual response.
