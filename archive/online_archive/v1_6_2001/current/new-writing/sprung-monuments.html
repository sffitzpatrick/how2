        Monuments, </font></i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">which 
        I painted especially for the <i>Poetry Plastique </i>show, includes lines 
        and fragments of poems by Charles Bernstein. We have collaborated on five 
        books together: <i>The Occurrence of Tune</i> (Segue, 1981), <i>The Nude 
        Formalism</i> (Sun &amp; Moon, 1989), <i>Fool’s Gold </i>(Chax, 1991), 
        <i>Little Orphan Anagra</i>m (Granary Books, 1997), and <i>Log Rhythms</i> 
        (Granary Books, 1998). In addition, I have done several artist’s books 
        on my own and have a new collaborative book with the poet Susan Howe, 
        <i>Bed Hangings,</i> forthcoming in 2001 from Granary Books. Notably, 
        although painting is my main preoccupation, this is the first time I have 
        incorporated lines from Charles’ poetry into one of my paintings. </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Over 
        the years, I have painted many works with images alone. Since 1996, I 
        have occasionally incorporated titles and blurbs from B-movie and film 
        noir movie posters and slogans and titles from pulp novels into various 
        paintings. Text alters the framework for the images and repositions the 
        viewers in relation to the paintings. In <i>Sprung</i> <i>Monuments,</i> 
        I have reset excerpts of several of the poems I had previously set in 
        <i>Little</i> <i>Orphan Anagram</i> and <i>Log Rhythms.</i></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        settings in the painting are different from those in the books. Here I 
        have used the absurdist humor and mock or perhaps all-too-real profundity 
        of the line, “Poetry fakes nothing happening,” to show a man rained down 
        on by relentless trickles of enamel paint as the cloud encompassing this 
        thought nears him. Meanwhile, the poem “My son is going dumb I would pluck 
        out my neighbor’s tongue if it would do any good” forms an oval shield 
        of words over the man’s belly, suggesting that these are the thoughts 
        of a worried father. “His wife she stood with a loaded gun,” the bungled 
        quotation from Emily Dickinson (“My Life had stood-a Loaded Gun-”), is 
        framed by an errant 1940s woman watching her lover escape from an open 
        window, as well as a postcard of a loving 1950s father hanging a horseshoe 
        over his family’s door frame. The visual framing positions the text in 
        the space between family and seduction, sexual longing, and family values. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        images in the painting touch on the humorous, mystical, whimsical, science 
        fictional, surreal, and philosophic underpinnings of the poems. But each 
        panel of the painting puts forward its own interpretation. Sometimes the 
        images focus on just one word of the poem and sometimes they stand in 
        a stark contrast to the poem. I am not interested in a strict illustrational 
        approach to the words but rather an oblique associative relation between 
        image and poem.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        image is an echo and an accompaniment of the poem. Much like writing music 
        to a libretto—the words and the music stand in inverse relationship to 
        each other. In setting these poems however, I am also interested in legibility. 
        The poems float in a clouds, bubbles, and rocks, sometimes they are encased 
        in linear boxes.  They become part of the artificial landscape created 
        by the gridded space of the painting. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Each 
        of these poems is set in its own space. I also think of these small scenes 
        as a storyboard or cartoon frames or as fragments of the whole. As the 
        poem puts it: “The parts are greater that the sum of the whole.” This 
        applies to the use of details in the painting. The painting can be viewed 
        in close-ups as a highly detailed reading of the individual lines of the 
        poems or a whole, where the fragments of a puzzle fall into place to lend 
        the appearance of a false unity. This unity is created by the painted 
        and collaged surface of the grid and is held together by the boundaries 
        of the stretched canvas.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        is also my sense of the relationship between the artist and the poet who 
        collaborate together. The poems and images form a larger symbiosis that 
        enhances the interpretation of the synthetic whole. Thus, the idea of 
        “poetry plastique” is an interpretative visualization of the underlying 
        abstract imagery and mood and emotions of the poems. Particularly, when 
        dealing with ironic, dense, and open-ended poems like Charles’s, I feel 
        free to provide my own interpretive response.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Different 
        poets suggest different approaches to collaboration. For example, in setting 
        the poems of Susan Howe in <i>Bed Hangings,</i> I felt more directed by 
        the poem’s historical subject matter: Puritans, religion, colonial America, 
        fabric design, and textiles. All of these were of major importance to 
        the interpretation and imagery of the pictures and so my images centered 
        upon them. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        collaborations between poets and visual artists, I feel that the artist 
        should match the wavelength of her or his artistic intuition and vision 
        to the intensity and demands of the poet’s words. It is a challenge and 
        pleasure to be able to form visual reponses to overpowering verbal stimulants. 
        Some of my inspirations have been the medieval illuminated pages, the 
        books of William Blake and William Morris, as well as the work of Max 
        Ernst, John Heartfield, and Hannah Höch. But, most of all, the amazing 
        ability of writers to conjure up whole worlds of images with their words 
        continues to fascinate and inspire me to follow suit with a visual response.
