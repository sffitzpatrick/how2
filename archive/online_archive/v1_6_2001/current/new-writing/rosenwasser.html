      <p align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(Notes 
        From a Panel Discussion at the San Francisco Center for the Book celebrating 
        the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Kelsey St. Press)</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the 1980s several things coalesced in the San Francisco Bay Area that 
        helped us redefine Kelsey St. Press. It signaled the end of our using 
        Patricia Dienstfrey’s basement as our letterpress print shop. This was 
        a time marked by literary foment where notions about voice, culture and 
        linguistic authority were being challenged. Kathleen Fraser and a number 
        of other Bay Area writers, among them Susan Gevirtz and Frances Jaffer 
        began the magazine <i>How(ever)</i>. <i>How(ever)</i> was in the forefront 
        of featuring this new writing. In fact in 1982 we were in constant conversation 
        with Kathleen because we were in the midst of producing her book <i>Something 
        (even human voices) in the foreground, a lake</i>.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many 
        of us were reading each other's writing and reading the theory of the 
        French feminists.  As a result our notions about poetry, language, space 
        and the body changed. We were intrigued by practices that challenged traditional 
        boundaries of identity and form. Collaboration by its very nature negotiated 
        this treacherous territory.  An inevitable leap takes place into the unknown.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Serendipity 
        in all its idiosyncratic manifestations seemed to be pushing the Press 
        to new engagements between text and image.  Contemporary art has always 
        been one of my passions.   In 1984 the painter Kate Delos invited me to 
        collaborate with her. When Kate and I began we weren’t thinking about 
        bookmaking. We were perusing texts and images of the ancient Romans.  
        As our collaboration took shape a book seemed the perfect form. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
        our book, <i>Simulacra,</i> with its monoprint portraits and narrative 
        voices was published we had no idea the book would act as a spring board—a 
        catalyst to a series of Kelsey St. collaborations.  Later that same year 
        Barbara Guest approached us with her own idea for a collaboration. Doing 
        collaborative books was new to Kelsey Street Press but not to Barbara. 
        She had been closely aligned with the painters and writers of the New 
        York School.  She collaborated with numerous members of that group to 
        produce poem-paintings as well as books.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Barbara 
        proposed that she do a book with the Bay Area landscape and figurative 
        painter, June Felter. <i>Musicality</i>, Barbara’s poem engaged the space 
        and rhythm of movements through June’s landscapes. My brother Robert Rosenwasser 
        (the designer), June Felter and I spent hours looking at watercolors and 
        drawings before we chose and laid out the drawings that would form the 
        book. We imagined the book as if turning the pages were akin to meandering 
        through the landscape.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
        the time <i>Musicality</i> was completed the Press realized it was on 
        to a new thing. Suddenly we had a collaboration series. From there it 
        was just a small leap to <i>Peculiar Motions</i>, (Rosmarie Waldrop and 
        Jennifer Macdonald); <i>Just Whistle</i>, (CD Wright and Deborah Luster); 
        <i>Arcade</i>, (Erica Hunt and Alison Saar): <i>Isle</i>, (Rena Rosenwasser 
        and Kate Delos) and <i>Stripped Tales</i>, Barbara Guest and Anne Dunn.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We’ve 
        produced three collaborative projects with the author Mei-mei Berssenbrugge. 
        <i>Four Year Old Girl</i> and <i>Sphericity</i> involved the artist Richard 
        Tuttle, and <i>Endocrinology</i> involved the artist Kiki Smith. <i>Endocrinology</i> 
        was actually one of the most complicated and difficult of productions. 
        Our offset book in a format of 9 x 9 was actually a facsimile of a 18&quot; 
        square book produced by Universal Limited Art Editions. The ULAE book 
        sells for thousands of dollars. Our book costs $17.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
        of the immense consideration and care and thoughtfulness of both Keith 
        Whittaker and Marian O’Brian at West Coast Print Center we have been able 
        to work out complicated design and production solutions. Without their 
        assistance we could not produce any of these collaborations. They work 
        hand in hand with me on each project.  Robert Rosenwasser has designed 
        all of our collaborations with the exception of <i>Arcade</i>, designed 
        by Lory Poulson.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        collaborative process involves more than just the artist and the writer. 
        By the time the Press gets to the stage where a book is on the press, 
        innumerable hours of meetings with the book designer, the artist, the 
        author and the printers—all essential parts of the collaboration—have 
        taken place.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our 
        most recent publication is Barbara Guest and Laurie Reid’s <i>Symbiosis</i>; 
        this is collaboration in its most ideal form.<br>
