        <p align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(Notes 
          From a Panel Discussion at the San Francisco Center for the Book celebrating 
          the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Kelsey St. Press)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the 1980s several things coalesced in the San Francisco Bay Area that 
          helped us redefine Kelsey St. Press. It signaled the end of our using 
          Patricia Dienstfrey’s basement as our letterpress print shop. This was 
          a time marked by literary foment where notions about voice, culture and 
          linguistic authority were being challenged. Kathleen Fraser and a number 
          of other Bay Area writers, among them Susan Gevirtz and Frances Jaffer 
          began the magazine <i>How(ever)</i>. <i>How(ever)</i> was in the forefront 
          of featuring this new writing. In fact in 1982 we were in constant conversation 
          with Kathleen because we were in the midst of producing her book <i>Something 
          (even human voices) in the foreground, a lake</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many 
          of us were reading each other's writing and reading the theory of the 
          French feminists.  As a result our notions about poetry, language, space 
          and the body changed. We were intrigued by practices that challenged traditional 
          boundaries of identity and form. Collaboration by its very nature negotiated 
          this treacherous territory.  An inevitable leap takes place into the unknown.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Serendipity 
          in all its idiosyncratic manifestations seemed to be pushing the Press 
          to new engagements between text and image.  Contemporary art has always 
          been one of my passions.   In 1984 the painter Kate Delos invited me to 
          collaborate with her. When Kate and I began we weren’t thinking about 
          bookmaking. We were perusing texts and images of the ancient Romans.  
          As our collaboration took shape a book seemed the perfect form. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
          our book, <i>Simulacra,</i> with its monoprint portraits and narrative 
          voices was published we had no idea the book would act as a spring board—a 
          catalyst to a series of Kelsey St. collaborations.  Later that same year 
          Barbara Guest approached us with her own idea for a collaboration. Doing 
          collaborative books was new to Kelsey Street Press but not to Barbara. 
          She had been closely aligned with the painters and writers of the New 
          York School.  She collaborated with numerous members of that group to 
          produce poem-paintings as well as books.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Barbara 
          proposed that she do a book with the Bay Area landscape and figurative 
          painter, June Felter. <i>Musicality</i>, Barbara’s poem engaged the space 
          and rhythm of movements through June’s landscapes. My brother Robert Rosenwasser 
          (the designer), June Felter and I spent hours looking at watercolors and 
          drawings before we chose and laid out the drawings that would form the 
          book. We imagined the book as if turning the pages were akin to meandering 
          through the landscape.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          the time <i>Musicality</i> was completed the Press realized it was on 
          to a new thing. Suddenly we had a collaboration series. From there it 
          was just a small leap to <i>Peculiar Motions</i>, (Rosmarie Waldrop and 
          Jennifer Macdonald); <i>Just Whistle</i>, (CD Wright and Deborah Luster); 
          <i>Arcade</i>, (Erica Hunt and Alison Saar): <i>Isle</i>, (Rena Rosenwasser 
          and Kate Delos) and <i>Stripped Tales</i>, Barbara Guest and Anne Dunn.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We’ve 
          produced three collaborative projects with the author Mei-mei Berssenbrugge. 
          <i>Four Year Old Girl</i> and <i>Sphericity</i> involved the artist Richard 
          Tuttle, and <i>Endocrinology</i> involved the artist Kiki Smith. <i>Endocrinology</i> 
          was actually one of the most complicated and difficult of productions. 
          Our offset book in a format of 9 x 9 was actually a facsimile of a 18&quot; 
          square book produced by Universal Limited Art Editions. The ULAE book 
          sells for thousands of dollars. Our book costs $17.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
          of the immense consideration and care and thoughtfulness of both Keith 
          Whittaker and Marian O’Brian at West Coast Print Center we have been able 
          to work out complicated design and production solutions. Without their 
          assistance we could not produce any of these collaborations. They work 
          hand in hand with me on each project.  Robert Rosenwasser has designed 
          all of our collaborations with the exception of <i>Arcade</i>, designed 
          by Lory Poulson.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          collaborative process involves more than just the artist and the writer. 
          By the time the Press gets to the stage where a book is on the press, 
          innumerable hours of meetings with the book designer, the artist, the 
          author and the printers—all essential parts of the collaboration—have 
          taken place.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our 
          most recent publication is Barbara Guest and Laurie Reid’s <i>Symbiosis</i>; 
          this is collaboration in its most ideal form.<br>
