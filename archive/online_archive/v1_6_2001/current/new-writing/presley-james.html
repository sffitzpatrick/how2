        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          is relatively little discussion of writer to writer collaboration in poetry 
          and poetics.  There’s no entry for it in the last edition of the Princeton 
          Encyclopaedia, although there is one for Japanese linked verse.  Yet we 
          all know of writer to writer collaborations, especially in more experimental 
          writing.  In Britain examples spring to mind by poets such as Lawrence 
          Upton and Bob Cobbing, Alan Halsey and Gavin Selerie, and Harry Gilonis 
          and Tony Baker.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
          of the main antecedents for this type of collaboration are the dadaist 
          and surrealist collective games, which were a way of defeating logic and 
          rising above personal subjectivity.   I would, however, be uncomfortable 
          if collaboration was considered entirely as a game, as that can seem like 
          another straitjacket.  There was some element of that in a discussion 
          on the British &amp; Irish poets list a few years ago, with Peter Riley 
          asserting that collaborative verse is inevitably humorous or light verse.(1)

          </span></span>One of the main influences on my decision to do a collaboration 
          was hearing Leslie Scalapino talk about a collaboration of single line 
          responses.  I became aware of a desire to avoid individual set pieces, 
          in which each poem is distinct from the other.  I liked the idea of a 
          rapid intersecting of voices, although, in the end, single lines seemed 
          like too constricting a form, and our entries varied in length, increasing 
          as the collaboration progressed and we became more confident in it, as 
          you do in a correspondence.   </font></p>

          other’s work and acted both as readers and writers, as well as rereaders 
          and rewriters.  We were free to respond or not to respond to each other’s 
          contributions.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          medium that we used was email.  My previous major collaboration, <i>Automatic 
          Cross Stitch</i>, was with the artist Irma Irsara, and one of the reasons 
          for its success was the fact that we live very close to each other.  This 
          geographical proximity was essential for my involvement in the abstract 
          art and mixed media of Irma’s work.  The exchange of texts is easier, 
          yet communication is a key factor in any collaboration, and phone and 
          post aren’t always adequate, especially for a simultaneous collaboration.  
          So, to return to Leslie Scalapino, I was interested when she explained 
          that hers was a fax collaboration. While I was thinking about a fax collaboration, 
          which did not work out in the end, and not just because of my limited 
          access to a fax machine, I began to use email.  An e-motion, as Ric Caddel 
          has said.  And from there to e mute, which brings me on to why I called 
          this introduction “collaboration in the feminine”. </font></p>

          </span></span>Collaboration in the feminine</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          took this title from a collection of texts from the Canadian journal of 
          women’s writing, <i>Tessera</i>.  In doing so I wanted to acknowledge 
          another recent influence and precursor to this work: feminist discourse 
          and ecriture feminine.  The term collaboration as used in <i>Tessera</i> 
          is applied mainly to the editorial collaboration on the journal rather 
          than to collaborative texts.  Nevertheless collaboration is seen as fundamental 
          to their project.  As Barbara Godard explains: collaboration is a process 
          which foregrounds the exchange of the signifier and the instability of 
          all language practice.  Or, to quote Lorraine Weir, “In setting aside 
          the illusions of closure, completion, stasis, perfection—the ideals of 
          a patriarchal society…we enter the possibility of the open text, the so-called 
          ‘fragment,’ the writing which exists not to valorize its author/ity (Foucault) 
          but to be activated in the process of reading/making/collaborating.”(2)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>e) 
          Recent collaborative texts by women poets</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another 
          surprise in looking at these issues was how few examples there seemed 
          to be of recent collaborative texts by women poets, and even rarer is 
          any analysis of them.  An exception is Ann Vickery’s paper: “Travelogues 
          of errant desire: tracing an erotic politic in feminist collaborations.”(3)  
          She focuses on two examples from North America: Marlatt and Warland’s 
          <i>Double Negative</i> (4), and Harryman and Hejinian’s <i>The Wide Road</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          only British example, though a very important one, that came to my mind, 
          was Mulford and Riley’s <i>No Fee</i>, although it isn’t that recent (5). 
          I haven’t analysed it closely, but it’s wonderfully inventive and experimental, 
          while remaining suitably downbeat and British. I’m not sure how <i>No 
          Fee</i> was written, but it’s worth noting that although the poems are 
          anonymous, they are also clearly differentiated on the page.  I think 
          that the first half of the book is mainly Riley and the second is Mulford.  
          In spite of further research I haven’t discovered any more recent examples 
          in the UK, or, at least, none that have been published.  I don’t want 
          to over emphasise the American influence however, and one of the main 
          source texts in our collaboration, and in Harryman and Hejinian’s, is 
          by Angela Carter (6). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>f) 
          Questioning of identity</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          questioning of identity in collaboration is something that Vickery examines.  
          Collaboration, to quote Vickery, is a practice defined around a crossing-over 
          of authority, which makes the questioning of identity explicit, particularly 
          in the kind of collaboration Elizabeth and I have chosen.  “As a liminal 
          space of encounter, collaboration suggests that the subject may always 
          be incorporated into some sort of identification with the other.  This 
          formation of intersubjectivity is perhaps best realised as a process of 
          desire, with the text as a site of ongoing affirmation as well as argument.”  
          Or to quote Carey Caplan and Ellen Rose: “ ‘She’ and ‘I’ metamorphose 
          into ‘we’, hypothetical, invisible, yet nonetheless articulate.  ‘We’ 
          emerges from the space between our individual, different voices, its meaning 
          elusive, dispersed, always deferred, never unitary.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span> </span>           
          This movement between the individual and some kind of identification was 
          certainly part of our experience in this type of collaboration.  As the 
          surrealists also knew, it is a way of going beyond the individual subject. 
          There were inevitably, given our cultural similarities, convergence of 
          language and subject matter, as well as strange coincidences.  There were 
          also differences and underlying arguments. Well, quite overt arguments 
          really.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          seems like a good place to stop to writing as this I.  If I/we went on 
          to write about some of the poetic devices and themes of this collaboration 
          it would be better done by both of us, as an antiphon.  </font></p>

          Since writing my talk, there has been a collaborative performance between 
          two experimental British women poets: Caroline Bergvall and Dell Olsen, 
          in partnership with the composer Ian White. It was a one evening only, 
          improvised event, and does not exist in published form. According to Bergvall, 
          it was conducted in a spirit of non-ownership, and was a response to time-limitations 
          which became the structuring device for the whole piece.</font></p>

  lang=EN-GB>Neither One Nor The Other</span></i> was conducted by e-mail, during 
          the financial year 1998-9.  The epigraph is taken from Irigaray’s essay 
          “The Culture of Difference” (1987) in <i>je, tu, nous: Toward a Culture 
          of Difference</i>, translated by Alison Martin (Routledge, 1993). Among 
          the poets’ interests and occasions were: the music of Hildegard of Bingen 
          (“those wide melodic leaps”)—her <i>Ordo Virtutum</i> was performed at 
          the Royal Albert Hall on the 8th of September; Merce Cunningham (“a dance 
          without falling””)—his company performed at the Barbican on the 8th of 
          October; William Blake (his “linear terms”), especially “The sea of time 
          and space” (The Arlington Court picture), 1821; Louise Bourgeois (“his 
          black weight on her calipered body…,” “everything was showing…”)—her exhibition 
          at the Serpentine Gallery in December; <i>Mrs Brown</i>, a film about 
          Queen Victoria’s relationship with a Scottish gillie.  Angela Carter’s 
          <i>The Sadeian Woman </i>was published by Virago in 1979; the 1998-9 pantomime 
          at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith was based on her version of the Cinderella 
          story.  <i>The Marginalization of Poetry: Language Writing and Literary 
          History</i> is by Bob Perelman (published by Princeton University Press, 
          1996). Other poets quoted or alluded to include Olive (“made a dash towards 
          the subvocal”) Custance (English 1890s), Frank O’Hara, and our esteemed 
          contemporary Ulli Freer.  “VI” a.k.a. Vertical Images, Vegetal Irradiance,

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yes, I’m 
          sure you’re right about meeting in 1980, although I may have disputed 
          this in the past.  I went to two or three of those writing courses from 
          ’78-80, and I sometimes blur them.  That was before they became very expensive 
          and highly regimented.  Who was running them was also less important in 
          those days—it was more of a space to write—, and it was rather accidental 
          that I ended up with the New Zealanders.  I often found that with tutor 
          couples I would like one and not the other.  If it were a male/ female 
          pairing it would be the woman who would make more effort socially, especially 
          if they were married.  The same was true of the sisters, however, who 
          exhibited something of the male/ female divide.  The elder of the two, 
          the poet, was rather aloof, and yet flirtatious with the young man you 
          describe.  I certainly felt excluded by her preoccupation with him.  The 
          younger one, the novelist, was warm and open and colluding.  She seemed 
          to be the happier of the two sisters, and now I remember that they had 
          grown up in a family of independent women with freedom to roam.  It’s 
          in the older sister’s poetry, riding down the coast.</font></p>
