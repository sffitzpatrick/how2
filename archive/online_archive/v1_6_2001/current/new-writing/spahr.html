style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
        I teach creative writing, I always begin with a few minutes of private 
        writing. I wrote most of this piece during those moments. This is an excerpt 
        from a much longer piece. I felt when I was writing it that I had Pamela 
        Lu’s work in my head somewhere. Or probably more than Pamela Lu.  Probably 
        what I might call the “California sentence.” Last year, Pamela, Renee 
        Gladman, and Summi Kaipa came to read and they all read sentences. And 
        then over the summer I heard Fanny Howe read at Boulder. She read poems 
        but her poems made me think of her sentences. And all of them made me 
        think about prose as something friendly and exciting, as a place where 
        one could think about relations. </font></span>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font size="4"><b>Unevenness</b></font></span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There was a day to day rhythm. One of them moved from 
        bed to bed. One was always coupled. One was single every other night. 
        There was a pattern. And so each day a thought had to be had about which 
        bed had been the bed for waking. Or which skin had been the most touched 
        of the skins. What certain specific memory had been the most recent. A 
        smell. Or a feeling. Or a satisfaction. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>As a result, this relationship, a new relationship for 
        all of them, had motion, had airplanes. When they began the relationship, 
        one of them had met the other two in a city that was half way between 
        the coast they moved from and the island they were moving to. Then they 
        all got on an airplane to the island. Two sat in one row of two seats. 
        One sat in a row ahead. The one who sat in a row ahead talked with another 
        person in the same row who had lived on an atoll for a number of years. 
        But now the atoll was gone because the water had risen above it. </span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>When they first landed they went from the airplane into 
        a car. They went from a car into an empty apartment and then went from 
        an empty apartment into a bar where they had beers in the afternoon. They 
        were awkward because they got off the airplane on an island. They were 
        awkward with their bodies in the five-hour time difference after a ten-hour 
        flight. They were awkward because they had never lived together before.</span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For a long time everything felt like airplanes to them. 
        Like moving between. Like migration. Like motion. Like dry mouth and tiredness 
        and boredom. Like stale air and the hope of getting somewhere. Like awkward 
        sitting in seats. And sudden drops in altitude and turbulence that if 
        they just held on and relaxed it would be ok. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Shortly after they found themselves on an island it was 
        announced that a giant melting puddle of ice had formed on one of the 
        poles of the earth. Things were melting and this mattered because the 
        ocean surrounded them. The ocean was huge and it was filled with `o`opu 
        and `ala`ihi and `u`u and limu and plastic. It was so huge and so all 
        around them that it was strange to think about. And then even stranger 
        to think some more about it rising. The vastness of the ocean made the 
        television news strange because behind the news anchors was a representation 
        of the island amid this huge expanse of ocean, a growing expanse, and 
        although the news was about what was happening in the rest of the world 
        there was no evidences of the rest of the world on the back drop.</span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They arrived then on an island and they had histories. 
        But their histories were small, were nothing compared to the history of 
        the island. They were newcomers to the island. It was contested land. 
        It had big metaphors of place. It was not that they couldn’t find things 
        similar to them. All around them were reminders of what they were and 
        of their impact. They lived among plants that grew into each other in 
        various and unique ways. There was the huehue haole, or the passion flower 
        vine, which smothered shrubs, small trees and the ground layer. Seeds 
        from its fruit were dispersed by alien frugivorous birds.  The koa haole 
        which formed dense thickets and excluded all other plants. Most of the 
        birds they saw around them came from other places and took over. The myna 
        was introduced in 1865 to control army worms. The hedge sparrow was introduced 
        in 1871. The Japanese white eye was introduced in 1929. The red-billed 
        Leiothrix probably escaped from a cage in 1911. As the birds changed, 
        the plants changed with them from native to largely alien because the 
        birds carried seeds in their feathers and in their waste. There was an 
        indigenous bird, the kolea, that summered on the continent and wintered 
        on the island. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Gradually, the airplane feeling faded away. They got 
        used to the time. Their skin recovered some resiliency. Their nostrils 
        no longer hurt. Their eyes didn’t feel dry. But the history of the island 
        remained in their consciousness and slowly began to define them. The history, 
        one of overthrow and occupation and then of denial of rights to certain 
        humans and of racism and of repression of culture and language, remained 
        with them and was inescapable in most daily interactions. They were a 
        part of this history of occupation. They had no choice in how they were 
        seen as occupiers. It was with them in line at the grocery store and while 
        waiting for the light to change at the intersection. It was with them 
        when they walked down the streets and when they met people in a bar. This 
        history swooped down and then took away what they thought they were and 
        replaced it with a weak complicity with power that they didn’t like about 
        themselves but had to accept even as they tried to speak out against it 
        in their tiny ineffectual voices.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They began in this place with new patterns of relating. 
        There were new patterns of their relationship and the new patterns the 
        history of the place left on their relationships with others. They felt 
        stroked by the weather that was unusually pleasant. But they felt lost 
        otherwise. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Their bodies confused them mainly. They could not understand 
        how they fit into each other or around others. The intricacies of relation. 
        How their bodies might exist. How they were changing into other bodies, 
        slowly growing into other invasive presences. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this new place, they each had their own room. They 
        lived their lives most fully in their own rooms, at their own desks. Most 
        of their emotional life was experienced at their desks and they often 
        interacted with each other from these desks through their computers. Yet 
        the desks that they had in each room were identical. They had made them 
        together on the same day out of plywood. And the desk chairs were identical. 
        They had gone together to the office warehouse store and they had bought 
        three identical desk chairs with wheels and blue denim upholstery. They 
        each had computers on their desks. But they kept their identical desk 
        chairs at different heights. And they kept different sorts of things on 
        their desks and their computers. One had papers and books strewn about 
        in piles, abandoned birds’ nests, and several lamps. One had ashtrays 
        and matches and voodoo dolls and candles. One had shells and weird materials 
        found on the ground and math books. They tried to think of their lives 
        and their desks in political terms as mixes of individualism and collectivism, 
        boundaries and ties, locals and globals. They wondered if they were a 
        new pattern or a very old pattern that had fallen out of style and then 
        been forgotten about. None of this thinking went much of anywhere. They 
        wondered about this in the back of their heads, in the background of their 
        daily thoughts. The front of their heads couldn’t really see the pattern 
        or make sense of it. They were as aquarium fish who did not understand 
        they were in a tank and there was no where to go. The day to day felt 
        normal to them. They got up and made breakfast and then they went and 
        did the things they did for work and then they would meet later in the 
        day and eat dinner and then do the things that people did before they 
        went to bed like read or watch something on television. This they thought 
        of as normal life. They just did it with the motion of moving between 
        three instead of one and another. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They talked some about the pool of melting but cool water 
        on the pole. And then some more of the atoll that was no longer an atoll. 
        This caused thoughts also of what it meant to be part of the country that 
        uses the most energy. The country most responsible for the growth in the 
        ozone hole that was growing over islands that were far away from this 
        country. And the country also responsible for the bombing of various nearby 
        islands. They thought about citizenship in a land where the nation occupied. 
        Then this lead to thoughts about the extinction of species, which had 
        a special relevance as more species were dying on the island they had 
        moved to than anywhere else. This was all juxtaposed to daily life on 
        the island itself where the air felt moist and lush and kind. And it was 
        so wonderful, yet so not theirs, that they did not know really what it 
        meant that it was going away. Or what it meant that some of it had been 
        lost because it was so much more wonderful in terms of nature than other 
        places even as it was an island of loss that they had no idea how to imagine 
        it as more than what it was right at the moment. They were limited by 
        their ability to envision it because nature in their lives had always 
        been shaped by the development and industry that was creating the hole 
        in the ozone, the melting pool of ice, the disappearing atolls. </span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They got off the airplane and adjusted but the airplane 
        remained with them, remained a reminder of things as it spewed out carbon 
        dioxide and carried tourists back and forth. They had a lanai that overlooked 
        the flight pattern and they could watch every few minutes a plane flying 
        away to a place they felt was a home of sorts, or more of a home than 
        where they were. This felt comforting because they felt they were a part 
        of the planes and the planes a part of them. And this part of them that 
        was part of it, felt comforted by the airplanes arc that happened every 
        few minutes at regular intervals all day long. They felt comforted even 
        as one summer JFK Jr. and Caroline and the sister whose name is never 
        remembered did not arrive and were lost in the ocean. When things were 
        not going well they worried that they were caught in the downward spiral 
        plunge of overcompensating by holding the steering wheel so far away from 
        couplehood that they were going into cold water even in hot summer and 
        landing on the bottom of together.</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>As it is for all humans, many other humans interacted 
        with them and they were grateful when their identical desks and chairs 
        were seen as normal, as something that could be mentioned casually in 
        conversation but did not need to be dwelled upon or would not make anyone 
        confused or nervous. They were grateful even when a friend gave them the 
        video <i>Jules et Jim, </i>even though two of them refused to watch it. 
        They said it was because it was in French but the one of them who watched 
        wished that they had not because it ends badly. Another time they were 
        grateful when a friend called late at night after he had been drinking 
        awa. He asked what it was like. He said he couldn’t even keep one relationship 
        going because he had no time. And one of them said it makes time. It makes 
        everyone independent. Relationships become wide like decks on barges. 
        Or something like that. Even though they were not speaking well or lacked 
        words they were grateful because they had a hard time telling others about 
        who was what. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They had no metaphor. They had met one afternoon at a 
        bar and talked it over. At the bar meeting, it was hard for them to talk. 
        They felt uncomfortable. But they decided to move to an island together. 
        Once they were on the island they had no words for themselves. They had 
        only theories. And the words they thought they might use did not work. 
        They did not know what to make of how it felt reassuring to watch on public 
        television the female hedge sparrow vigorously shaking her tail feathers 
        at two different male birds to indicate her desire to be inseminated by 
        each of them in close succession, to watch a cable channel’s documentary 
        on the marrying tribe of the Amazon, to watch the music channel’s soap 
        opera subplot of a girl and her agreement with two guys which involved 
        neither of them having sex with her independently but was of course immediately 
        broken by two of them when the third went off to study. The interest they 
        felt in these images that came at them without their input made them feel 
        stupid but they could find few models to turn to among their friends so 
        they could not stop thinking about these models made for them by other 
        people far away from them, by people who did not even understand them. 
        Lack of understanding was all around. It defined them. They could not 
        understand the marrying tribe. They did not even know the real name of 
        the marrying tribe, the name that the members of the tribe had chosen 
        to call themselves. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>They did not want models to matter but a scarcity of 
        models made the ones they came across big in their minds. When talking 
        to others, such as their parents, they kept resorting to metaphors of 
        nature, as if that would make them natural. But the metaphors of nature 
        always failed them. Everything happens somewhere in nature. For every 
        polygamous hedge sparrow or Amazonian fairy wren there were all those 
        birds that mated for life. And the documentary on the life of birds cautioned 
        that the extreme infidelity of hedge sparrows was not widespread among 
        birds least they identify too completely. </span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>What the friend should have been told is that they were 
        an organic blob. They took over each other. They absorbed and digested 
        each other. There were parts of they that were indigestible to the blob, 
        belt buckles, bones and teeth, finger and toe nails. Because they were 
        always worried that they would be seen as a blob, they tried to fool their 
        friends by showing them this detritus. Or another way, they were stoned 
        say on a drug that made them digest and the rest of the world was not 
        only not stoned but disapproving of stoned people who digested. </span> 
        </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The three of them moved to an island and this sounds 
        like a little grass shack story with a ukulele and a palm tree but they 
        were lovers of desks and they were trying to be like the finches who grew 
        new and different beaks in reaction to the wide variety of microclimates 
        on their island. They arrived by plane. And they identified with planes. 
        And they didn’t like this part of themselves but it was a part of themselves 
        anyway. They avoided words to describe their relation because words felt 
        wrong. And there were not any really. They heard rumors of there being 
        words for their sort of relation in the language that was originally spoken 
        on the island, but they could not speak this language. They asked a few 
        people who studied it about the words and these people did not know them. 
        In their language all the words made them feel funny or dirty or untrue. 
        Instead they just configured themselves in sets and forgot about words 
        even as they often found it necessary to use metaphors. They tried to 
        understand the balance of stools. The rules of triangles. The smoothness 
        of three point turns made by a new but practiced driver in a driver’s 
        education class. And things went on being normal really. Or feeling that 
        way even though they didn’t really like that word, even as they took comfort 
        in its feeling. </span> </font>
