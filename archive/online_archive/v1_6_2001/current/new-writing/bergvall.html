  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental 
          or exploratory writing is a mode of thinking and of thinking roles and 
          rules of language which inevitably has come to demand largely specialist 
          reading habits. Yet not as systematically specialist as they have become 
          or been made out to be. Such writing covers great disparities in practice 
          and motivation. This small selection presents recent pieces by a few poets 
          and text-based artists, most of whom live in England. Some are British, 
          some are not. Some are already known to HOW2 readers, some not. Some usually 
          present their work within literary and poetic networks, some are better 
          known in British visual arts and performance circuits. HOW2 being a web 
          environment, a number of the pieces were rethought and redesigned specifically 
          for this reading environment. Where more appropriate to the work, the 
          pieces were “simply” transferred from the page. </font></span></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
          emphasis on text practices that cut across a range of artistic and literary 
          fields seems to me an essential ingredient in ensuring the continued pertinence 
          of poetic work as a mode of investigation which has a part to play in 
          public discourses on art, rather than as one kept for the research lab. 
          In this sense, the experimental female poets and text-based artists represented 
          in this selection seem to me to each in their way indicate a willingness 
          to localise the rules of practice and to recognise the explicit and the 
          implicit impact of social constructions on textual process. </span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
          British experimental poetry scene is a stretched and resolutely unnamed 
          map of divergent factions, mostly held together by the poets themselves 
          and a few critics, many of whom act as their own support system, being 
          also its publishers, editors, researchers, lecturers, conference organisers. 
          By necessity and the lamentable conditions of funding for such work in 
          Britain, most of this activity exists in low-key productions and hand 
          to hand distributions which rarely make it into bookshops or national 
          platforms. Furthermore, as investigative forms do not fit under any of 
          the agendas set by mainstream publishers and the media,  British experimental 
          poetry is often either ridiculed or targeted as unreadable (see for instance 
          the extreme virulence of the reviews to Iain Sinclair’s 1996 anthology 
          of contemporary experimental work, <i>Conductors of Chaos</i>, perceived 
          as an aberration even by its mainstream publishers Picador). </span></font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Something else is wanting in this antagonised universe 
          which also emphasises its isolation in relation to other writing scenes 
          and artforms in Britain. Indeed, beyond long-standing interests in dialectical 
          languages and local class-based histories, issues of psycho-social identity 
          as related to body configurations, such as gendering or genderedness and 
          the reevaluation of the workings of belonging (and of belongings) which 
          arises from these (for instance), are only rarely explicitly acknowledged 
          as viable methodological concerns in approaching the writing projects 
          produced with the British experiemental poetry scene. Disparately published 
          critical pieces provide valuable exceptions to this. Overall, to carry 
          such identity under wraps, to conceptualise it in such a way that it doesn't 
          show or doesn't dent form, has become an adjunct of the innovative text. 
          More often than not it is considered an implicit responsibility of the 
          individual poet to discuss it or bring it forward in their work and in 
          their (conference/essay) contributions, should they so wish. As a consequence, 
          the way some of these &#147;issues&#148; are brought forward is often 
          as a game of hide-and-seek between having and being an identity, between 
          strict formalist conceptual range and representational shadow games. The 
          current, near total absence of critical journals or informal letters within 
          this scene certainly has a part to play in this internalised silence and 
          laisser-faire.</span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this respect, Maggie O’Sullivan’s anthology of experimental 
          English-speaking female poets <i>Out of Everywhere</i> (Reality Street 
          Editions, 1996) was a fundamental gesture. It somewhat highlighted the 
          complexities of the relationship textual modes necessarily entertain with 
          issues of identity and representational modes (here through the axis of 
          gender). It also made it quite clear that if, as a rule, the conversation 
          could not be had with any continuity in Britain (neither within experimental 
          nor mainstream circuits), it could be and was being had elsewhere. Since 
          then, and I would suggest to a large extent through the ripple effect 
          of her book, as well as through the increased traffic with (often more 
          vocal and better funded) North American poets, discussions, seminars, 
          conferences, etc., have been and are taking place to discuss the much 
          vexed question of experimental writing’s relation to representational 
          modes, and the role played by identity structures on the very nature of 
          formal explorations. Similarly, there is a detectable restlessness for 
          pushing on away from some of the less conducive constraints of experimental 
          traditions, as well as for discussing textual work alongside other arts 
          practices. </span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, if in such an avant-gardist and/or neo-modernist 
          and still largely phallocentric context there is still a suspicion of 
          selling-out when considering issues of representation an explicit part 
          of experimental poetics, things are not much better in the more mainstream 
          or officially supported poetry circuits where such concerns are gathered 
          up thematically, not methodologically, under the banner of Identity Politics. 
          &#147;Celebrating&#148; social/cultural marginality is one of its central 
          motifs and has been consistently promoted as such by publishing houses 
          and the press. This 
          unproblematised inevitability of identity provides for much text fodder 
          and makes Equal Opps a recognised publishing criterion which shifts more 
          books than mindsets. Such a formally conventional range and dangerously 
          sentimental take on poetry's role is of course terminally retrograde and 
          keeps mainstream poetry well outside the conceptual grounds explored so 
          successfully and buoyantly by the similarly much back and diverse British 
          visual arts and British performance art scenes of the last 15 years.</font></span>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive 
          and enduring effect of these bifurcated and resistant environments also 
          prevents potentially fruitful dialogues between poets from a range of 
          practices, whose formal explorations and ideological focus are at times 
          less profoundly divergent than is immediately apparent. Andy Brown's <i>Binary 
          Myths</i> (Stride, 1997 and 1999), a two volume series of conversations 
          with poets and poet-publishers from British &#147;experimental&#148; and 
          &#147;mainstream&#148; environments (the books also attempt to define 
          these terms), showed up for all its faults, not only the expected irreconcilable 
          differences but also and more surprisingly, the points of untapped common 
          interest which run at a tangent to the profound rift between them. This 
          is especially true of a shared and prevalent involvement in collaborative 
          work, an increased interest in and commitment to forms of text performance, 
          a growing awareness of the potential role of new media for writing. All 
          of these factors generate ways of thinking about writing and of attending 
          to reading which could potentially beleaguer the polarisation and damaging 
          short-circuiting of poetic environments in Britain. This seems to me an 
          additional reason why textual practice which recognises, either cross-genre 
          input or cross-disciplinary discursivity as part of its strategies, are 
          likely to be able to provide for an important critical and artistic leap 
          away from the current stalemate and to open up dialogues around the nature 
          and definition of innovation for poetry and of its public role.</span></font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Is there at present a greater willingness to question 
          the nature of our roles as experimental poets in Britain? Perhaps there 
          is. Certainly it would enable us to cut across the respective limitations 
          of the specific and divided poetry scenes to slowly allow for a configuration 
          of debates through which textual practice might be seen to excite, rather 
          than confirm or evade, the acid fray of socio-cultural representations, 
          which art contributes to.</span></font></p>
