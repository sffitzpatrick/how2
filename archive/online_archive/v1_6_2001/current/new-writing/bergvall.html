style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental 
        or exploratory writing is a mode of thinking and of thinking roles and 
        rules of language which inevitably has come to demand largely specialist 
        reading habits. Yet not as systematically specialist as they have become 
        or been made out to be. Such writing covers great disparities in practice 
        and motivation. This small selection presents recent pieces by a few poets 
        and text-based artists, most of whom live in England. Some are British, 
        some are not. Some are already known to HOW2 readers, some not. Some usually 
        present their work within literary and poetic networks, some are better 
        known in British visual arts and performance circuits. HOW2 being a web 
        environment, a number of the pieces were rethought and redesigned specifically 
        for this reading environment. Where more appropriate to the work, the 
        pieces were “simply” transferred from the page. </font></span></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
        emphasis on text practices that cut across a range of artistic and literary 
        fields seems to me an essential ingredient in ensuring the continued pertinence 
        of poetic work as a mode of investigation which has a part to play in 
        public discourses on art, rather than as one kept for the research lab. 
        In this sense, the experimental female poets and text-based artists represented 
        in this selection seem to me to each in their way indicate a willingness 
        to localise the rules of practice and to recognise the explicit and the 
        implicit impact of social constructions on textual process. </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        British experimental poetry scene is a stretched and resolutely unnamed 
        map of divergent factions, mostly held together by the poets themselves 
        and a few critics, many of whom act as their own support system, being 
        also its publishers, editors, researchers, lecturers, conference organisers. 
        By necessity and the lamentable conditions of funding for such work in 
        Britain, most of this activity exists in low-key productions and hand 
        to hand distributions which rarely make it into bookshops or national 
        platforms. Furthermore, as investigative forms do not fit under any of 
        the agendas set by mainstream publishers and the media,  British experimental 
        poetry is often either ridiculed or targeted as unreadable (see for instance 
        the extreme virulence of the reviews to Iain Sinclair’s 1996 anthology 
        of contemporary experimental work, <i>Conductors of Chaos</i>, perceived 
        as an aberration even by its mainstream publishers Picador). </span></font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Something else is wanting in this antagonised universe 
        which also emphasises its isolation in relation to other writing scenes 
        and artforms in Britain. Indeed, beyond long-standing interests in dialectical 
        languages and local class-based histories, issues of psycho-social identity 
        as related to body configurations, such as gendering or genderedness and 
        the reevaluation of the workings of belonging (and of belongings) which 
        arises from these (for instance), are only rarely explicitly acknowledged 
        as viable methodological concerns in approaching the writing projects 
        produced with the British experiemental poetry scene. Disparately published 
        critical pieces provide valuable exceptions to this. Overall, to carry 
        such identity under wraps, to conceptualise it in such a way that it doesn't 
        show or doesn't dent form, has become an adjunct of the innovative text. 
        More often than not it is considered an implicit responsibility of the 
        individual poet to discuss it or bring it forward in their work and in 
        their (conference/essay) contributions, should they so wish. As a consequence, 
        the way some of these &#147;issues&#148; are brought forward is often 
        as a game of hide-and-seek between having and being an identity, between 
        strict formalist conceptual range and representational shadow games. The 
        current, near total absence of critical journals or informal letters within 
        this scene certainly has a part to play in this internalised silence and 
        laisser-faire.</span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In this respect, Maggie O’Sullivan’s anthology of experimental 
        English-speaking female poets <i>Out of Everywhere</i> (Reality Street 
        Editions, 1996) was a fundamental gesture. It somewhat highlighted the 
        complexities of the relationship textual modes necessarily entertain with 
        issues of identity and representational modes (here through the axis of 
        gender). It also made it quite clear that if, as a rule, the conversation 
        could not be had with any continuity in Britain (neither within experimental 
        nor mainstream circuits), it could be and was being had elsewhere. Since 
        then, and I would suggest to a large extent through the ripple effect 
        of her book, as well as through the increased traffic with (often more 
        vocal and better funded) North American poets, discussions, seminars, 
        conferences, etc., have been and are taking place to discuss the much 
        vexed question of experimental writing’s relation to representational 
        modes, and the role played by identity structures on the very nature of 
        formal explorations. Similarly, there is a detectable restlessness for 
        pushing on away from some of the less conducive constraints of experimental 
        traditions, as well as for discussing textual work alongside other arts 
        practices. </span> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, if in such an avant-gardist and/or neo-modernist 
        and still largely phallocentric context there is still a suspicion of 
        selling-out when considering issues of representation an explicit part 
        of experimental poetics, things are not much better in the more mainstream 
        or officially supported poetry circuits where such concerns are gathered 
        up thematically, not methodologically, under the banner of Identity Politics. 
        &#147;Celebrating&#148; social/cultural marginality is one of its central 
        motifs and has been consistently promoted as such by publishing houses 
        and the press. This 
        unproblematised inevitability of identity provides for much text fodder 
        and makes Equal Opps a recognised publishing criterion which shifts more 
        books than mindsets. Such a formally conventional range and dangerously 
        sentimental take on poetry's role is of course terminally retrograde and 
        keeps mainstream poetry well outside the conceptual grounds explored so 
        successfully and buoyantly by the similarly much back and diverse British 
        visual arts and British performance art scenes of the last 15 years.</font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive 
        and enduring effect of these bifurcated and resistant environments also 
        prevents potentially fruitful dialogues between poets from a range of 
        practices, whose formal explorations and ideological focus are at times 
        less profoundly divergent than is immediately apparent. Andy Brown's <i>Binary 
        Myths</i> (Stride, 1997 and 1999), a two volume series of conversations 
        with poets and poet-publishers from British &#147;experimental&#148; and 
        &#147;mainstream&#148; environments (the books also attempt to define 
        these terms), showed up for all its faults, not only the expected irreconcilable 
        differences but also and more surprisingly, the points of untapped common 
        interest which run at a tangent to the profound rift between them. This 
        is especially true of a shared and prevalent involvement in collaborative 
        work, an increased interest in and commitment to forms of text performance, 
        a growing awareness of the potential role of new media for writing. All 
        of these factors generate ways of thinking about writing and of attending 
        to reading which could potentially beleaguer the polarisation and damaging 
        short-circuiting of poetic environments in Britain. This seems to me an 
        additional reason why textual practice which recognises, either cross-genre 
        input or cross-disciplinary discursivity as part of its strategies, are 
        likely to be able to provide for an important critical and artistic leap 
        away from the current stalemate and to open up dialogues around the nature 
        and definition of innovation for poetry and of its public role.</span></font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Is there at present a greater willingness to question 
        the nature of our roles as experimental poets in Britain? Perhaps there 
        is. Certainly it would enable us to cut across the respective limitations 
        of the specific and divided poetry scenes to slowly allow for a configuration 
        of debates through which textual practice might be seen to excite, rather 
        than confirm or evade, the acid fray of socio-cultural representations, 
        which art contributes to.</span></font></p>
