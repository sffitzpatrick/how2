        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          October of 1999, we spent a week together on Lake Wentworth, New Hampshire. 
          Our intention was to begin work on a collaboration that would require 
          us to work in each other’s medium as well are our own. We wanted to attempt 
          a work that was site-specific and also time-specific. Our previous collaboration, 
          <i>The Traveler and the Hill and the Hill</i> (Granary Books, 1998) had 
          evolved over the course of several years, and for most of that time we 
          had worked on our respective parts separately, and this time we wanted 
          to explore the possibilities and problems of a collaboration in real time. 
          Indeed, “exploration” was to be one of the themes of the work, and in 
          retrospect the work can be seen as a study of an ecosystem, in which the 
          lake figures both as a literal and a metaphorical landscape. Language 
          and visual imagery were the ecological elements in the system of the work, 
          as the various material forms above, around, and below the lake’s surface 
          were in that of the site. We were interested in the interrelationships, 
          simultaneities, and the extents of layers; we were thinking about complex 
          emotional and aesthetic terrains along with the literal one we were investigating. 
          We imagined the lake as a site and described such a site being constituted 
          by all possible responses to it. We worked from early morning to late 
          at night, taking breaks to walk along the lakeshore or go out into the 
          lake in a kayak, photographing along the way (the rolls of film were developed 
          at a one-hour photo processing shop in the nearest town). At the end of 
          the week we found we had a sequence of pages that we felt together comprised 
          a work. Naturally, we called it “The Lake.”</font></p>
