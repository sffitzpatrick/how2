        Note: Extracts from <i>A Poetics of the Fragment</i></b></font> 
      <p> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Below are some extracts from my thesis on the poetics of 
        the fragment. <i>liv </i>is a novel written in fragments and the thesis 
        dialogues with the novel in quite an intimate way. I began working with 
        the fragment toward the end of writing my first collection of poetry. 
        It is a form akin to poetry, carrying similar intensities, and yet it 
        has a particular relationship to narrative, a kind of unpeeling happens 
        over the language because of the limitations of the fragment. It has a 
        particular charge.</font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The fragment is the site of surrender, of risking not only garment but 
        skin and organs, stripping down to an unstable, partial, multiple psychic 
        trembling. One cannot pass through intact. Yet as link it leads into the 
        timeless space of all possibility. Olivia’s loss is connected with the 
        death of her grandfather’s baby brother and the quiet practice of removing 
        his mother’s bloody insides with each unwanted pregnancy and Lydia’s terrible 
        anguish in the darkness of a childhood extinguished by the death of her 
        mother. Because she can cross into these fragments, she is also other 
        to them. Her life is composed of the psychic substance of many lives, 
        is shaped by traumas and choices made generations before she was born, 
        and it is also other to them. Her life is hers to create, to write, to 
        be in simultaneously. She writes her otherness, it allows itself through 
        the shared compassion of the fragmented space. In the fragment nobody 
        escapes the loss. The fragment is a narrative of loss, it performs the 
        rent. It is also the source of absolute compassion. It is the moment when 
        having lost all, each takes a spoon and dips it into the pot of beans, 
        boiled in salt water, in silence. It has no past and no future.</font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Olivia’s experiences of abuse remove the platform of the assured ‘I’. 
        She cannot access it even as a fallible construct. She finds herself choosing 
        to face the full extent of existential loss, the fragmentation of the 
        contemporary subject, because there is the chance that meaning, however 
        precarious, might return to her. She says <i>i know i can only haunt this 
        space, i am displaced many times over, but the attempt will transform 
        the field for myself and the other and the others of myself and even that 
        is enough. </i>The faith in this gesture is life affirming and akin to 
        the point of taking a breath. We do it, for the moment, whatever this 
        moment makes of us and whether this moment takes place consciously or 
        unconsciously.</font></span>
<p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        This is a vigilant space, where the silences, the spaces where word is 
        absent, hold their charge and direct it to the heart of the accountable 
        moment. We look for meaning in the space between the signifier and the 
        signified. It is the one place where it might happen and the waiting for 
        meaning’s signal, or its other, demands courage. But we wait as we would 
        for a possible meeting with a lover. There will be the fall, sooner or 
        later, but for now even the stars might be signalling me.</font></span>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        My second collection of poetry is based on the theme of fire. These poems 
        seek the burning in language, they test the flammability of how desire 
        operates across the word. Language is like fire. It is not a solid matter. 
        It consumes and transforms. It is creative and destructive. Some of the 
        poems below are from that collection. ‘Owl’ and ‘Body Language’ are from 
        my first collection. Again, these are language centered, working with 
        sensations of language experience.</font></span>

          he said that I knew he was mad. His madness was the only boundary we 
          had. It was madness that made sense, but had no place in a world of 
          physical laws and concerns. My friends hated him. They thought he was 
          just trying to be an arsehole. Or they thought he was retarded. He was 
          always dirty because he hated to wash and sometimes he stank. So then 
          we’d go down to one of the northern beaches at night and fuck in the 
          ocean. There is a family of stingrays that live in that bay. They would 
          gather, gliding into the bay in small sets to rest in the calm for the 
          night. They sometimes brushed our heels as we left the water. Then when 
          we got home and I was almost asleep, skin to skin with him, only several 
          thousand grains of limey sand between us, he’d slide down and lick me 
          with his steady salty tongue until I felt its every movement like the 
          flood of a small wave over my body; so that when I came I fell through 
          the weave of the sheets and lifted up through air particles and became 
          everything, especially my cunt. Later when I gave birth to Josephine, 
          my arms and legs shuddering and myself swimming from contraction to 
          contraction breath by breath, I would become my womb. Just a giant contracting 
          womb with head, arms and legs. With him, I was all cunt in the same 
          way. In that period there were times when it felt like it was something 
          of me, yet not of me. Like those strange sea hares you find washed up, 
          looking like huge turgid vulvas; labia, clitoris, vagina, only with 
          snail-like antennae. Beautiful purple-brown patterns. Mine was a creature 
          of its own, and never before and never since has this happened, but 
          it was as though he knew her better than I. So she was always surprising 
          and contradicting me, what I thought was me, till she taught me I was 
          her.</font></span> </p>

          trying to make something of the twee and banal. <i>Everything Men Know 
          About Women</i>. A mulch of chemicals, some toxic, some benign, and 
          the dust from milled trees. Their desiccated xylem, a little bleach 
          and they can become anything. And there is that temptation to write. 
          Several times I have picked up my pen to write one of my fragments. 
          The sensation of the fragment, its life, evaporates before the pen even 
          touches paper. Like those tiny insects that don’t even have a name. 
          They appear on your skin, or on a letter you’re reading. They are white 
          and they have wings and if you look carefully they look like miniature 
          cicadas. They sit on a single hair on the back of your hand and preen 
          themselves as comfortably as a monkey in a tree. No matter how careful 
          you are you can’t pick one up without killing it. You can’t even brush 
          it off. You are left with a pale greenish smear about the size of a 
          pinhead on your paper, or silvery dust on the ridges of skin at your 
          fingertips. The life and form and animation are gone. Just like that.</span></font></p>
