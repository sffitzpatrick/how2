              <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
        style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Below are some extracts from my thesis on the poetics of 
                the fragment. <i>liv </i>is a novel written in fragments and the thesis 
                dialogues with the novel in quite an intimate way. I began working with 
                the fragment toward the end of writing my first collection of poetry. 
                It is a form akin to poetry, carrying similar intensities, and yet it 
                has a particular relationship to narrative, a kind of unpeeling happens 
                over the language because of the limitations of the fragment. It has a 
                particular charge.</font></span>
              <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
        style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
                The fragment is the site of surrender, of risking not only garment but 
                skin and organs, stripping down to an unstable, partial, multiple psychic 
                trembling. One cannot pass through intact. Yet as link it leads into the 
                timeless space of all possibility. Olivia’s loss is connected with the 
                death of her grandfather’s baby brother and the quiet practice of removing 
                his mother’s bloody insides with each unwanted pregnancy and Lydia’s terrible 
                anguish in the darkness of a childhood extinguished by the death of her 
                mother. Because she can cross into these fragments, she is also other 
                to them. Her life is composed of the psychic substance of many lives, 
                is shaped by traumas and choices made generations before she was born, 
                and it is also other to them. Her life is hers to create, to write, to 
                be in simultaneously. She writes her otherness, it allows itself through 
                the shared compassion of the fragmented space. In the fragment nobody 
                escapes the loss. The fragment is a narrative of loss, it performs the 
                rent. It is also the source of absolute compassion. It is the moment when 
                having lost all, each takes a spoon and dips it into the pot of beans, 
                boiled in salt water, in silence. It has no past and no future.</font></span>

                Olivia’s experiences of abuse remove the platform of the assured ‘I’. 
                She cannot access it even as a fallible construct. She finds herself choosing 
                to face the full extent of existential loss, the fragmentation of the 
                contemporary subject, because there is the chance that meaning, however 
                precarious, might return to her. She says <i>i know i can only haunt this 
                space, i am displaced many times over, but the attempt will transform 
                the field for myself and the other and the others of myself and even that 
                is enough. </i>The faith in this gesture is life affirming and akin to 
                the point of taking a breath. We do it, for the moment, whatever this 
                moment makes of us and whether this moment takes place consciously or 
                unconsciously.</font></span>

                This is a vigilant space, where the silences, the spaces where word is 
                absent, hold their charge and direct it to the heart of the accountable 
                moment. We look for meaning in the space between the signifier and the 
                signified. It is the one place where it might happen and the waiting for 
                meaning’s signal, or its other, demands courage. But we wait as we would 
                for a possible meeting with a lover. There will be the fall, sooner or 
                later, but for now even the stars might be signalling me.</font></span>

                My second collection of poetry is based on the theme of fire. These poems 
                seek the burning in language, they test the flammability of how desire 
                operates across the word. Language is like fire. It is not a solid matter. 
                It consumes and transforms. It is creative and destructive. Some of the 
                poems below are from that collection. ‘Owl’ and ‘Body Language’ are from 
                my first collection. Again, these are language centered, working with 
                sensations of language experience.</font></span>

                  he said that I knew he was mad. His madness was the only boundary we 
                  had. It was madness that made sense, but had no place in a world of 
                  physical laws and concerns. My friends hated him. They thought he was 
                  just trying to be an arsehole. Or they thought he was retarded. He was 
                  always dirty because he hated to wash and sometimes he stank. So then 
                  we’d go down to one of the northern beaches at night and fuck in the 
                  ocean. There is a family of stingrays that live in that bay. They would 
                  gather, gliding into the bay in small sets to rest in the calm for the 
                  night. They sometimes brushed our heels as we left the water. Then when 
                  we got home and I was almost asleep, skin to skin with him, only several 
                  thousand grains of limey sand between us, he’d slide down and lick me 
                  with his steady salty tongue until I felt its every movement like the 
                  flood of a small wave over my body; so that when I came I fell through 
                  the weave of the sheets and lifted up through air particles and became 
                  everything, especially my cunt. Later when I gave birth to Josephine, 
                  my arms and legs shuddering and myself swimming from contraction to 
                  contraction breath by breath, I would become my womb. Just a giant contracting 
                  womb with head, arms and legs. With him, I was all cunt in the same 
                  way. In that period there were times when it felt like it was something 
                  of me, yet not of me. Like those strange sea hares you find washed up, 
                  looking like huge turgid vulvas; labia, clitoris, vagina, only with 
                  snail-like antennae. Beautiful purple-brown patterns. Mine was a creature 
                  of its own, and never before and never since has this happened, but 
                  it was as though he knew her better than I. So she was always surprising 
                  and contradicting me, what I thought was me, till she taught me I was 
                  her.</font></span> </p>

        layout-grid-mode:line'>As I write the book of me I am being written into the book 
                  of my life. A larger writing precedes me. These are nodes where they 
                  clash. Short circuit. My book is gone. I am looking at a novelty product. 
                  A book of blank pages. The cheapest paper, clearly a glue of splinters, 
                  already yellowing, already disintegrating. All this time, the best part 
                  of a dull weekend, I’ve sat here staring at a cheap marketing idea, 
                  trying to make something of the twee and banal. <i>Everything Men Know 
                  About Women</i>. A mulch of chemicals, some toxic, some benign, and 
                  the dust from milled trees. Their desiccated xylem, a little bleach 
                  and they can become anything. And there is that temptation to write. 
                  Several times I have picked up my pen to write one of my fragments. 
                  The sensation of the fragment, its life, evaporates before the pen even 
                  touches paper. Like those tiny insects that don’t even have a name. 
                  They appear on your skin, or on a letter you’re reading. They are white 
                  and they have wings and if you look carefully they look like miniature 
                  cicadas. They sit on a single hair on the back of your hand and preen 
                  themselves as comfortably as a monkey in a tree. No matter how careful 
                  you are you can’t pick one up without killing it. You can’t even brush 
                  it off. You are left with a pale greenish smear about the size of a 
                  pinhead on your paper, or silvery dust on the ridges of skin at your 
                  fingertips. The life and form and animation are gone. Just like that.</span></font></p>
