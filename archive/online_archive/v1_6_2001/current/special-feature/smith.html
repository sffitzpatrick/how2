          primarily interested in linguistic and structural experimentation, and 
          the extension of poetry into other genres and media. My verbal experiments 
          have included rhythmic notation of texts, constructed languages, and crossover 
          genres which combine poetry and prose. I have a strong commitment to performance 
          work, including sonic writing (semiotic exchange between music, words 
          and technology) and its gendered implications (sonic cross-dressing). 
          Some of my performance texts have taken the form of "techno-dramas" which 
          have fragmented narrative and dramatic elements, and also involve technological 
          manipulation of the voice. However, at the moment, I am particularly excited 
          about writing in hypermedia. I believe that the new media provide some 
          of the most challenging possibilities for innovative writing because they 
          allow labyrinthine linking of texts, animation of words, and the cross-over 
          of the visual, sonic and verbal within the single domain of the computer. 
          My writing is always multi-thematic and is increasingly triggered by theoretical 
          and historical reading. Lately it has focused on the convergence of collective 
          and individual memory, time-space compression, migration and the body. 
          Important influences on my writing have been my cross-cultural background 
          (a mixture of British and Australian with Jewish parentage) and my former 
          career as a professional musician. Collaboration interests me a great 
          deal because of the challenges it poses for subjectivity and autonomy, 
          and because it constantly widens my horizons. I am currently involved 
          in a number of multi-media collaborations, and also a ficto-critical one, 
          with writer and critic Anne Brewster, which blends theory with many other 
          genres of writing. </font></span>
