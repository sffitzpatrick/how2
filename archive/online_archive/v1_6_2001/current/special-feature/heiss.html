          don’t regard my writing as poetry as much as social observations and political 
          and personal statements that are not written in standard prose. My work 
          reflects the role of non-Indigenous people in Australia in identifying, 
          categorising and stereotyping Aboriginal people, particularly those within 
          urban environments. My life as a contemporary Koori woman, and all that 
          entails, provides me with the basis of much of my writing, which aims 
          to confront, educate and entertain the reader</font>.</span>
