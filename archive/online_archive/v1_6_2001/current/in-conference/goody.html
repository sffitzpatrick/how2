        do we read the work of Susan Howe? How does <i>The Non-Conformist's Memorial</i>,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">1</a><sup> 
        </sup>for example, position the reader? Does the activity required by 
        such works necessitate a reconceptualisation of the model of textual signification?</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>This paper explores Howe’s texts in an attempt to understand how 
        they invite the reader to participate in the production of meaning. The 
        “textology” I employ is adapted from current notions of “hypertext” and 
        aims to model and explain the functioning of Howe’s text in terms of the 
        role and subjectivity of the reader-position they call for. I am particularly 
        aware of the caution that must be employed on entering into the contemporary 
        debate about digital/electronic literature, hypertextuality and literary 
        theory. Most obviously I am wary of reifying the notion of <i>hypertext</i> 
        which has gained increasing prominence in common (literary) academic parlance 
        since the early work of George Landow,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">2</a> 
        and am concerned to avoid the “demon of analogy” that plagues many celebrations 
        of the World Wide Web’s ramifications for literature as the realisation 
        of contemporary theory. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">3</a> 
        I am also wary of the implication that Howe’s work should simply be transferred 
        to the digital medium (as will be argued later, the material medium is 
        an inextricable part of the “text” and so an electronic version of Howe 
        would amount to a translation of her work, the production of a different 
        but related “textual machine”).<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
title="">4</a> My intention is to establish a working, hypothetical idea of hypertext 
        that can be deployed to understand, analyse and realise the processes 
        of reading and writing foregrounded by experimental language or visual 
        poetry, in whatever media (I hesitate to apply a single label to Howe’s 
        work or to the broader types of texts I refer to).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>What then is <i>Hypertext</i>? Well, at the most basic level a 
        <i>hypertext</i> is a text constituted by different lexia (which can be 
        blocks of written text—words, addenda, notes, lines, sections—, sound, 
        animation, visual images or other forms of information) linked so that 
        readers make their own, interactive, choices as to what links or branches 
        to follow. A hypertext thus makes the reader aware of a bodily experience 
        (performance) of a text—the omnipresent eye/I of the reader is transformed 
        into the embodied activity of following certain links. This activity forces 
        a recognition of the historical location and material subjectivity of 
        the reader/writer as a necessary part of the (making) meaning of a text.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Hypertextual experiments, and the hypothesis of hypertextuality, 
        have profound implications for notions of the writing subject: perhaps 
        paradoxically (and in opposition to some naive postulations of the “virtual” 
        or digital as a transcendence of the body), the electronic (digital, disembodied) 
        hypertext can realise and foreground the embodiment of meaning in a text. 
        This is not to concur with the rhetoric of the unprecedented novelty of 
        digital textual forms, what Christopher Keep effusively describes as the 
        “alterity of the hypertext, the unassimilable excess upon which signification 
        depends.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">5</a>  For Keep, “[digital] 
        hypertextuality challenges the very possibility of totality upon which 
        the codex book depends. It demands, in short, a new body, one which finds 
        its pleasures not in the satisfactions of completion and enclosure, nor 
        in the stately assurances of the Cartesian <i>cogito</i>, but in the possibility 
        of connectivity and openess.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">6</a> 
        This description, I would argue, is just as applicable to a reading of 
        Howe’s <i>Singularities</i> (and perhaps more so) than to Michael Joyce’s 
        <i>Afternoon</i>: in what sense, for example, does <i>Articulation of 
        Sound Forms in Time</i> offer totality, completion, enclosure and the 
        stately assurances of the Cartesian <i>cogito</i>?<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">7</a></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>I want to attempt to clarify what I intend with my references to 
        ‘hypertext,’ taking heed of Espen Aarseth’s warning that “industrial terms 
        appropriated by analysts of technoculture [virtual, interactive, etc.] 
        [show] how commercial rhetoric is accepted uncritically by academics with 
        little concern for precise definitions or implicit ideologies.”<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title="">8</a> As with other theorists of hypertext, I am drawing 
        on actual experiments with texts and technologies,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"
title="">9</a> on the mode of linking documents on the World Wide Web that HTML 
        enables, and on the hypothetical notion of textuality that, as much recent 
        criticism has discussed, may well realise the speculations of contemporary 
        critical theory—it is this final notion of hypertextuality that I would 
        wish to explore. Hypertext itself, realisable in the coding language of 
        contemporary digital technology, can be traced back to Vannevar Bush’s 
        concept of a “memex,” originating in his 1945 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> 
        article<b> “</b>As we may think.<b>”</b><a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">10</a> 
        That hypertext can be implicitly conceived, without supporting technology, 
        suggests that what it does to texts, to textuality, is not a technological 
        innovation, but an unearthing of an implicit feature of writing itself. 
        Hypertext does appear to be a reality that was merely hypothesised by 
        literary and cultural theorists in the latter half of the twentieth century. 
        In <i>Hypertext 2.0 </i>George Landow considers the productive interface 
        or “convergence” between hypertext and contemporary critical theory:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The parallels 
          between computer hypertext and critical theory are of interest at many 
          points, the most important of which, perhaps, is that critical theory 
          promises to theorize hypertext and hypertext promises to embody and 
          thereby test aspects of theory, particularly those concerning textuality, 
          narrative, and the roles or functions of reader and writer.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">11</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However 
        a more accurate and productive idea to emerge from an analysis of cybertextuality 
        that refuses to maintain the artificial distinction between the codex 
        and the digital, is Aarseth’s model of the “textual machine.” In place 
        of the (linear) notion of author/sender, text/message, and reader/receiver, 
        Aarseth postulates a triangular symbiosis of “(verbal) sign,” “operator” 
        and “medium.”<a
href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">12</a> This model is certainly inspired 
        by Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” and the cyborg, as Haraway conceptualises 
        it from a distinctive feminist perspective, involves a blurring of boundaries 
        between animal and human, between self-controlled machine (automaton) 
        and human (ideal of autonomy), and an undermining of totalisation and 
        organic integrity.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">13</a> Particularly 
        pertinent here, as Aarseth acknowledges, is Haraway’s suggestion that 
        Writing “is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs.” </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The importance of Aarseth’s textual machine (and I will avoid, 
        for the purposes of this discussion, engaging with the full complexities 
        of the idea of “cybertext” itself) is twofold. Firstly it foregrounds 
        the place of the “reader” (or “operator”), distinct from Barthes’s somewhat 
        nebulous assertion of the active reader (“The Death of the Author”), as 
        a symbiotic part of the production of textual meaning, not as supremely 
        privileged subject. Secondly the importance of “medium” highlights the 
        fact that physical medium itself is part of the production of textual 
        meaning (this undermines the notion of the a reader engaging with “verbal 
        signs” in a vacuum). The previous “taken-for-grantedness” of “medium” 
        as Aarseth notes “is hardly strange, since it is only after we have started 
        to notice the ‘medium’ and its recent shifting appearances that we can 
        begin to observe the effect this instability has on the rest of the triangle.”<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">14</a><sup>  
        </sup>This becomes crucial because understanding that the material existence 
        of a text is not just “signs” but a group of physical (historical, located) 
        manifestations that the reader interacts with as a physical (historical, 
        located) subject, forces a recognition of material location of meaning—this 
        means <i>x </i>for me here and now if I do this (turn this page, read 
        this section), if I take it somewhere else and do something else it may 
        mean <i>y</i>. This might almost be a banal revelation (If I read <i>Moby 
        Dick</i> on the deck of a ship on the Atlantic it might well mean something 
        different when I read it in the reference section of a University library), 
        if it did not serve to undermine some still persistent notions of where 
        textual meaning originates.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>The notion of the hypertextual I am deploying, then, is a way of 
        conceptualising disrupted texts that are open to contingent and divergent 
        readings; textual machines that require active participation. Crucially, 
        a text understood in this way escapes what G<span lang=FR style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>é</span>rard Genette describes as “a sort of idolatry…the fetishism of the work—conceived 
        of as a closed, complete, absolute object.”<a
href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">15</a><sup> </sup> This is not to say 
        that the meaning of a hypertext is a random effect. As Jerome McGann points 
        out, hypertext is decentralised and non-hierarchical, providing “the means 
        for establishing an indefinite number of ‘centres,’ and for expanding 
        their number as well as altering their relationships.” So, although not 
        centrally organised, a hypertext does have “governing order(s)” and it 
        “need never be complete.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">16</a>  
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Within the context of hypertext, the idea of “performance” is radically 
        redescribed as the text itself is performed through the act of reading/using.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">17</a> 
        The “reader” actively participates in the act(ion) of meaning, rather 
        than consuming a reified fetishised text. The implications of hypertext 
        are particularly pertinent to understanding how the paradoxes of the poetry 
        of Susan Howe can, rather than be resolved, or read as an uneasy straddling 
        of “the lines between modern and postmodern poetries,”<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">18</a> 
        actually productively co-exist. Howe’s poetry—which strives for both an 
        avant-garde interrogation of referentiality and for a feminist (cultural 
        materialist) critique—will be used to exemplify how a hypertextual “performance” 
        necessitates embodiment and agency, overcoming the infinite regress of 
        postmodern subjectivity without reproducing the privileged lyric subject 
        of modernist poetics.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>A recent attempt to translate poetry to the computer screen is 
        Penny Florence and Jason Whittaker’s CD-Rom of Mallarm<span lang=FR style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>é</span>’s <i>Un Coup de des</i>,<a href="#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" title="">19</a> a text that clearly explores the signifying possibilities 
        of the page (visual and semantic) through its use of typography, spacing, 
        layout and so on. As Whittaker comments, “the computer intrinsically dramatises 
        text, inviting interaction and imagination by refusing to fix it.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">20</a> 
        Thus, Mallarmé’s poem is animated (in this case through the use of sound, 
        different speeds for following the text, the ability to manoeuvre or highlight 
        words or sections, and so on) and is released from the stasis of art object 
        into a realm of dynamic reading. This is not to say that the piece is 
        radically altered or “modernised,” as “transposing this poem into virtual 
        space actually facilitates the kind of reading it formally demands, but 
        which paper renders obscure and difficult to realise.”<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">21</a> 
        The change in medium, therefore, is not fundamental, but demonstrates 
        the characteristics that are shared across the supposed codex-electronic 
        divide. </font></p>
      <p style='
line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Pieces like <i>Un Coup de des</i> not only make the reader active 
        (it is obviously the type of text whose “unity lies not in its origin 
        but in its destination”) but they also actually resist closure, certainty, 
        a single, pre-set unity that the knowing reader can activate. Any unity 
        that is achieved by the reader of such texts, no matter what claims might 
        be made by critical exegesis, is particular, contingent, local and liable 
        to instant disturbance or reconfiguration. The reader (producer/writer) 
        plays a fully active role in creating the text, but it is only a temporary 
        text, a one-off trajectory of reading/writing, a performance which might 
        be reiterated, but is not fixed, solidified, in/by any script. The “voice,” 
        which speaks/performs the words and sounds of such hypertext poetry is 
        not a privileged authorial subject, nor a simulacrum of subjective expression, 
        but the localised agency of an actual individual physically constructing 
        a pathway between lexia (activating sounds or images—stills or animation—linking 
        to a dictionary definition, highlighting a single word, over viewing a 
        whole page as pattern, rotating it, viewing 2,3 4…pages/sections simultaneously, 
        linking to addenda, manuscripts, and so on) making the text. The performance 
        of hypertext thus suggests a radical revisioning of what performativity 
        might be—the actions of a unique subject in forming meaning, rather than 
        the acting out of a pre-existing form.</font></p>
      <p style='
line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>It is clear that the hypothetical hypertext performance I am invoking 
        is not an exact reflection of the reality of current experiments with 
        poetry in the digital realm. In practice the hard-coding of an interactive 
        poetry site or CD-Rom text creates a closed unit, as Whittaker comments 
        on their <i>Un Coup de des text</i>:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our version 
          of <i>Un Coup de Des</i> is not, strictly speaking hypertext, certainly 
          not in the same form as is found on the World Wide Web: in particularly 
          it is a fairly closed system (a CD-Rom), although one virtue of using 
          Director [the application used to convert <i>Un Coup de des</i>] is 
          that it is a standard that is supported on the Web.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">22</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='
line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span> </span>Indeed, 
        the programmer or converter of a poetic text into multimedia by coding 
        a finite number of links or possible lines of navigation, can be seen 
        as acting, if not as an implicit “author,” then as a critical exegesist 
        coding in all the possible paths of reading. However, the technological 
        restrictions on the actual production of an unbounded hypertext do not 
        detract from the theoretical importance of this idea for the understanding 
        of texts. Crucially, the experience of navigating a hypertext is the experience 
        of producing a unique and personal trajectory of reading, one which is, 
        in practice, one of a very large number of possible pathways. In addition 
        the experience of following hyperlinks on the Web, or accessing a hypermedia 
        text, illustrates how a personal trajectory of reading may be one of an 
        infinite number of possibilities which continually change, rearrange and 
        reconfigure.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">23</a></font></p>

        </span> Understood through such an experience of reading, which leaves 
        the static page far behind, certain types of poetry can be seen to be 
        fundamentally challenging the authority of meaning, the logic of reason, 
        the order of production. At the same time, in moving away from the page 
        as the tabula rasa receptor for the divine inspiration of authorial subjectivity, 
        hypertext escapes from the specular economy which is also the commodification 
        of meaning (I can own that author’s words). Not only does the pre-eminence 
        of <i>parole</i> collapse into the ever-presence of <i>langue</i>, but 
        also language and meaning become fully implicated in a tactile network 
        of production:</font></p>

          is McLuhan’s “integral sense,” putting itself and all the others in

        many critics have argued “There is no loss of body in and through virtual

        those “memory traces, called up by the body, parts of the body themselves” 
        which “allow us to experience with our physical selves and all the other 
        multiple layers that constitute us in ways that do not require us to be

        the ownership of meaning and allow for the “redaction” of unauthorised 
        histories.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">26</a> I intend 
        to demonstrate this effect by turning to the work of Susan Howe and exploring 
        how her poetry opens up a space for denied voices, repressed meanings 
        and marginalised histories. Howe’s poetry re-presents the corporeality 
        and fluidity of meaning which has been trapped by the normalising (and 
        transcendent) effects of a blindness to the materiality of the printed 
        book. It is not simply that her poetry endows the reader with a sense 
        of agency, the cultural and historical locatedness of readers forming 
        part of the meaning of their (Howe) text (although this is of course of 
        vital importance), but that language itself is realised as tactile and 
        physical, as material marks that the reader engages with and manipulates. 
        Thus, rather than being read as “puzzles with answers” motivated by “modernist” 
        intentions that belie the “distinctly avant-garde surfaces,”<a
href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">27</a> Howe’s poetry (and other texts)

        </span>It is with <i>Melville’s Marginalia </i>(published in <i>The Nonconformist’s 
        Memorial</i>, 1993), that we are clearly offered a “poem” that is generated 
        out of a hypertextual interface between texts, histories, biographies, 
        notes, memories. <i>Melville’s Marginalia</i> takes as its starting point 
        an incidental encounter which recalls Vannevar Bush’s notion of the memex 
        as a system of bibliographic information retrieval:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">During 
          the Spring of 1991 I was teaching <i>Billy Budd</i> for a graduate seminar 
          in Philadelphia. One day while searching through Melville criticism 
          at the Temple University Library I noticed two maroon dictionary-size 
          volumes, lying haphazardly, out of reach, almost out of sight on the 
          topmost shelf. That’s how I found <i>Melville’s Marginalia</i> or <i>Melville’s 
          Marginalia</i> found me.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">31</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Only the 
          pages Melville marked in each book are included so there is little forward 
          trajectory to whatever novel, narrative, or poem. Each marked passage 
          is a literal transcription from the particular edition Melville used. 
          Because Cowen used each original’s type-set line-lengths, prose often 
          looks like poetry. Texts in the <i>Marginalia</i> are alphabetically 
          arranged by an author’s name so authors and writers meet by letter (<i>Marginalia</i>, 
          90).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
        poem then creates multiple trajectories from this already multiple, disrupted 
        text, tracing lines through memories and histories, coming, for example, 
        to the allusive figure of James Clarence Mangan through a variety of paths 
        and creating a text that enables the reader to “browse” as Mangan does 
        as a librarian (“Instead of classifying / he browsed and dreamed / he 
        didn’t even browse / <i>regularly</i>”)(<i>Marginalia</i>, 127; <i>my 
        emphasis</i>).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>Cowen’s “Marginalia” becomes the formal, but also ideological, 
        prototype for Howe’s <i>Marginalia</i>: not just the source of inspiration 
        but a mode of constructing a text that refuses to establish a hierarchy 
        (between personal, subjective expression and direct secondary quotation—between 
        authoritative statement and playful speculation, for example). We are 
        shown Cowen’s co-option into the “authorized” “<i>Harvard Dissertations 
        in American and English Literature</i>, Edited by Stephen Orgel, Stanford 
        University, A Garland Series,” the text commenting that this seems “to 
        emphasise the difference between dissertations and books or between graduate 
        students and professors”(<i>Marginalia</i>, 91): we are posed the question 
        “What is a parenthesis”(<i>Marginalia</i>, 130). At the same time as refusing 
        hierarchy and privilege, Howe’s <i>Marginalia</i> resists narrative continuity, 
        closure and certainty. The suggestion of a critical detective uncovering 
        the “source” of Melville’s Bartleby the Scrivner is just one pathway in 
        the text, one link that might be followed, but is no more <i>the</i> theme 
        of the poem than is a childhood memory of a great-aunt’s garden beside 
        Killiney Bay near Dublin.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>An example from another of Howe’s texts, a double-page from “Thorow” 
        that appears at the beginning of the third section,<a
href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">32</a> demonstrates easily how the experience 
        of reading Howe requires active participation. These pages might well 
        be an exploration of American history and the mythical construction and 
        appropriation of the American landscape (by Native Americans and French 
        colonisers), the conflict of two opposed world views attempting to inhabit 
        the same space (hence the pages’ layout), the rewriting of the America 
        (the title “Thorow”/Thoreau), the role of language in actually creating 
        a world (or at least signifying whose world this is), the traces of lost 
        or marginalised histories (“hieroglyph, Picked up arrowhead”)…but the 
        only way it can mean is if I (the reader) interact with the text and “virtually” 
        write it. This extract from “Thorow” embodies movement and multi-layers, 
        the reader must navigate and animate what they have before them, enter 
        into it, not to be subsumed by any privileged lyric voice, but to engage 
        in the construction of their own paths of meaning—we might want to invert 
        the pages, or follow one of the columns of nouns, or explore the differences 
        between the two pages, or look up words or fragments in a dictionary, 
        or play around with what “c o v er y” might be doing. We perform the text, 
        each in our own way, from our own subject position. As McCorkle observes: 
        “Howe’s poetics underscores […] the necessity of developing a pluralistic, 
        participatory […] modality of reading”; “Howe presents the reader with 
        a series of choices, not meaninglessness, but a series of choices whose 
        reading will be dependent upon the cultural and historical positioning 
        of the individual reader.”<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">33</a>  
        We are not solving a riddle, or attempting to find the hidden rational 
        structure under such poems (there is no grammar to learn here).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>I am not trying to assert that such pieces deliberately attempt 
        to reproduce the effects of digital technology, or that they should simply 
        be transposed onto the computer screen for better ease of reading. What 
        I hope to demonstrate is the extent to which theorising such poems as 
        “hypertext” foregrounds the necessity of interaction with an actual, situated 
        reader.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
        </span>What I am pointing to in the work of Susan Howe clearly resonates 
        with the statements of other critics and readers and with Howe’s own sense 
        of textuality as “a field of free transgressive prediscovery”:<a

      <blockquote>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her ways

          between words, push back their branches in order to discover their interpenetration, 
          then allow them to bend again toward each other, or to swing away. As 
          I look at each word anew, I think these are the parts, now what is the 
          greater whole? ­ A living text with a life of its own, ever transforming

title="">37</a> I would, in contrast, argue that they can only mean when we want 
        them to mean (they don’t have meaning outside the presence of us). Just 
        as the reality of the Net is not a transcendence of identity, but liberation 
        from the rigid subjectivities underpinning the economy of exchange, poetry, 
        like Howe’s, is not about either/or, mine/yours, subject/object, but about 
        “networks and contacts which need no centralised organisation and evade 
        its structures of command and control.”<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">38</a>

          Kathryn Sutherland (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997) 41.  McGann’s comments 
          certainly resonate with Howe’s own statements; “I always think of my 
          work in terms of separate poems in one long poem—that each page (usually 
          it’s a page) can stand alone and together: one reason for calling my 
          book <i>Singularities</i>. So although on one level I think the order 
          can’t be broken up, on another I mean it to be able to be broken.” “Postscripts

          is J. Yellowlees Douglas’s analogy of the author of hypertexts as playwrights;

          (“Writing Multiplicity: Hypertext and Feminist Textual Politics,” <i>Computers 
          and Composition</i> 16. 1 (1999)) highlight the difficulties in actually 
          realising a feminist politic in the face of the “mechanisms of discursive 
          authority” which are not simply transcended in the hypertextual environment, 
          particularly as the “production of language forces the text to be written 
          one word at a time”(67). This perhaps banal, but certainly crucial, 
          point highlights the invalidity of asserting an absolute difference 
          between the electronic hypertext and the nonlinear codex (at their point 
          of production).</font></p>
