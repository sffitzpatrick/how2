          </sup>for example, position the reader? Does the activity required by 
          such works necessitate a reconceptualisation of the model of textual signification?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>This paper explores Howe’s texts in an attempt to understand how 
          they invite the reader to participate in the production of meaning. The 
          “textology” I employ is adapted from current notions of “hypertext” and 
          aims to model and explain the functioning of Howe’s text in terms of the 
          role and subjectivity of the reader-position they call for. I am particularly 
          aware of the caution that must be employed on entering into the contemporary 
          debate about digital/electronic literature, hypertextuality and literary 
          theory. Most obviously I am wary of reifying the notion of <i>hypertext</i> 
          which has gained increasing prominence in common (literary) academic parlance 
          since the early work of George Landow,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">2</a> 
          and am concerned to avoid the “demon of analogy” that plagues many celebrations 
          of the World Wide Web’s ramifications for literature as the realisation 
          of contemporary theory. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">3</a> 
          I am also wary of the implication that Howe’s work should simply be transferred 
          to the digital medium (as will be argued later, the material medium is 
          an inextricable part of the “text” and so an electronic version of Howe 
          would amount to a translation of her work, the production of a different 
          but related “textual machine”).<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
  title="">4</a> My intention is to establish a working, hypothetical idea of hypertext 
          that can be deployed to understand, analyse and realise the processes 
          of reading and writing foregrounded by experimental language or visual 
          poetry, in whatever media (I hesitate to apply a single label to Howe’s 
          work or to the broader types of texts I refer to).</font></p>

          </span>What then is <i>Hypertext</i>? Well, at the most basic level a 
          <i>hypertext</i> is a text constituted by different lexia (which can be 
          blocks of written text—words, addenda, notes, lines, sections—, sound, 
          animation, visual images or other forms of information) linked so that 
          readers make their own, interactive, choices as to what links or branches 
          to follow. A hypertext thus makes the reader aware of a bodily experience 
          (performance) of a text—the omnipresent eye/I of the reader is transformed 
          into the embodied activity of following certain links. This activity forces 
          a recognition of the historical location and material subjectivity of 
          the reader/writer as a necessary part of the (making) meaning of a text.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Hypertextual experiments, and the hypothesis of hypertextuality, 
          have profound implications for notions of the writing subject: perhaps 
          paradoxically (and in opposition to some naive postulations of the “virtual” 
          or digital as a transcendence of the body), the electronic (digital, disembodied) 
          hypertext can realise and foreground the embodiment of meaning in a text. 
          This is not to concur with the rhetoric of the unprecedented novelty of 
          digital textual forms, what Christopher Keep effusively describes as the 
          “alterity of the hypertext, the unassimilable excess upon which signification 
          depends.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">5</a>  For Keep, “[digital] 
          hypertextuality challenges the very possibility of totality upon which 
          the codex book depends. It demands, in short, a new body, one which finds 
          its pleasures not in the satisfactions of completion and enclosure, nor 
          in the stately assurances of the Cartesian <i>cogito</i>, but in the possibility 
          of connectivity and openess.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">6</a> 
          This description, I would argue, is just as applicable to a reading of 
          Howe’s <i>Singularities</i> (and perhaps more so) than to Michael Joyce’s 
          <i>Afternoon</i>: in what sense, for example, does <i>Articulation of 
          Sound Forms in Time</i> offer totality, completion, enclosure and the 
          stately assurances of the Cartesian <i>cogito</i>?<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">7</a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I want to attempt to clarify what I intend with my references to 
          ‘hypertext,’ taking heed of Espen Aarseth’s warning that “industrial terms 
          appropriated by analysts of technoculture [virtual, interactive, etc.] 
          [show] how commercial rhetoric is accepted uncritically by academics with 
          little concern for precise definitions or implicit ideologies.”<a href="#_edn8"
  name="_ednref8" title="">8</a> As with other theorists of hypertext, I am drawing 
          on actual experiments with texts and technologies,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"
  title="">9</a> on the mode of linking documents on the World Wide Web that HTML 
          enables, and on the hypothetical notion of textuality that, as much recent 
          criticism has discussed, may well realise the speculations of contemporary 
          critical theory—it is this final notion of hypertextuality that I would 
          wish to explore. Hypertext itself, realisable in the coding language of 
          contemporary digital technology, can be traced back to Vannevar Bush’s 
          concept of a “memex,” originating in his 1945 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> 
          article<b> “</b>As we may think.<b>”</b><a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">10</a> 
          That hypertext can be implicitly conceived, without supporting technology, 
          suggests that what it does to texts, to textuality, is not a technological 
          innovation, but an unearthing of an implicit feature of writing itself. 
          Hypertext does appear to be a reality that was merely hypothesised by 
          literary and cultural theorists in the latter half of the twentieth century. 
          In <i>Hypertext 2.0 </i>George Landow considers the productive interface 
          or “convergence” between hypertext and contemporary critical theory:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The parallels 
            between computer hypertext and critical theory are of interest at many 
            points, the most important of which, perhaps, is that critical theory 
            promises to theorize hypertext and hypertext promises to embody and 
            thereby test aspects of theory, particularly those concerning textuality, 
            narrative, and the roles or functions of reader and writer.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">11</a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However 
          a more accurate and productive idea to emerge from an analysis of cybertextuality 
          that refuses to maintain the artificial distinction between the codex 
          and the digital, is Aarseth’s model of the “textual machine.” In place 
          of the (linear) notion of author/sender, text/message, and reader/receiver, 
          Aarseth postulates a triangular symbiosis of “(verbal) sign,” “operator” 
          and “medium.”<a
  href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">12</a> This model is certainly inspired 
          by Donna Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” and the cyborg, as Haraway conceptualises 
          it from a distinctive feminist perspective, involves a blurring of boundaries 
          between animal and human, between self-controlled machine (automaton) 
          and human (ideal of autonomy), and an undermining of totalisation and 
          organic integrity.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">13</a> Particularly 
          pertinent here, as Aarseth acknowledges, is Haraway’s suggestion that 
          Writing “is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The importance of Aarseth’s textual machine (and I will avoid, 
          for the purposes of this discussion, engaging with the full complexities 
          of the idea of “cybertext” itself) is twofold. Firstly it foregrounds 
          the place of the “reader” (or “operator”), distinct from Barthes’s somewhat 
          nebulous assertion of the active reader (“The Death of the Author”), as 
          a symbiotic part of the production of textual meaning, not as supremely 
          privileged subject. Secondly the importance of “medium” highlights the 
          fact that physical medium itself is part of the production of textual 
          meaning (this undermines the notion of the a reader engaging with “verbal 
          signs” in a vacuum). The previous “taken-for-grantedness” of “medium” 
          as Aarseth notes “is hardly strange, since it is only after we have started 
          to notice the ‘medium’ and its recent shifting appearances that we can 
          begin to observe the effect this instability has on the rest of the triangle.”<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">14</a><sup>  
          </sup>This becomes crucial because understanding that the material existence 
          of a text is not just “signs” but a group of physical (historical, located) 
          manifestations that the reader interacts with as a physical (historical, 
          located) subject, forces a recognition of material location of meaning—this 
          means <i>x </i>for me here and now if I do this (turn this page, read 
          this section), if I take it somewhere else and do something else it may 
          mean <i>y</i>. This might almost be a banal revelation (If I read <i>Moby 
          Dick</i> on the deck of a ship on the Atlantic it might well mean something 
          different when I read it in the reference section of a University library), 
          if it did not serve to undermine some still persistent notions of where 
          textual meaning originates.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The notion of the hypertextual I am deploying, then, is a way of 
          conceptualising disrupted texts that are open to contingent and divergent 
          readings; textual machines that require active participation. Crucially, 
          a text understood in this way escapes what G<span lang=FR style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
  '>é</span>rard Genette describes as “a sort of idolatry…the fetishism of the work—conceived 
          of as a closed, complete, absolute object.”<a
  href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">15</a><sup> </sup> This is not to say 
          that the meaning of a hypertext is a random effect. As Jerome McGann points 
          out, hypertext is decentralised and non-hierarchical, providing “the means 
          for establishing an indefinite number of ‘centres,’ and for expanding 
          their number as well as altering their relationships.” So, although not 
          centrally organised, a hypertext does have “governing order(s)” and it 
          “need never be complete.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">16</a>  
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Within the context of hypertext, the idea of “performance” is radically 
          redescribed as the text itself is performed through the act of reading/using.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">17</a> 
          The “reader” actively participates in the act(ion) of meaning, rather 
          than consuming a reified fetishised text. The implications of hypertext 
          are particularly pertinent to understanding how the paradoxes of the poetry 
          of Susan Howe can, rather than be resolved, or read as an uneasy straddling 
          of “the lines between modern and postmodern poetries,”<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">18</a> 
          actually productively co-exist. Howe’s poetry—which strives for both an 
          avant-garde interrogation of referentiality and for a feminist (cultural 
          materialist) critique—will be used to exemplify how a hypertextual “performance” 
          necessitates embodiment and agency, overcoming the infinite regress of 
          postmodern subjectivity without reproducing the privileged lyric subject 
          of modernist poetics.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>A recent attempt to translate poetry to the computer screen is 
          Penny Florence and Jason Whittaker’s CD-Rom of Mallarm<span lang=FR style='font-family:
  &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>é</span>’s <i>Un Coup de des</i>,<a href="#_edn19"
  name="_ednref19" title="">19</a> a text that clearly explores the signifying possibilities 
          of the page (visual and semantic) through its use of typography, spacing, 
          layout and so on. As Whittaker comments, “the computer intrinsically dramatises 
          text, inviting interaction and imagination by refusing to fix it.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">20</a> 
          Thus, Mallarmé’s poem is animated (in this case through the use of sound, 
          different speeds for following the text, the ability to manoeuvre or highlight 
          words or sections, and so on) and is released from the stasis of art object 
          into a realm of dynamic reading. This is not to say that the piece is 
          radically altered or “modernised,” as “transposing this poem into virtual 
          space actually facilitates the kind of reading it formally demands, but 
          which paper renders obscure and difficult to realise.”<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">21</a> 
          The change in medium, therefore, is not fundamental, but demonstrates 
          the characteristics that are shared across the supposed codex-electronic 
          divide. </font></p>
        <p style='
  line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Pieces like <i>Un Coup de des</i> not only make the reader active 
          (it is obviously the type of text whose “unity lies not in its origin 
          but in its destination”) but they also actually resist closure, certainty, 
          a single, pre-set unity that the knowing reader can activate. Any unity 
          that is achieved by the reader of such texts, no matter what claims might 
          be made by critical exegesis, is particular, contingent, local and liable 
          to instant disturbance or reconfiguration. The reader (producer/writer) 
          plays a fully active role in creating the text, but it is only a temporary 
          text, a one-off trajectory of reading/writing, a performance which might 
          be reiterated, but is not fixed, solidified, in/by any script. The “voice,” 
          which speaks/performs the words and sounds of such hypertext poetry is 
          not a privileged authorial subject, nor a simulacrum of subjective expression, 
          but the localised agency of an actual individual physically constructing 
          a pathway between lexia (activating sounds or images—stills or animation—linking 
          to a dictionary definition, highlighting a single word, over viewing a 
          whole page as pattern, rotating it, viewing 2,3 4…pages/sections simultaneously, 
          linking to addenda, manuscripts, and so on) making the text. The performance 
          of hypertext thus suggests a radical revisioning of what performativity 
          might be—the actions of a unique subject in forming meaning, rather than 
          the acting out of a pre-existing form.</font></p>

          </span>It is clear that the hypothetical hypertext performance I am invoking 
          is not an exact reflection of the reality of current experiments with 
          poetry in the digital realm. In practice the hard-coding of an interactive 
          poetry site or CD-Rom text creates a closed unit, as Whittaker comments 
          on their <i>Un Coup de des text</i>:</font></p>

            not in the same form as is found on the World Wide Web: in particularly 
            it is a fairly closed system (a CD-Rom), although one virtue of using 
            Director [the application used to convert <i>Un Coup de des</i>] is 
            that it is a standard that is supported on the Web.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">22</a></font></p>

        <p style='

          the programmer or converter of a poetic text into multimedia by coding 
          a finite number of links or possible lines of navigation, can be seen 
          as acting, if not as an implicit “author,” then as a critical exegesist 
          coding in all the possible paths of reading. However, the technological 
          restrictions on the actual production of an unbounded hypertext do not 
          detract from the theoretical importance of this idea for the understanding 
          of texts. Crucially, the experience of navigating a hypertext is the experience 
          of producing a unique and personal trajectory of reading, one which is, 
          in practice, one of a very large number of possible pathways. In addition 
          the experience of following hyperlinks on the Web, or accessing a hypermedia 
          text, illustrates how a personal trajectory of reading may be one of an 
          infinite number of possibilities which continually change, rearrange and 
          reconfigure.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">23</a></font></p>

          the static page far behind, certain types of poetry can be seen to be 
          fundamentally challenging the authority of meaning, the logic of reason, 
          the order of production. At the same time, in moving away from the page 
          as the tabula rasa receptor for the divine inspiration of authorial subjectivity, 
          hypertext escapes from the specular economy which is also the commodification 
          of meaning (I can own that author’s words). Not only does the pre-eminence 
          of <i>parole</i> collapse into the ever-presence of <i>langue</i>, but 
          also language and meaning become fully implicated in a tactile network

          </span>What hypertext realises, then, is the necessary role of the reader 
          in the production of meaning—not simply through some abstract Barthesian

          as the actual, only and firmly embodied place where meaning can be engendered.

          </span>I choose the word engendered deliberately because I want to bring 
          into play the gendered implications of hypertextual performance and hypertext 
          poetry, specifically how they can serve to undo textual hierarchies, challenge 
          the ownership of meaning and allow for the “redaction” of unauthorised 
          histories.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">26</a> I intend 
          to demonstrate this effect by turning to the work of Susan Howe and exploring 
          how her poetry opens up a space for denied voices, repressed meanings 
          and marginalised histories. Howe’s poetry re-presents the corporeality 
          and fluidity of meaning which has been trapped by the normalising (and 
          transcendent) effects of a blindness to the materiality of the printed 
          book. It is not simply that her poetry endows the reader with a sense 
          of agency, the cultural and historical locatedness of readers forming 
          part of the meaning of their (Howe) text (although this is of course of 
          vital importance), but that language itself is realised as tactile and 
          physical, as material marks that the reader engages with and manipulates. 
          Thus, rather than being read as “puzzles with answers” motivated by “modernist” 
          intentions that belie the “distinctly avant-garde surfaces,”<a
  href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">27</a> Howe’s poetry (and other texts) 
          require that the reader navigate their own path through the physical marks 
          of meaning.</font></p>

          notes, memories. <i>Melville’s Marginalia</i> takes as its starting point 
          an incidental encounter which recalls Vannevar Bush’s notion of the memex 
          as a system of bibliographic information retrieval:</font></p>

            the Spring of 1991 I was teaching <i>Billy Budd</i> for a graduate seminar 
            in Philadelphia. One day while searching through Melville criticism 
            at the Temple University Library I noticed two maroon dictionary-size 
            volumes, lying haphazardly, out of reach, almost out of sight on the 
            topmost shelf. That’s how I found <i>Melville’s Marginalia</i> or <i>Melville’s 
            Marginalia</i> found me.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">31</a></font></p>

            is a literal transcription from the particular edition Melville used. 
            Because Cowen used each original’s type-set line-lengths, prose often 
            looks like poetry. Texts in the <i>Marginalia</i> are alphabetically 
            arranged by an author’s name so authors and writers meet by letter (<i>Marginalia</i>, 
            90).</font></p>

          text, tracing lines through memories and histories, coming, for example, 
          to the allusive figure of James Clarence Mangan through a variety of paths 
          and creating a text that enables the reader to “browse” as Mangan does 
          as a librarian (“Instead of classifying / he browsed and dreamed / he 
          didn’t even browse / <i>regularly</i>”)(<i>Marginalia</i>, 127; <i>my

          </span>Cowen’s “Marginalia” becomes the formal, but also ideological, 
          prototype for Howe’s <i>Marginalia</i>: not just the source of inspiration 
          but a mode of constructing a text that refuses to establish a hierarchy 
          (between personal, subjective expression and direct secondary quotation—between 
          authoritative statement and playful speculation, for example). We are 
          shown Cowen’s co-option into the “authorized” “<i>Harvard Dissertations 
          in American and English Literature</i>, Edited by Stephen Orgel, Stanford 
          University, A Garland Series,” the text commenting that this seems “to 
          emphasise the difference between dissertations and books or between graduate 
          students and professors”(<i>Marginalia</i>, 91): we are posed the question 
          “What is a parenthesis”(<i>Marginalia</i>, 130). At the same time as refusing 
          hierarchy and privilege, Howe’s <i>Marginalia</i> resists narrative continuity, 
          closure and certainty. The suggestion of a critical detective uncovering 
          the “source” of Melville’s Bartleby the Scrivner is just one pathway in 
          the text, one link that might be followed, but is no more <i>the</i> theme 
          of the poem than is a childhood memory of a great-aunt’s garden beside 
          Killiney Bay near Dublin.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>An example from another of Howe’s texts, a double-page from “Thorow” 
          that appears at the beginning of the third section,<a
  href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">32</a> demonstrates easily how the experience 
          of reading Howe requires active participation. These pages might well 
          be an exploration of American history and the mythical construction and 
          appropriation of the American landscape (by Native Americans and French 
          colonisers), the conflict of two opposed world views attempting to inhabit 
          the same space (hence the pages’ layout), the rewriting of the America 
          (the title “Thorow”/Thoreau), the role of language in actually creating 
          a world (or at least signifying whose world this is), the traces of lost 
          or marginalised histories (“hieroglyph, Picked up arrowhead”)…but the 
          only way it can mean is if I (the reader) interact with the text and “virtually” 
          write it. This extract from “Thorow” embodies movement and multi-layers, 
          the reader must navigate and animate what they have before them, enter 
          into it, not to be subsumed by any privileged lyric voice, but to engage 
          in the construction of their own paths of meaning—we might want to invert 
          the pages, or follow one of the columns of nouns, or explore the differences 
          between the two pages, or look up words or fragments in a dictionary, 
          or play around with what “c o v er y” might be doing. We perform the text, 
          each in our own way, from our own subject position. As McCorkle observes: 
          “Howe’s poetics underscores […] the necessity of developing a pluralistic, 
          participatory […] modality of reading”; “Howe presents the reader with 
          a series of choices, not meaninglessness, but a series of choices whose 
          reading will be dependent upon the cultural and historical positioning 
          of the individual reader.”<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">33</a>  
          We are not solving a riddle, or attempting to find the hidden rational 
          structure under such poems (there is no grammar to learn here).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I am not trying to assert that such pieces deliberately attempt 
          to reproduce the effects of digital technology, or that they should simply 
          be transposed onto the computer screen for better ease of reading. What 
          I hope to demonstrate is the extent to which theorising such poems as 
          “hypertext” foregrounds the necessity of interaction with an actual, situated 
          reader.</font></p>

          with the statements of other critics and readers and with Howe’s own sense

            between words, push back their branches in order to discover their interpenetration, 
            then allow them to bend again toward each other, or to swing away. As 
            I look at each word anew, I think these are the parts, now what is the 
            greater whole? ­ A living text with a life of its own, ever transforming

            is, as Aarseth describes, “the race […] to conquer and colonize […]

            form of ‘the theoretical perspective of &lt;fill in your favorite theory/theoretician

            certainly resonate with Howe’s own statements; “I always think of my 
            work in terms of separate poems in one long poem—that each page (usually 
            it’s a page) can stand alone and together: one reason for calling my

            can’t be broken up, on another I mean it to be able to be broken.” “Postscripts

            realising a feminist politic in the face of the “mechanisms of discursive 
            authority” which are not simply transcended in the hypertextual environment, 
            particularly as the “production of language forces the text to be written 
            one word at a time”(67). This perhaps banal, but certainly crucial, 
            point highlights the invalidity of asserting an absolute difference 
            between the electronic hypertext and the nonlinear codex (at their point
