        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          colloquium from which the following papers were gathered took place at 
          Oxford Brookes University, where a Centre for Modern and Contemporary 
          Poetry has very recently been established.  The event was organized by 
          myself, Romana Huk, during the leave I have secured from the University 
          of New Hampshire in the States in order to work, as a two-year research 
          fellow, to help jump-start the Centre and give its activities the beginnings 
          of what its directors hope will be an ever-developing international scope.</font> 
          <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Given my 
          other charge to attempt to make Brookes a place where traditionally antagonistic 
          strands of poetry writing in the U.K. could at least meet and argue, if 
          not find shared points of departure, I chose a topic with which every 
          camp of work—“avant-garde” and  “mainstream,” black British and regionalist, 
          etc.—has been concerned: rereading the concept of “presence” in performance, 
          and the impact of such study on electronic as well as theatre and film 
          modes for poetry.   Such debates about presence—and “liveness” in mediatized 
          performance—constitute issues of acute importance for avant-garde women’s 
          poetry, as the number of powerful women writers present at this small 
          colloquium would suggest.  The necessity of rethinking identity politics 
          and their impact on the social sphere according to newly located and temporalized 
          rather than “generic” models of difference makes the collocation of performance 
          discourse (with its re-<i>placement</i> of the female body) and those 
          of gender politicking seem exhilarating and timely.  This is particularly 
          so given the range of new media and modes in which to experiment with 
          what Caroline Bergvall refers to as the context-specific and continually 
          moving quantity of “presentness” rather than “presence.”  Obviously not 
          every paper at the colloquium was engaged specifically with gender issues, 
          but all that spoke clearly to its focus became key in the project of refiguring 
          identity at the intersection between textual and spatial relations—of 
          reading the latter back into the former and beginning to contemplate the 
          private as the pivotal edge in that implicit triangle of interactions.</font>

         <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          range of responses that emerged during the colloquium to this problem 
          of re-valuing the material presence of the author or speaker in space 
          and time, and the implications of such valuations for electronic work, 
          would be impossible to represent here, in part because many of the presentations 
          were themselves performances rather than written/reproducible texts—John 
          Cayley’s demonstration of how the electronic modes of his own works enhance 
          rather than depart from variously embodied and codex-oriented experiment, 
          for example, or Joan Retallack’s play with memory and “liveness” via recorded 
          fragments of John Cage’s voice/laughter, or Tony Lopez’s making of a “talk 
          poem,” styled after David Antin’s experiments with the same, or Patience 
          Agbabi’s discussion of the difficulties faced in performing her new collage 
          piece made out of testimonials and responses (i.e., bits of “personal 
          witness”) elicited from victims and observers of the Alder Hey organ scandal,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span> 
          [1] </span></a> or cris cheek’s and Kirsten Lavers’ collaborative presentation, 
          via lap-top projections, of accumulative interventions made out of “things 
          not worth keeping,”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> [2] 
          </span></a> by which they refer to solicited items deemed discardable 
          by their owners undergoing “value-transitions” via their being re-presented 
          in continually reconfigured public installations inviting responses from 
          viewers.  Certainly Carla Harryman’s new theatre production—<i>Performing 
          Objects Stationed in Platform on the Sub (Urban) World</i>—written especially 
          for the colloquium, became the very heart of it; situated in the evening 
          between the two days of papers and discussion, and played by a cast that 
          involved some of our presenters, it became key in conversation and is 
          discussed in our selection here at the end of Redell Olsen’s essay. <a href="#_edn3"
  name="_ednref3" title=""> [3] </a>   And finally, some talks were delivered extempore, 
          like Anthony Joseph’s opening one about his personal translation from 
          Caribbean to British life.  He spoke of having to envision exile as a 
          concept/experience “that becomes textual” in order to effect his own presence 
          (which depends on loss of its bearings) on the page as well as in performance.  
          This description of using fragmentary language to create his own “self-styled 
          vacuum”—his own peculiar and historical displacement in language being 
          understood as <i>space,</i> which encompasses both absence and location—provided 
          a provocative start to the colloquium, given its modeling of historical 
          and irreducible if involuted presence that remains unassimilated in more 
          familiar models of dispersed presence as we tend to assume them in avant-garde 
          poetics.  </font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          implicit problems in both that kind of theoretical disjuncture discernible 
          between talks at the colloquium <i>and </i>the very idea that raced, gendered 
          or sexual difference <i>might </i>be “assimilated” within broadening models 
          of performative presence are explored either tangentially or directly 
          in the pieces that I have chosen to assemble here for <i>HOW2</i>’s readers.  
          For example, though it may be less than immediately apparent upon listening 
          to them, there are provocative connections between Tyrus Miller’s and 
          Caroline Bergvall’s presentations, given their focus on the how the unassimilable—the 
          face, if you will, in that both discuss encounters with, or responses 
          to, images of it and the seen body—becomes key to the project of rereading 
          social meaning relationally.  What Bergvall calls the problem of “translatability” 
          in the “delay and the understanding of presence” is related to what Miller 
          describes, after the Hungarian film maker Péter Forgács, as the shift 
          from understanding film image as discrete fact to its articulation—precisely 
          <i>via</i> its inevitable loss of specific personal and historical reference—within 
          a configurational and gestural realm caught in the instant of filming.  
          We have here, as Bergvall has abbreviated it in her presentation notes, 
          an inevitable process of “[r]emoval of the face for its sign.”  These 
          home movies that Forgács collected from mid-century Central Europe and 
          now uses as his primary materials poignantly foreground the thickness 
          of presence: the operations of loss and mis-memorialization by which we 
          retrieve it, as we do as we look at these figures, and the partial aspect 
          (in every sense of that word) of its occurrence “against the backdrop 
          of historical events [it] can only partially comprehend.”   When he attempts, 
          as Miller argues Forgács has done in <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> (one 
          of the films made out of this footage), to “trace out relations in space 
          that are tangential to propositional language,” the “general problems 
          of relating the world as seen and said” enact a critique of the <i>Tractatus</i>—a 
          work Miller believes Forgács read as indirectly designed by the contradictions 
          of the everyday life of Central European Jewry at the time of the filming.  
          In other words, propositional language must be read back against the “presence” 
          of the inassimilable in order to be glimpsed as taking part in a configurational 
          complex of relations whose vanishing point by its very loss enables such 
          reading.</font><p></p>
       <p style='line-height:200%;'>  <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Such 
          matters, in addition to their reverse dynamic—what Bergvall calls up in 
          her notes via Judith Butler’s ideas from <i>Excitable Speech</i>:<i> </i>the 
          constitutive aspects of public language use—relate to Bergvall’s concerns 
          about “literacy” or the readability, translatability, of encountered difference 
          or otherness and the ethics of responding to it, of meeting “face to face.”  
          The partialness of the appearances of the face in her work-in-progress 
          performed/discussed at the colloquium, “About Face,”<a href="#_edn4"
  name="_ednref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a> as well as our retrieval of it 
          via operations that involve its displacement by recorded spoken fragments 
          and the assumptions they provoke about interlocutor and context, also 
          relate to the problems presented by Forgács’ film.  “Accidental finds 
          mean that personal detail is lost in broader recording/archiving context,” 
          she notes, commenting on Boltanski’s photographic installation, <i>Le 
          Lycée Chases</i>; “defacement, evacuation of personal history is replaced/emphasised 
          by approach to the viewer’s own processing” under the lights (gallery 
          lights, in this instance, or “interrogation lights”, as she calls them) 
          that signal those processes—because “[l]ight is always in the way.” Bergvall’s 
          invocation of N. Katherine Hayles’ work on the “posthuman,” and its description 
          of the constant interplay between inscription and incorporation, or abstract 
          systems of signs and instances of practice, leads her to muse for a moment 
          in her notes about the potential morphing of lost Benjaminian “aura” within 
          new articulations of presence—or, as she puts it, “in the performed aspect 
          of the viewing experience.  In the unique fragility of these found pics.”  
          Although referring here to Boltanski’s photographic work, Bergvall might 
          well have been thinking of <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> as well.  Forgács 
          like Boltanski seems to suggest with his treatment of found materials 
          that “art is always a witness,” that “form has become less important,” 
          and that “[n]ow we’re concerned with the right way of speaking to someone; 
          there is no form that is right forever…. Now [we] find it equally important 
          to work in the newspaper or with posters, say, to do work in the street 
          rather than to make pieces for museum display.”  The form Bergvall and 
          I chose for her text here—its “unfinished” state (as it was when delivered), 
          with its gestural economy and ellipses, its offering of work in progress 
          as communication requiring response (rather than “exhibited” artwork), 
          and its openness to interruption but insistence on continually renewing 
          the problem of response itself, signaled by the presence of her own face, 
          the “untranslatable individual, the socially opaque”—enacts her idea of 
          (the difficulty of) what performance does at the intersection of “the 
          gallery” and the public.  </font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          imperative to rethink the ethics of response, and therefore enact a presentness 
          in relation to others through or despite what Bergvall describes as our 
          “prostheticised voice” and practice of “ventriloquism of the live image” 
          (thinking of the recent work <i>Mouthpiece</i> by Krzysztof Wodiczko, 
          which investigates such social processes), informed several key papers 
          at the colloquium, if in very different ways and with markedly differing 
          results.  It was present in Robert Sheppard’s critical link-up of discourses 
          about performance and Levinas’s much-discussed distinctions between “saying” 
          and “the said”—the former embodying that present unfinishedness and “openness 
          to the other” that the latter cannot. Sheppard’s strategies for reading 
          such embodiments, or Levinas’s well-known meditations on the face (which 
          are not directly mentioned in his paper), differ in crucial ways from 
          Bergvall’s and take him in other directions in terms of commentary on 
          the politics of presence in performance—to which I will return below.  
          Joan Retallack, working from Gertrude Stein’s quasi-syllogistic suggestion 
          that “nothing is surprising but a coincidence, a fact is not surprising,” 
          [t]here is always a coincidence in crime,” and [t]here are so many ways 
          in which there is no crime”(<i>Blood On The Dining Room Floor</i>), also 
          addresses similar issues by considering the “liveness” of openness to 
          unpredictability, and the transgressive valence of presenting one to an(other) 
          in the site of “contiguity,” which she thinks of as “the spatial dimension 
          of coincidence.”  “It is in fact the ill-fitting coincidence-contiguity 
          of our reciprocal alterity whose energies continually disrupt longings 
          for harmony”—harmony that might be enacted within “the connection of connections 
          within a work of art” but not when read alongside “the connections between 
          persons and events and things in daily life.”  Reading this part of the 
          essay alongside Bergvall’s (related but not wholly similar) notes on the 
          bilingualism so key to her work, and the untranslatable “traffic” it generates, 
          is rewarding.  Retallack, commenting on the “incommensurability of the 
          multiple logics we experience and employ in different parts of our lives,” 
          also implicitly draws—as do Bergvall and Sheppard more explicitly—Bakhtin 
          back into the mix of key theorists whose ideas gave rise to certain kinds 
          of assumptions at the colloquium, though the latter were often articulated 
          with the difference that, in revision of Bakhtin’s more utopian dialogic 
          or polyphonic models, or models of “answerability,” new dynamic <i>space</i> 
          is given to the impermeable or unreadable (or silent): the radical contingencies 
          of presentness that escape reading within current literacies.</font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          problem or task of generating new literacies for, as Retallack puts it, 
          “the making of new intelligibility, that is, a new form of life…a swerve 
          of thought toward a use of history that enables a vital invention of self 
          in the reciprocal alterity of the contemporary moment,” was taken up by 
          both Alex Goody and Robert Sheppard primarily as a task for the reader 
          before the performative text.  Goody, whose reading of Susan Howe’s work 
          as being hypertextual in effect—i.e., as encouraging new forms of embodiment 
          and agency from readers who must themselves become performers—dovetails 
          interestingly with Sheppard’s in that both ultimately argue that “performance 
          may feel ontologically repressive,” as Sheppard puts it, “if the condition 
          of saying inherent in a text may only fully be realized by a reader in 
          dialogue with the text, unfolding its sounds in the variable temporalities 
          that reading and memory allow.”   In other words, the “saidness” of the 
          performative text can become the openness of saying when given what he 
          calls “successful reading.”  In relation to this, and along with John 
          Cayley and Redell Olsen, Goody argues that hypertextual modes only help 
          realize what many works in codex media demand formally, but which their 
          current state in page-bound “static”-ness obscures.  What I found interesting 
          about these various arguments was that they seemed to suggest that electronic 
          work <i>isn’t </i>(when I thought that some at the colloquium might argue 
          that it is) actually performance itself, though like codex text it can 
          be performative; at the same time, both exceed performance in terms of 
          empowering the viewer/reader and enabling <i>their </i>embodied reading.  
          Description of the “prior performer”—the planner of our options in hypertext, 
          the setter of links and pathways and sometimes temporal/temporalized movements, 
          the presentness of that limiting sensibility, the one we respond to even 
          as we seem to be “navigating” our own route through such texts—was elided 
          in the course of discussion of readerly choice-making.  Yet I kept wondering 
          how such conversation might be altered if, say, Fiona Templeton’s performance 
          of <i>You – The City</i>, as treated in Olsen’s paper, was the subject, 
          with its creation of what Olsen calls “alternative networks of communication” 
          in an urban setting.  Was <i>that </i>“performance” as it was being filmed 
          because other bodies besides those of the participants were involved?  
          Does the fact that participants had a limited number of options in terms 
          of following said “alternative” routes in the city mean that they weren’t 
          as empowered as readers are when sat before hypertextual manifestations 
          of texts?  Do the latter not also contain limited routes of possibility? 
          How <i>much</i> choice makes for “agency” in reader/viewer response?—was 
          a question I was left with; and is that agency dependent upon the <i>absence</i> 
          of another body participating in making the text?  The trace of the writing 
          subject is replaced as a concern for Goody by the materiality of the medium 
          in which [its] selected signs occur, as well as their context, inasmuch 
          as they relate entirely back to the <i>reader’s</i> experience/performance 
          of the text—“this means <i>x</i> for me here and now if I do this (turn 
          this page, read this section).”  “Within the context of hypertext,” she 
          argues, “the idea of ‘performance’ is radically redescribed as the text 
          itself if performed through the act of reading/using”.  But is there really 
          a redefinition at work here?  Mustn’t we see performative codex texts 
          as producing the same revelation? Is it not another <i>kind</i> of embodiment 
          that entails the use of commands and cursor to juxtapose or accumulate 
          given frames in new contiguities, or entails the silent performance and 
          temporalized juxtapositionings of what Sheppard calls (after Christopher 
          Middleton) the “vocal qualities,” or endophonic aspects of a text?  What 
          happens to the problem of response, of responding to the face—the embodied 
          presence—of the sayer when we talk about this kind of performance? Or 
          is it really not part of the same conversation?  And should it be?</font>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sheppard 
          includes in his discussion of Maggie O’Sullivan’s performance work a section 
          entitled “The Word Made Flesh,” by which he means the transformation of 
          material (language) into “signifying sound”—“when the body,” he writes, 
          quoting Bakhtin, “generating the sound from within itself and feeling 
          the unity of its own productive exertion, is drawn into form.”  He reads 
          O’Sullivan’s work as enfolding materiality into language by replicating 
          in the latter the processes of the natural world—“engendering mutant subjectivities,” 
          in Guattari’s terms, by launching “a forward flight into machinations 
          and deterritorialized machinic paths” with her sped-up evolutions of meaning 
          making. Suggesting that this is “the most poignant example of a saying 
          that pre-empts the power of the said,” Sheppard goes on to sound like 
          Retallack in his use of Guattari’s reformulations of Bakhtin in order 
          to think of such sayings—“articulated through the living body of the poet…in 
          the dialect become sociolect of performance”—as “refrains” which catalyze 
          decompositions of cultural redundancies by ordering chaos with link-ups 
          of disparate logic worlds.  Sheppard is, like Bergvall, keen to think 
          of how such performances intervene in developing “sociolects,” as he calls 
          them—discursive realms of possibility made in and for public use.  But 
          he must ultimately go with the Middletonian suggestion that the isolated 
          reading, made privately, is more effective: that “the inner ear is capable 
          of an auditory complexity which exceeds almost any audible vocalizing,” 
          and that poetry’s “saying” “may be more fully present in the kinds of 
          endophonic reading…during which the visual and the aural, the performative 
          and the semantic, work together in the reader-controlled temporality of 
          reception.”  I think this kind of differing conclusion might be due to 
          the way that embodiment is constructed in the reading of performance.  
          Between Bakhtinian notions of the “concrete unity” of word and poet in 
          the act of sounding, and Guattarian (neo-Adorno-esque) notions of the 
          “existential detachment” and “autonomy” required in the engendering of 
          refrain functions, there is little room for dialogue—for anything but 
          the closure of embodied performance upon itself, the “internal coherence” 
          Bergvall notes is possible via Bakhtin for her “Doll.”  Bakhtin was, after 
          all, in his early discussions of poetic embodiments, describing poetry 
          as the “monologic genre” for these very reasons.  And Guattari’s understanding 
          of the detachment of fragments from content in the course of “autopoesis” 
          risks the same sort of problems Bergvall and Retallack note for the “artwork” 
          that would substitute the “connection of connections” within itself for 
          connection to (and creation of self through) the other, for what Bakhtin 
          called “answerability” in novelized genres—and for what Boltanski means 
          by “the right way of speaking to someone.”   For embodiment that is, in 
          other words, communicative and accumulative of response.</font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          would seem, then, that at the colloquium we were discussing a number of 
          differing kinds of embodiments/presence in a number of differing kinds 
          of performance.  It might therefore be most provocative to end with reference 
          to Redell Olsen’s paper on “Degrees of Liveness” which she pursued by 
          thinking through operations performed in works by Leslie Scalapino, Fiona 
          Templeton and Carla Harryman.  Olsen’s Auslanderesque<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> 
          [5] </span></a> premises concerning “event as representation” in our increasingly 
          mediatized culture problematize any easy definition of presence as immediacy 
          of bodily location/responsiveness in space and time.  This problem is 
          bound up with what Bergvall struggles with in her notation about the inseparability 
          of inscription and incorporation (from <i>corpus</i>, <i>incorporare</i>, 
          to put into the body of something else), as Hayles describes it; the question 
          for Bergvall becomes: “Is this assimilable to [Peggy] Phelan’s articulation 
          of the live occurrence as unrepeatable? (no)”.  If there can never be 
          prioritization of full presencing—“the live subject’s ‘I saw this’ [being 
          anything other than] a tissue of varying degress of liveness that have 
          occurred over a period of time”—then degrees of liveness for Olsen become 
          traceable in the subject’s self-reflexivity and alternative path-taking 
          as she describes it in Scalapino’s revelation of the mediatized manipulation 
          of witnessing in <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> (made after the L.A. riots) and in 
          Templeton’s remapping of urban connections in <i>You – The City</i>.  
          As with Goody, Olsen’s focus in much of her paper is on “the reader becom[ing] 
          self-consciously aware of her relationship to the reading of the text 
          itself”; therefore, when discussing Harryman’s electronic collaboration 
          with the artist Amy Trachtenberg, <i>The Games </i>(<a
  href="http://www.markszine.com/">http://www.markszine.com</a>), for example, she 
          writes that the process of activating its icons “creates a space for a 
          reader whose degree of liveness is figured by a recognition of the radical 
          possibility of the subjunctive: <i>what if I were to click here…what if 
          I might…would it make a difference if I</i>…”.</font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          yet, as with Goody, Olsen’s assumption that “the text performs its own 
          reflexivity, which effectively displaces the distinction between outside 
          and inside onto the event itself” might also be seen to blur the problem 
          of the specification of location—proximity, relationality, etc.—vis-à-vis 
          the performing presence.  It does so partly by supposing an “outside” 
          that encompasses amorphousness, or all the world in its operations, versus 
          an “inside” equally dislocated from situating relations; Templeton’s work 
          set in the city consequently provides such “radical possibility of the 
          subjunctive” because it “lack[s] a frame,” “is not bracketed from the 
          world by use of conventional theatre space,” and therefore allows more 
          chance combining into its mix—but its ranges of possible choice-making 
          are certainly discernible as well.  Readers will find it interesting to 
          compare Olsen’s discussion of framing with Retallack’s; the latter suggests 
          that performance is itself defined by frames, that “it could not be coterminous 
          with everyday-life time, since the framing of an event as performance 
          is in fact a kind of time-bracketing (as Cage called it) that transforms 
          the time-sense (as Stein called it) within it.”  Perhaps Retallack and 
          Olsen meet in understanding liveness through degrees of response to the 
          “foregrounded contingencies” in performance—the difference being that 
          Retallack understands the latter to be readymade as well, “fram[es or] 
          location for the construction of a process of cultural play.”</font><p></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          any case, Olsen’s description of Templeton’s use of “readymades” develops 
          into a method of reading performative presence in relation to designated 
          props that allows her to beautifully illuminate Harryman’s theatre “objects/actors” 
          in <i>Performing Objects</i>, as well as their function on stage.  “Like 
          narrative, ‘character’ in Harryman’s work is distributed across points,” 
          Olsen writes, “points that include animate and inanimate objects.”  As 
          in Bergvall’s work, presence in Harryman’s is often both situated and 
          accumulative, responsive to local architectures of physical space and 
          inter-personal relationships.  Her home town of Detroit informs <i>Performing 
          Objects</i>, becoming physicalized in Beckettian fashion in the few props 
          required, like the car wheel, as well as in the dynamics of its peculiar 
          urban center now decentered and grown into detached shapes of communities.  
          She “present[s] bodies,” Olsen writes, “as she does narrative but redistributed.  
          The performing objects are always in excess or at an angle to that which 
          could be considered a bounded subject position and in this sense the live 
          subject on the stage multiplies itself, refracts and visually exceeds 
          the sum total of named parts.”  Such refraction of named characters into 
          parts like “C2a” and C2b,” for example, often reflects discursive versus 
          active engagement in the desirous and sometimes violent imaginings and 
          actions that constitute the play’s “narrative.”  Presence is “figured,” 
          in the production, as being in that space of contiguity between what Retallack 
          in her paper names “figs.,” or real objects/people-cum-representations, 
          and metaphorical/structural imaginings; it depends, in other words, on 
          reading structuring relations with an eye/ear for the gaps—what Retallack 
          calls the “<i>contingent but not arbitrary</i>…condition of life principles 
          that have to do with complex interactions and impermeabilities that constitute 
          any event in the world.”  The emotive quality of the piece, like and unlike 
          Beckett’s in its refusal of character but insistence on performing presence, 
          made it the perfect work to accompany our colloquium’s headier discussion 
          of the same.</font><p></p>

            where, quite controversially, dead babies’ body parts were used in further 
            operations without the express permission of parents or relatives.  
            Patience Agbabi, situated for one year in a residency shared between 
            the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Poetry and the School for Heath 
            Care at Oxford Brookes University, solicited responses from people involved 
            in the incident or who were observers of it for the purpose of making 
            a community poem, a collage work, out of the offered materials.  Interestingly, 
            a letter of objection to this project was posted on the Brookes e-mail 
            network; its argument that such materials would be inevitably recast 
            and “used” by the narrating voice of the poem made performance of it 
            at the colloquium especially complicated for Agbabi, and intriguing
