  style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          review the connections between Mina Loy and Ezra Pound should be a relatively 
          straightforward matter. There is, after all, no shortage of biographical 
          material on Pound, and we now have Carolyn Burke’s <i>Becoming Modern</i>, 
          as well as the essays brought together in <i>Mina Loy: Woman and Poet</i>.<a href="#note1"> 
          1</a> Yet, <a name="back1"></a>while Pound’s reading of Loy and his support 
          for her work have received a fair amount of comment, the available biographical 
          studies of the two poets tell us surprisingly little about their meetings 
          and intellectual exchanges. Of course, Loy hardly seemed a significant 
          player when Norman and Stock wrote their early books on Pound, but it 
          is slightly surprising to find no mention of her in Humphrey Carpenter’s 
          more recent work (and Carpenter certainly has a developed interest in 
          Pound’s relations with women, particularly in the early stages of the 
          poet’s career). <a href="#note2">2</a> What<a name="back2"></a> is even 
          more striking is the absence of any hard information about their meetings 
          in Paris in the early twenties in Carolyn Burke’s <i>Becoming Modern</i>, 
          especially as she reproduces two photographs of them together (Burke is 
          equally unforthcoming about Loy’s encounters with Wyndham Lewis in Paris 
          and London—tantalising indeed <a href="#note3">3</a>). <a name="back3"></a>One 
          can actually glean very little: we know, for example, from Virgil Thomson’s 
          autobiography (but not from Burke) that Loy attended the Parisian première 
          of Pound’s opera, <i>The Testament of Villon</i>, in 1926, and she must 
          have heard other arrangements by him because she notes in the recently 
          recovered essay of 1925, “Modern Poetry,” that “his music was played in 
          Paris,” <a href="#note4">4</a> but of t<a name="back4"></a>he conversations 
          they must have had only one intriguing trace seems to remain: in a 1943 
          interview, Loy recalled that “Pound was like a child, and an old professor 
          at the same time. His craze then was endocrine glands. He would talk about 
          it a great deal—very learned discussion. Glands…were the latest thing 
          at the time.” Just how illuminating Loy found this it’s impossible to 
          know, but it’s likely that Pound’s often hectoring manner did not appeal. 
          Loy went on: “He was a sensitive man who didn’t think other people were 
          sensitive. One of his friends said he had brought from America the faults 
          of America, and none of the virtues.”<a href="#note5"> 5</a> <a name="back5"></a>(Williams 
          Carlos Williams is the likely source of that last remark.)</font></span></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>There is surprisingly little to go on, then, apart from 
          Pound’s isolated comments on Loy which are, with the exception of the 
          1918 <i>Little Review</i> piece on the <i>Others </i>anthology, usually 
          brief, but insistent that Loy be considered part of the American vanguard. 
          The 1918 account of Loy and Moore is well-known, for it was there that 
          Pound first produced his account of “logopoeia,” “a dance of the intelligence 
          among words and ideas and modification of ideas and characters” (in the 
          1929 “How to Read” the formulation would be slightly modified to “the 
          dance of the intellect,” now the most familiar version). <a href="#note6">6</a> 
          Pound <a name="back6"></a>famously aligned the “arid clarity” he discerned 
          in Loy and Moore with a specifically American modernism. Several months 
          later, in a review section for the magazine <i>Future</i>, he wrote of 
          the <i>Others</i> anthology again, this time quoting passages from Loy’s 
          “Effectual Marriage” (misremembering—perhaps deliberately?—its title as 
          “Ineffectual Marriage”) and observing that “Laforgue’s influence or some 
          kindred tendency is present in the whimsicalities of Marianne Moore, and 
          of Mina Loy.” <a href="#note7">7</a> Beyond<a name="back7"></a> this, 
          we have sporadic comments in letters to the editor of the <i>Little Review</i>, 
          Margaret Anderson, which tell us little more than that Pound wanted to 
          retain Loy as a regular contributor, and several remarks in letters to 
          Williams and Moore which argue more forcefully for her prominence in the 
          American literary scene (“is there anyone in America,” he writes to Moore, 
          “except you, Bill and Mina Loy who can write anything of interest in verse?” 
          <a href="#note8">8</a>).<a name="back8"></a> Pound, of course, spent parts 
          of 1924 in Italy and settled permanently in Rapallo the following year, 
          thus removing himself from the round of dinners and parties which Loy 
          attended and which Williams enjoyed during his visit to Paris during Pound’s 
          absence in 1924. <a href="#note9">9</a> With <a name="back9"></a>his attention 
          shifting increasingly to political and economic matters, it is thus surprising 
          to find Pound suddenly returning to Loy’s work as late as 1933. The occasion 
          was an open letter from Marinetti to Pound, published in <i>Il Mare</i>, 
          the Rapallo paper to which Pound was a frequent contributor during the 
          early thirties. While addressing Pound in a friendly spirit, Marinetti 
          drew a distinction between what he called masculine/heroic and feminine/pessimistic 
          types of writing, noting that some of the writers Pound had been publishing 
          in <i>Il Mare</i> unfortunately represented the second tendency. The criticism 
          was enough to prompt Pound to write a long piece in which he paid tribute 
          to the women writers of his generation. Noting first that “the most valuable 
          part of Anglo-American literature in my half-century has been nursed, 
          nourished, and supported in reviews edited by WOMEN,” he went on to affirm 
          the importance of three writers: Mary Butts, Kay Boyle, and Mina Loy. 
          His comment on Loy is as follows: “MINA LOY holds her position in Anglo-American 
          poetry of my decade, perhaps the most spontaneous, perhaps the most original, 
          a bit absent-minded, who sometimes succeeded and sometimes didn’t. It 
          would take an entire article for an adequate discussion.” <a href="#note10">10</a> 
          Whether<a name="back10"></a> or not Pound was trying to needle Marinetti 
          by praising the futurist’s ex-lover, his comment at this remove in time 
          suggests that Loy’s work had made a deep and lasting impression on him. 
          Indeed, he had recently returned to the poem he called “Ineffectual Marriage,” 
          including it in his 1932 anthology <i>Profile</i>, a work he described 
          as “a collection of poems which have stuck in my memory and which may 
          possibly define their epoch.” <a href="#note11">11</a></span> <a name="back11"></a> 
          </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>These fragmentary comments raise the interesting possibility 
          that, the paternalistic tone of the <i>Little Review</i> piece notwithstanding, 
          Pound’s discovery of Loy was actually in some way pivotal to the development 
          of his own work. Most critics, of course, have tended to read the influence 
          the other way, drawing comparisons between “Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose”(1923) 
          and the earlier <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i>(1920), <a href="#note12">12</a> 
          <a name="back12"></a> but Carolyn Burke for one has suggested that the 
          example of “logopoeia” in Loy’s work allowed him to develop “a critical 
          theory that could justify and explain” his recently published <i>Homage 
          to Sextus Propertius</i>. <a href="#note13">13</a> <a name="back13"></a>As 
          far as  I know, though, only Reno Odlin in a brief aside in his review 
          of <i>The Last Lunar Baedeker</i> has gone so far as to propose that the 
          <i>style</i> of <i>Mauberley</i> was somehow directly affected by Pound’s 
          reading of Loy: “it must now be plain to everyone where he got the cadences 
          which come off so beautifully toward the end of <i>Mauberley</i>,” says 
          Odlin. <a href="#note14">14</a> The <a name="back14"></a>observation is 
          not developed, but it has confirmed my growing sense of a kind of reciprocal 
          influence at work across these texts of Pound and Loy. Certainly, Pound 
          had been following <i>Others</i> magazine before his <i>Little Review</i> 
          piece on Loy and Moore (he was an active contributor) and he would have 
          read <i>Songs to Joannes</i> there. <a href="#note15">15</a> And<a name="back15"></a> 
          while it remains difficult to specify the extent to which Loy and the 
          poets of <i>Others</i> impelled him in a new direction, the publication 
          of “Moeurs contemporaines” in 1918 made it clear that Pound was trying 
          to supplement the often coy refinements of his imagist verse with a lighter, 
          more ironic <i>vers de société</i>. <a href="#note16">16</a> But<a name="back16"></a> 
          the anecdotal observations of “Moeurs contemporaines”<i> </i>rarely approached 
          the complex and impacted verbal forms of Loy’s <i>Songs</i>, and it was 
          not until <i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i> that Pound was really able to approximate 
          the “logopoeic” handling of abstract vocabulary that already made Loy’s 
          satirical style so distinctive. Part of the section from “Effectual Marriage” 
          that Pound reproduced in his review for <i>Future</i> seems, in fact, 
          to ghost the cadence and verbal play of <i>Mauberley:</i></span> </font>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Loy’s use of abstract words like “incipience,” “correlative” 
          and the soon-to-be-Poundian “instigation” mimes the shift from “palpable” 
          to “transcendent” which for Miovanni/Papini is the ultimate test of Gina/Mina’s 
          usefulness. The “fantasy” is Papini’s, though it is ironically undercut 
          as an expression of male privilege by the fact that this is Mina’s vocabulary 
          not his. He may like her softness and pliability, but the pseudo-scientific 
          word “mollescent” reserves to itself the force of ultimately superior 
          judgement, its analytic clarity providing the necessary “irritant” to 
          this lamely conventional male fantasy. Pound has been criticised for his 
          view that Loy’s work displays “no emotion whatever” and that it demonstrates 
          an “arid clarity,” but in one sense that might seem a valid response to 
          a language which gains its power from its sheer externality or from what 
          Lewis would term the “external method” of satire. <a href="#note17">17</a> 
          C<a name="back17"></a>ompare Pound’s epitaph for Mauberley:</span></font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The cadence and phrasing definitely recall Loy’s “Being 
          an incipience…,” and Pound’s latinate vocabulary (“disjunct,” “intermittences”) 
          similarly catches the lazy fantasising of Mauberley even as it coldly 
          holds the persona at arm’s length. If Loy’s “Effectual Marriage” was particularly 
          important to Pound (and it was the one poem of hers that he cited repeatedly) 
          it was partly because, as he put it in the <i>Little Review</i> piece, 
          “It has none of the stupidity beloved of the ‘lyric’ enthusiast and the 
          writer and reader who take refuge in scenery description of nature, because 
          they are unable to cope with the human.” <a href="#note19">19</a> The 
          i<a name="back19"></a>dea of “cop[ing] with the human” already expresses 
          a Lewisian contempt for the purely “natural.” “Art,” says Lewis memorably, 
          “consists…in a <i>mechanising</i> of the natural,” <a href="#note20">20</a> 
          and<a name="back20"></a> the cadence and idiom that Pound develops from 
          Loy offer a way of subordinating psychology to aesthetic form, with this 
          vocabulary, ostensibly so inappropriate to lyric, conducting its own implicit 
          critique of romantic fantasy. </span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>For it is precisely that fantasy that apparently destroys 
          the “artist’s urge” in the second part of Pound’s poem and accounts for 
          the hedonistic “drifting” memorialised in Mauberley’s epitaph. Hence the 
          coldly “aesthetic” presentation of the soprano in the final poem, “Medallion,” 
          a part of the sequence which has caused much disagreement, with critics 
          still tending to read it as an evocation of artistic impoverishment. <a href="#note21">21</a> 
          Yet<a name="back21"></a> there is a crucial intertext for this poem, a 
          review by Pound of a performance given by the soprano Raymonde Collignon 
          on whom the singer in “Medallion” is generally thought to be modelled. 
          Part of the review is as follows:</span> </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>No one has a more keen perception than she has of the 
            difference between art and life; of the necessary scale and proportion 
            required in the presentation of a thing which is not the photograph 
            and wax-cast, but <i>a re-creation in different and proportional medium</i>. 
            As long as this diseuse was on stage she was non-human; she was, if 
            you like, a china image…<a href="#note22">22</a><a name="back22"></a></span></font></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>So whether we like it or not (and most critics have not), 
          Pound does seem to have intended the sequence to end on a high note, with 
          the confusing immediacy of the passion which sets Mauberley drifting, 
          temporarily overcome by making the experience of desire one which is thoroughly<i> 
          mediated </i>by previous cultural contexts—a move which interestingly 
          inverts Loy’s concluding snub to Love as “the preeminent littérateur” 
          in <i>Songs to Joannes</i>. In “Medallion,” the woman becomes an object 
          of desire only in so far as she is cast in a “different medium” and thereby 
          rendered “non-human” and thoroughly aesthetic. In repudiating any confusion 
          of what Pound elsewhere calls the “caressable” with artistic values, <a href="#note24">24</a> 
          he<a name="back24"></a> here deviates quite deliberately from the usual 
          idiom of passionate celebration—it is, for example, <i>the, </i>not her, 
          “sleek head” which emerges from the frock, and in the typescript Pound 
          had originally used the very un-erotic “pate” instead of “head,” the eventual 
          deletion showing, perhaps, that he was unwilling to go as far as Loy in 
          demystifying the romantic body. <a href="#note25">25</a> <a name="back25"></a></span></font></p>

          the sense of an acknowledged relation between the two is strengthened 
          when we hear that Pound apparently admired <i>Anglo-Mongrels</i> as an

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The partial and momentary intersection of these works 
          by two essentially very different poets may tell us something useful about 
          divergent strands within this period of Anglo-American modernism. For 
          Pound’s review of Loy’s work occurred at a particularly rich moment in 
          the evolution of his poetics, a moment (1918) in which he was also exploring 
          “the prose tradition in verse” through the writings of Flaubert, James, 
          Lewis and Joyce, and coordinating these with an intensive reading of Laforgue 
          initially inspired by Eliot’s enthusiasm for the French poet. <a href="#note31">31</a> 
          It is<a name="back31"></a> Laforgue, of course, about whose irony Pound 
          had written an important essay the year before, who provides the context 
          in which he reads Loy and Moore. In that essay of 1917, “Irony, Laforgue, 
          and Some Satire,” Pound had praised Laforgue for his command of what he 
          called a “good verbalism” (“Bad verbalism,” he says, “is rhetoric, or 
          the use of <i>cliché</i> unconsciously, or a mere playing with phrases” 
          <a href="#note32">32</a>). <a name="back32"></a> Pound emphasises that 
          this is not “the popular language of any country but an international 
          tongue common to the excessively cultivated,” and it is that internationalism 
          which Pound specifies in the idioms of Loy and Moore as a “distinctly 
          <i>national</i> product,” the paradox affirming the exorbitantly polyglot 
          nature of the American language. All these concerns centering on satire 
          and “verbalism” are focussed in what Pound sees as Laforgue’s <i>modernisation</i> 
          of poetic style, and I want to look at this in more detail since it provides 
          the key to Pound's interest in Loy and also explains why, after <i>Mauberley</i>, 
          his own work would move in a very different direction from hers. Certainly, 
          the “modern” qualities of Laforgue’s poetry are clear enough: there is 
          his exploration of free verse and his fascination with types of “social” 
          subject matter; there is the daringly hybrid and neologistic vocabulary, 
          and the often risqué management of familiar romantic themes (Laforgue 
          is said to be the first French poet to use the word “clitoris” in verse). 
          Above all, there is, as Pound notes in his 1917 essay, the “delicate irony” 
          and the intellectual cast of the writing: “The ironist,” observes Pound, 
          “is one who suggests that the reader should think.”(281) Yet with its 
          appeal to the “excessively cultivated,” Laforgue’s work is also very much 
          of its time, the time of decadence. Pound notes in passing that Beardsley’s 
          <i>Under the Hill</i> was “until recently the only successful attempt 
          to produce ‘anything like Laforgue’ in our tongue,”(283) but he doesn’t 
          pursue the question far, moving instead to a discussion of satire. The 
          more we look at Pound’s account, though, the more we may be struck by 
          its partiality. It is, above all, Laforgue as “purge and critic” that 
          Pound wants to stress, and accordingly we don’t hear very much at all 
          about the poet’s darker side, about his “Buddhistic sense of fatality,” 
          <a href="#note33">33</a> his<a name="back33"></a> preoccupation with solitude 
          and with moments of psychic fragility, his Schopenhaurian view of the 
          will, and his quite un-Poundian pursuit of self-mortification. Laforgue’s 
          “nonchalance of manner,” as Pound terms it, actually represents only one 
          aspect of his work, certainly masking the mordant and macabre features 
          of his irony to which Eliot was predictably drawn.</span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>To this we can add that the decadent and the modern are, 
          in fact, more closely interwoven than Pound would have us believe, <a href="#note34">34</a> 
          though <a name="back34"></a>Laforgue, he does admit, is “exquisite,” another 
          indication that the “hardness” for which he is to be admired is not quite 
          yet the “hardness” of modernist style. Indeed, the dazzling coinages which 
          feature so prominently in Laforgue’s work are closely allied to the decadent 
          cult of the “rare” word, which, drawing on Mallarmé, sought to create 
          the effect of a language partially dead and not in any practical sense 
          for use (we can find more obviously decadent forms of it in, say, the 
          work of  Stefan George and Walter Pater). In fact, the “verbalism” for 
          which Pound praised Laforgue might suggest something not so very different 
          from the allegedly “false” autonomy of the decadent style which always 
          threatens to substitute a purely artificial language for a social one 
          (the <i>OED</i> defines “verbalism” as ‘the predominance of what is merely 
          verbal over reality or real significance”). What is of particular interest 
          about this question is that it points up a major ambivalence within Anglo-American 
          modernism, an ambivalence which turns on the relation of the modern to 
          the decadent, and which is focused on exactly this issue of linguistic 
          self-sufficiency and verbal “materiality.” This strand of modernism derives 
          much of its power from such ambivalence: on the one hand there is the 
          turn to a “writerly” language (in Roland Barthes’s sense of the term), 
          while on the other there is an insistence on the need for modes of objectification, 
          for the “welding of word and thing” of which Pound spoke so forcefully. 
          <a href="#note35">35</a></span> <a name="back35"></a> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>If it’s not always easy, then, to see precisely what 
          Pound took from Laforgue it’s partly because he seems to have seized on 
          the poet’s irony as a sort of mediating term between these two ways of 
          writing. Irony offers the necessary escape from sentimentality and romantic 
          expressivism, providing a strategic means by which to affirm the self 
          as strong and authoritative—“modern” as opposed to “decadent” in Pound’s 
          scheme of things. Of course Pound himself would never actually be much 
          of an ironist, lacking both the delicate touch of Laforguian humour and 
          the poet’s related fascination with the minutiae of social behaviour. 
          Instead, Pound came to associate the satirical aspect of Laforgue’s verse 
          with the key terms of his own modernism—“image,” “form,” “energy,” “objectivity”—all 
          terms whose technical application also implies the agonistic relation 
          the avant-garde would assume toward its subject matter and audience. “Form” 
          must be seen to be won through what Pound, in a discussion of Lewis’s 
          painting, calls the “combat of arrangement”(GB, 121), a combat only marginally 
          less dramatic than his description elsewhere of the artist as “the phallus 
          or spermatozoide charging, head-on, the female chaos.” The connection 
          exceeds simple analogy, reminding us that this privileging of intellect 
          above emotion, along with its related activities of “seeing” and “knowing,” 
          leads not to forms of rigorous <i>self</i>-scrutiny but rather to an often 
          aggressive objectification of the other. To which we can add that the 
          “inorganic” style of decadent writing is not so much jettisoned as reworked 
          so as to produce an ideal of psychic authority and coherence where the 
          fin-de-siècle writers had discerned the instability and, sometimes, the 
          very extinction of the self.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>What is especially interesting about Pound’s construction 
          of a Laforguian modernism and his way of using this as a lens through 
          which to read Loy’s work is precisely its programmatic partiality. Yet 
          while the values of surface and “hardness” so crucial to his avant-garde 
          polemics of 1918 would certainly shape the ostensible technical protocols 
          of <i>The Cantos</i>, Pound would actually never lose his parallel attraction 
          to the “softer” Swinburnian poetics which were to characterise many of 
          the visionary sequences of the poem, early and late. Indeed, Laforgue 
          makes an appearance in the very last “full” Canto Pound ever wrote, Canto 
          116, where we read:</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>This late revisiting of Laforgue suggests another dimension 
          of the French poet’s work, reminding us again that a strand of decadent 
          style runs through <i>The Cantos</i>, with the specially heightened lyric 
          mode drawing attention to verbal and phonic values in a way which the

          Pound had cut from his 1918 translation of <i>Salomé </i>but to which

          its own sake, in the rich “opacity” of words, to use Laforgue’s own term. 
          In becoming “opaque” in this way, language provides the poet with a luxurious 
          freedom, a freedom from the obsessive self-consciousness which characterised 
          Laforgue's genius but which he also felt as a constant affliction. So 
          “the ideal things,” he observed in another account of the Berlin aquarium,

          water had flowed under the bridge. The experience of profound mental and 
          physical debility which Pound underwent during his years at St Elizabeth’s 
          arguably made him more responsive to several new things in Laforgue’s 
          writing. In the closed regions of the aquarium’s dreamlike, subaquatic 
          world, words no longer had to cleave to things but could be relished for 
          themselves; and furthermore, Pound might have been led to notice that 
          Laforguian word-play wasn’t just a matter of active social satire—it was 
          also intensely reflexive and internalised, a matter of intricate cross-reference 
          and echo, stylistic qualities which would come very much to the fore in 
          late Cantos such as 110. <a href="#note41">41</a><a name="back41"></a></span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have sketched these two Laforguian moments in Pound’s 
          thinking in a very abbreviated way, but I hope it is clear that neither 
          of them fully defines Loy’s particular brand of logopoeia. While her “verbalism” 
          seems closer in kind to the materiality of the second type, with an emphasis 
          on internal play rather than on Poundian “objectification,” it also departs 
          from the quasi-symbolist reflexivity we might discern in some of the late 
          Cantos.  We can best understand this difference by looking more closely 
          at Loy’s recently recovered essay on “Modern Poetry,”<a name="back42"></a> 
          <a href="#note42">42</a> where, as some critics have noted, the American 
          language is characterised as a “composite language,” a “welter of unclassifiable 
          speech,”(159) “English enriched and variegated with the grammatical structure 
          and voice-inflection of many races.”(158) <a href="#note43">43</a> In 
          v<a name="back43"></a>iew of this “novel alloy” (the word-play seems deliberate), 
          “It was inevitable,” says Loy, “that the renaissance of poetry should 
          proceed out of America, where latterly a thousand languages have been 
          born.”(158) What has not so far been noted about this essay is that it 
          seems deliberately to allude to the terms of Pound’s 1918 review of her 
          work. Not only does Loy celebrate at the outset Pound’s “magnificent Cantos” 
          and his role as “the masterly impressario of modern poets”(158), but she 
          also follows him in elaborating the paradox of a national language as 
          a polyglot one and in arguing that this is the true idiom of modernity. 
          The Laforguian idea of verbal coinage is prominent, too, for, as she puts 
          it, “Every moment [the true American] ingeniously coins new words for 
          old ideas.”(159) Even more intriguing, though, is the following passage: 
          “The variety and felicity of these structural movements in modern verse 
          has more than vindicated the rebellion against tradition. It will be found 
          that one can recognize each of the modern poets’ work by the gait of their 
          mentality.”(157) It is hard not to feel that this last phrase—“the gait 
          of their mentality”—is a calculated reformulation of Pound’s “dance of 
          the intelligence.” If it is, it’s a telling one, with Loy substituting 
          for the stylish symbolist dance the more deliberately mundane figure of 
          walking (a “gait” is also something a horse has). It is not necessary 
          to retrace here the historical progress of the partially disembodied dancer, 
          from Mallarmé through Yeats, to Stevens, to signal the emphatic embodiment 
          conveyed in this one word when read against its Poundian precursor. This 
          “mentality” takes pleasure in its pedestrian encounter with words whose 
          ungainliness and imperfection incite new rhythms and cadences which root 
          them in a human world with all <i>its</i> acknowledged grubbiness and 
          rough edges. We are already far from the “non-human” soprano figured in 
          Pound’s “Medallion,” and we can also note that where Pound’s “logopoeic” 
          words are rooted in a traditional if abstract lexicon, Loy’s move between, 
          on the one hand, the recondite and archaic (“elusion, “aniline,” etc.), 
          and deliberate if recognisable coinages, like “changeant” and “eclosion,” 
          “inideate” and “stoppled.” On a number of occasions, a word can also simply 
          be “wrong”—“insuccess,” for example. This, then, is the “foreign language” 
          she told Julien Levy she was trying to make, <a href="#note44">44</a> 
          a<a name="back44"></a>nd “foreign” not just in its repudiation of the 
          normative and familiar, but also because it is the alienating language 
          of satire, a medium which Lewis was currently reconstituting as one in 
          which the intellect derives its power from a head-on confrontation with 
          the grotesqueries of the “wild body.” This is something very different 
          from the epigrammatic wit of <i>Mauberley</i> and its final celebration 
          of the “non-human,” reminding us that Loy’s “Pig Cupid” also finds his 
          home in the messy materiality of the garbage heap. In that sense her vision 
          is finally closer to Lewis’s world of big babies and overheated German 
          frauleins than it is to Pound’s celebration of “Luini in porcelain.” Satire, 
          in this sense, renews its connection to the tradition of the grotesque 
          as Bakhtin describes it in his study of Rabelais:</span> </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>…the artistic logic of the grotesque image ignores the 
            closed, smooth, and impenetrable surface of the body and retains only 
            its excrescences (sprouts, buds) and orifices, only that which leads 
            beyond the body’s limited space or into the body’s depths….If we consider 
            the grotesque image in its extreme aspect, it never presents an individual 
            body; the image consists of orifices and convexities that present another, 
            newly conceived body. It is a point of transition in a life eternally 
            renewed, the inexhaustible vessel of death and conception. <a href="#note45">45</a><a name="back45"></a></span></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The contemporary scandal of Loy’s work was due, I think, 
          as much to its outrageous invocation of this tradition as it was to her 
          outspoken feminism and her public role as a “new woman” (the two were 
          in fact, of course, closely linked). As a result, Loy’s logopoeia was 
          a notably hybrid one, turning Pound’s elegant symbolist conception upside 
          down and showing the “logos” of “logopoeia” to be embedded in the very 
          body it was supposed to rise above. The ‘verbalism’ of phrases like the 
          “sub-umbilical mystery/of his husbandry” and the “impenetrable pink curtain” 
          <a href="#note46">46</a> her<a name="back46"></a>e made partial obscurity 
          a means at once of evading censorship <i>and </i>of being almost gratuitously 
          specific, with linguistic density being simultaneously the measure of 
          the unseen <i>and</i>, obliquely, the embodiment of what convention seeks 
          to hide. There was a humour here to which Pound, with his rather Pre-Raphaelite 
          notion of sexual passion, was not particularly well-attuned and which 
          can be missed even by contemporary commentators like Carolyn Burke who 
          seem keen to emphasise depressive tendencies at work in Loy’s writing. 
          As the connection with Pound shows, however, it was precisely Loy’s achievement 
          to push “logopoeia” to a boisterous extreme, where even the ironist’s 
          pretensions to aloof superiority would ultimately fall victim to the “humid 
          carnage” of the bodily life. <a href="#note47">47</a><a name="back47"></a></span></font></p>

          and…his new willingness to entertain previously threatening and unexplored 
          states of mind.”(184) Hamilton notes that “Pound’s regard for Laforgue’s 
          Buddhist passivity [is] gradually modified”(183) and that a certain reflexivity 
          in some of the late Cantos reconnects Pound to the Symbolist (Mallarméan) 
          tradition. [<a href="#back39">back to text</a>]</span> </font>
