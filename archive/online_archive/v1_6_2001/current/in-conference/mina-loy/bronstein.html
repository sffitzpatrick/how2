          at the edges. It contains an account of the moment in which the narrator

          hesitating, interrupted—nature of Mina Loy’s work, much of which was undated 
          and exists in various versions, having been subject to successive revisions, 
          and rendering a reliable chronology of unpublished writing almost impossible. 
          Moreover, autobiography and fiction blur, as she tells and retells her 
          story by means of self-mocking inventions and re-inventions of the self. 
          Not only was she Mina Lowy, Mina Loy, Ducie or Dusie Haweis, Mrs. Arthur 
          Cravan or Mina Lloyd to those who knew her, but she playfully employed 
          a variety of pseudonyms as poet and as autobiographical subject, including 
          Muna Lee, Imna Oly, Sophia, Jemima, Ova and Goy Israels.</span></font></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The elusiveness of her opus is replicated in the history 
          of its publication. The earliest poems to appear in print were those published 
          by the New York small presses, when Loy posted handwritten drafts from 
          Florence to Carl Van Vechten. At this distance, it was impossible to avoid 
          editorial and typesetting errors. For example, in an undated letter thanking 
          Van Vechten for his article in <i>Rogue</i> (August 1915), she asks, “By 
          the way who is the hero who taps my spelling?” In another letter which 
          she wrote upon receiving the copy of the July 1915 issue of <i>Others</i> 
          (in which the first four “Love Songs” appeared for the first time), she 
          observed:</span> </font>

        <blockquote>

            was rather sorry that some words were misprinted such as in pig-cupid—“sitting<b> 
            </b>the appraisable” instead of silting the appraisable—and “there are” 
            instead of “these are suspect places”.<a href="#note2">2</a></span></font></p>

          corrections in April 1917, when <i>Others </i>devoted a whole issue to 
          the complete set of 34 poems, the original misspelt version of the variously 
          named “Pig-Cupid” and “Love Song No.1” reappeared in the 1982 anthology 
          <i>Last Lunar Baedeker </i>(the misspelling of which was itself a further 
          case of contingent renaming in the history of this <i>oeuvre</i>).<a href="#note3">3</a> 
          <a name="back3"></a>However, this is still not the end of that particular 
          story since an essay by Thom Gunn published in 1988 provides yet another

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="back5"></a>The 
          indeterminate and provisional nature of the work was exacerbated partly 
          by such editorial inconsistencies and partly by her own resistance to 
          preset forms and closures. That textual variants and discrepancies might 
          sometimes be part of a deliberate strategy is suggested by the inclusion 
          of a list of tenets which she wrote in 1918 under the title of “Psycho 
          Democracy”<a href="#note6">6</a>: <a name="back6"></a>“Most movements 
          have a fixed<b> </b>concept toward which they advance, we move away from 
          all fixed concepts in order to advance.”(<i>LLB</i> 278) In her own words, 
          her writing was “tentative—intermittent—unfinishing.” Even here she uses 
          the present continuous—“unfinishing”—not “unfinished.” Features such as 
          gaps, dashes and syntactical anomalies, the use of idiosyncratic vocabulary, 
          including antiquated or rare forms of words, all serve to draw the reader’s 
          attention to formal (or informal) qualities of the writing, and put into 
          question the notion of the text as an autonomous entity which provides 
          unmediated access to a “real” world. They serve to emphasise the nature 
          of the poem as the site of ideological and psychological conflict where 
          contradictions and tensions remain unresolved.</span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
          aspect of the indeterminacy which surrounds Loy and her work is the misdating 
          of certain of her texts and paintings. Roger Conover asks: “When she misdated 
          her paintings, was she anticipating our posthumous eavesdropping and intentionally 
          throwing us off the track?”(<i>LLB</i> xviii) An answer to this question 
          is suggested by a particularly notable textual<b> </b>misdating, which 
          occurs on the original handwritten version of the poem ‘An Aged Woman’ 
          in which she writes:“[T]he past has come apart/events are vagueing/the 
          future is unexploitable.” This poem, the reflections of an old woman close 
          to death, is startlingly signed, “Mina Loy, July 12th 1984” (as if from 
          the grave, since Loy died in 1966). Like Conover, one is tempted to ask 
          whether this interference with time is deliberate playfulness in anticipation 
          of our “posthumous evesdroppings,” or a manifestation of amnesia on the 
          part of the elderly poet whose past had indeed begun to “come apart.”</span> 
          </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loy’s 
          deceptions have served her purpose of defying the constraints which are 
          enmeshed in language itself. When Colossus, the young hero in <i>Anglo-Mongrels 
          and the Rose,</i> declares that “All words are lies,” he expresses Loy’s 
          personal mistrust of language, her awareness of the way in which seemingly 
          transparent words are axiologically encoded. In particular, she called 
          into question the prevailing sexual ideologies of her time. In keeping 
          with the precepts of her confrontational “Feminist Manifesto” of 1914, 
          her writing is the assertion of her own status as a woman experimentalist 
          in the predominantly male communities of avant-garde artists and writers 
          within which she lived for much of her life. Although work is inextricably 
          linked to the subversive and iconoclastic activities of the Italian Futurists, 
          New York Dada and French Surrealists, her poetry also constitutes a challenge 
          to them, one which was specifically grounded in gender. The anxiety which 
          she experienced with regard to the oppressive constraints of patriarchy 
          upon her own subjectivity — constraints which manifest themselves in works 
          such as <i>Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose</i> and the unpublished<i> Islands 
          </i>and<i> Goy Israels</i>—is perhaps what she refers to when she says 
          that “this Book, constitutes my inhibition.” That is, having responded 
          to the imperative to contest patriarchy, once reified in a text, the very 
          fixity of the writing becomes, in itself, problematic. This may even explain, 
          in part, her compulsion to repeated revisions of the work.  </span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 
          Loy often adopts the revolutionary mode of the historical avant-gardes 
          among whom she lived and worked, and challenges the wider artistic and 
          cultural economies which the movements were themselves defying, she simultaneously 
          challenges some of the precepts of those same movements. Indeed, certain 
          of her early poems offer specific response to contemporary Futurist texts. 
          For example, the poem “One O’Clock at Night”(1915) engages satirically 
          with Marinetti’s “scorn for women” as expressed in <i>War, the World’s 
          Only Hygiene</i>.<a href="#note7">7</a><a name="back7"></a> Her poem begins, 
          “Though you had never possessed me/I had belonged to you since the beginning 
          of time.”(<i>LoLB</i> 15) The division of self (the independent “me”) 
          and other (the passive “I”) exemplifies the kind of internalised debate 
          which is a significant feature of much of Loy’s work. A Bakhtinian confrontation 
          takes place between an autonomous “me” who is “never possessed” in the 
          first line, and the acquiescent “I” of the second line, the voice of woman 
          described by the Futurist as “the tragic trinket, the fragile woman.”<a href="#note8">8</a> 
          This<a name="back8"></a> second voice speaks with a “sideways glance” 
          at her male companion, and at the Futurist discourse of misogyny which 
          exerts its own energy as it infiltrates the language of the poem. As well 
          as the <i>intra</i>subjective debate between “active” self and “passive” 
          other, there is also the <i>inter</i>subjective confrontation between 
          the woman poet and the Futurist. This ironic and mocking intonation, whereby 
          opposing views are contained within the same utterance, is what Bakhtin 
          referred to as “double voiced discourse.” </span> </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
          lines which follow, the poet addresses the Futurist directly, adopting 
          her allotted role, “purely animal,” and simultaneously distancing herself 
          from it by means of irony:</span> </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>And sleepily I sat on your chair beside you</span> <span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'><br>
            Leaning against your shoulder<br>
            </span>And your careless arm across my back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gesticulated<br>
            As your indisputable male voice   roared<br>
            <span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Through my brain and body</span><br>
            <span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Arguing dynamic decomposition<br>
            </span>Of which I understand nothing.  (<i>LoLB</i> 15) </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The gaps in the typography serve to stage the verbs which 
          follow (gesticulated and roared) by isolating and so amplifying them. 
          These gaps also self reflexively provide an example of “dynamic decomposition” 
          of which the poet denies all knowledge. This halting quality is a characteristic 
          of Bakhtin’s concept of the “sideway’s glance,” as the poetic voice mockingly 
          anticipates the criticism or reaction of the “indisputable” male voice.  
          </span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In “One 
          O’Clock in the Morning” the poet contests through irony the Futurist polemic 
          which, according to Marinetti, woman “without knowing it…is intimately 
          sure of being, as a mother, as a wife, and as a lover, a closed circle, 
          purely animal and wholly without usefulness.”<a href="#note9">9</a> In 
          <a name="back9"></a>the final lines of this poem, the thinking poet confronts 
          her own double, the sexual woman. The opposing drives of “animal” sexuality 
          and intellectual thought are both aroused by the bombastic futurist discussion, 
          variously described in a mildly amused tone as “cerebral gymnastics,” 
          the “self-indulgent play of children” and “thunder of alien gods.”</span>

          previous “sleepy” state of non intellectual passivity. Just as she has

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1920, 
          Loy returned to Florence after a four year absence. Here she encountered 
          the explosive atmosphere in which an intense power struggle was taking 
          place on the streets between Socialists, moderate Nationalists, and gangs 
          made up of loose associations of Fascists, <i>Arditi</i> and Futurists. 
          That she had, by this time, become profoundly disillusioned with Marinetti's 
          belligerence and with the Futurists’ enthusiastic participation in war 
          is apparent from the manifesto “Psycho-Democracy,” which was written in 
          1918 and published privately in Florence in 1920.<a href="#note10">10</a> 
          Here <a name="back10"></a>she expresses her personal cynicism concerning 
          the nationalisms which had contributed to the bloodshed of World War I, 
          and in contrast to Marinetti's description of war as “the world's only 
          hygiene,” describes military conflict as “the cataclysmic factor in social 
          evolution.”(<i>LLB </i>280)  In the poetry written during this period, 
          she throws down the gauntlet to Marinetti by manifestly employing the 
          symbolist tropes to which he had so loudly declared his bitter aversion 
          in the manifesto “We Abjure our Symbolist Masters, the Last Lovers of 
          the Moon.”<a href="#note11">11</a> His <a name="back11"></a>hatred of 
          the nostalgic poetry of Poe, Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Verlaine, and of  
          the so called “debilitating” influence of woman, was the ammunition with 
          which he had earlier mounted an attack on his rival in literature and 
          politics, the symbolist poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. The sensuality and romantic 
          sentimentality of Symbolism had provided the necessary antithesis against 
          which his own belligerence and aggression could be defined. He dissociated 
          Futurism from the language of Symbolism and, in the process, condemned 
          what he called the “enfeebling” influence of D’Annunzio, “lesser brother 
          of the great French Symbolists, nostalgic like them and like them hovering 
          above the naked female body.” Since it was precisely as a woman that Loy 
          contested Futurism, it was therefore appropriate that she should do so 
          by an assertion of symbolist tropes.  </span> </font>

          those artists who seek escape from the world in “lunar” flights from reality. 
          This reading does not, however, go far enough, since such a critique would 
          coincide with the disdain of Marinetti and the Futurists for those to 
          whom he refers ironically as “our Symbolist Masters.” However, there are 
          a number of ironic references in “Lunar Baedeker” which suggest that Loy’s 
          barbs are aimed not so much at the language of Symbolism as at Marinetti 
          himself. In 1909, the year in which they first became acquainted, Marinetti 
          had published an extravagant  Futurist fantasy entitled “Let’s Murder 
          the Moonshine,” in which a horde of Futurist artists sets out to “lay 
          the great military Railroad to the flanks of Gorisnakar, summit of the 
          world!” He writes: </font></span>

          have rendered it resistant to recuperation and to easy accommodation within 
          recognisable taxonomies.  Her own denial to Jonathan Williams in the 1950s 
          that she was ever a poet,<a href="#note21">21</a> and<a name="back21"></a> 
          her comment to an editor seeking contributor’s notes that “<i>I don’t 
          think anything biographical would be cheerful</i>” exemplify the strategies 
          by which she avoided the imposition of any kind of totalising or reifying 
          completion. Even her biographer Carolyn Burke admitted that she “had expected 
          more coherence from Loy’s autobiographical writings than finally emerged 
          once they were collated”<a href="#note22">22</a> but <a name="back22"></a>notes, 
          in her introduction to <i>Becoming Modern,</i> that this reluctance to 
          being categorised or “placed” anticipates the anarchic cultural world 
          of the postmodern. She writes, “It may be that in her multiplicity, Mina 
          speaks to us now, in the era of the postmodern, because she followed no 
          one path and did not present a unified body of work”<a href="#note23">23</a></span>

          Loy was perpetually driven by the imperative of resistance to break rules, 
          explore forbidden territories, and avoid the conclusive, preferring disguise 
          and even anonymity to “centrality” within the avant-garde. She held to 
          her place at the margin of the margins and her work was neglected as a 
          result. Luce Irigaray in <i>This Sex Which is Not One</i> might have been 
          speaking of Loy's slippery and elusive opus when she wrote of woman that: 
          “One must listen to her differently in order to hear an ‘other meaning’ 
          which is constantly in the process of weaving itself, at the same time 
          ceaselessly embracing words and yet casting them off to avoid becoming 
          fixed, immobilized.”</span><a href="#note24"><span
