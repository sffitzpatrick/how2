          </i></font></b><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          presentation I did for Romana Huk's conference was speedy, messy, and 
          resonant with the impact of the visual works displayed, of the quotes 
          read. It used unfinished thoughts for prompts. It promoted the experience 
          of other art projects and other practitioners as models for thinking about 
          writing and the project to hand. It set itself out to be a reflection 
          on the processes that had been animating my own thoughts at the initial 
          stages of the second part of my ongoing project Goan Atom. In fact, as 
          it turned out, it seemed to play a part in announcing this barely existing 
          work.   </font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A presentation 
          of research as brainstorming favours the kind of associative clarity and 
          memory jolts which much experience of art rests on. At an emotive level, 
          it breeds an excitement and enjoyment which does not know how to think. 
          At an intellectual level, it needs for questions to stand and for thinking 
          to become thoughts, before any focussed or exterior involvement or commitment 
          can actually take place.</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As I 
          again battle with the contradictions and preoccupations at the root of 
          much of my presentation (how deep is the bride? how does one do art today? 
          why should one? what is writing’s impact beyond the literary? how do I 
          respond ? how do I think to respond with my work? with my life?), I know 
          I haven’t come much “further”. Any sense of cohesion is embattled. Action 
          or activity is semi-paralysed. I am half-asleep. Or so it feels. In this 
          sense, there is something vaguely humiliating and challenging in releasing 
          these presentation notes. Yet it is also the only exciting proposition. 
          What you have here is a synopsis, as much a panoply of methods detected 
          as a record of things read. The bibliography has been added for ease of 
          access.</font></i></p>

          thoughts:<br>
          </i>In that the body as conceptual and biological apparatus represents 
          a storage both for different politics and cultural approaches to anatomy, 
          and a shoring up of art’s libidinal articulations and accentuations (from 
          glottis to glossia), varying genres of textual modality which claim the 
          body as working-model make most sense when seen as discontinuous yet interdependent, 
          yet joined network of activities. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The physicalisation 
          and dispersal of writing through live readings, spoken recordings, text 
          environments reflects in this respect a link between writing and physical 
          construction/intervention in the public sphere.</font></p>

          </b>Sometimes a witness to events before they actually occur.  Like <b>Felix 
          Gonzales-Torres</b>, who gave things to people, art is to do with our

          we should look at society’s artists.”<br>
          “In my own art and also in art after the destruction of the Berlin wall, 
          form has become less important.  With the Minimalists, form was hugely 
          important, but that doesn’t happen in work of today.  Form represents 
          a kind of belief – for example that there is a right way of doing art 
          – but now that isn’t the case.  Now we’re concerned with the right way 
          of speaking to someone; there is no form that is right forever.  And that 
          also signifies the end of Utopia. Now I find it equally important to work
