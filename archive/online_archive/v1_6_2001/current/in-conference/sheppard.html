        The Saying and the Said</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        binary terms Emmanuel Levinas uses to express ethical dialogue following 
        his linguistic turn of the 1960s—the saying and the said—seem to be particularly 
        pertinent to modes of poetry that keep the literal saying of performance 
        open as opposed to the apparent fixity of the silent page. Performance 
        as a valorised notion in the discourse of recent Linguistically Innovative 
        Poetry is interrogated in this paper in the light of Levinas’ distinction, 
        which he delineated succinctly:  </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Language 
          as <i>saying </i>is an ethical openness to the other; as that which 
          is <i>said</i>— reduced to a fixed identity or synchronized presence—it 
          is an ontological closure of the other.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Saying 
        is the call of, the call to, the other, and the fact of the need and obligation 
        to respond to, and become responsible for, the other, in Levinas’ difficult 
        thinking.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a> It is a transcendental state beyond being, yet 
        it is also “a performative doing” as Simon Critchley puts it.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a> It is the site and performance of ethics because 
        of the obligation to respond. It is public, yet it doesn’t communicate 
        anything but the desire to communicate. Thus explained it seems like a 
        philosophical version of interhuman phatic communion that precedes, or 
        even replaces, actual informational communication. Indeed Levinas has 
        indicated that passing the time of day about the weather may embody such 
        a gesture. As he explains: “Saying opens me to the other before saying 
        what is said.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title="">4</a> We cannot, as in his everyday example, but not reply (even with 
        silence). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However—and 
        this is where the complexity for poetics enters this dichotomy—we cannot 
        simply valorise <i>saying</i> as performance over the <i>said</i> as non- 
        or anti-performance; the saying is not found other than interwoven with 
        the said. Robert Eaglestone explains: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is 
          impossible to say the saying because at the moment of saying it becomes 
          the said, betrayed by the concrete language which is the language of 
          ontology. The saying, which is unthematizable, impossible to delimit, 
          becomes limited, thematized, said.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a> 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
        the saying as a “performative doing,”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a> 
        is what interrupts the said, ruptures the said. The saying “appears” as 
        a knot catching in the thread of the said, yet conversely, “The said...arises 
        in the saying.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a> It is the 
        point at which “clarity occurs, and thought aims at themes.”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">8</a> 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        saying and the said both support, yet react against, one another.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
        poetry is successful it is arguably able to articulate that saying in 
        the said of the dialogic performance of the book. A successful reading 
        will be one that exposes the saidness of the text to an openness of performance 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given 
        that there is already a pun here on the word “reading” as both the act 
        of silent reading and on the kinds of public performance that have been 
        relatively popular since the 1950s, is telling. Given that the former 
        is, in these terms, also a mode of performative action, the specificity 
        of the latter is under question, is in need of justification. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2: 
        Love Letters in the Sound</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
        poetry reading or performance by Maggie O’Sullivan can baffle or delight, 
        baffle <i>and</i> delight. The steady stream of words, delivered with 
        careful attention to their rhythmic weight, to their alliterative connections, 
        seemingly at the expense of their meanings, can be a difficult experience 
        to relate to, for those not used to it. In “A Love Letter,” Adrian Clarke, 
        becomes Roland Barthes’ blissful reader, finding himself desired by a 
        text from her 1993 Reality Street book, <i>In the House of the Shaman</i>. 
        He explained: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For those 
          of us who have attended any of her readings, these pages summon Maggie—never 
          one to function as the institution “author,” rather a figure “lost in 
          the midst of a text”—whose striking if not conventionally beautiful 
          dark Irish features are transformed, transfused with beauty as she reads 
          unhurriedly letting the measured syllables relate to establish rhythms 
          in an appropriate time.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">9</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        poetry demands a greater dialogue with, response from, its readers than 
        most. The reader or listener has to be prepared for a structure that is 
        largely organized by sound and has to pay attention to the particular 
        and peculiar lineation, spacing and punctuation on the page. The connection 
        between the powerful sonic features and a revitalized semantics is precisely 
        through her preference for the portmanteau word and the pun. Neologism 
        is so complete that at times we are offered a controlled experiment in 
        language change. O’Sullivan changes the endings of words and changes their 
        case, something which takes centuries in ‘natural’ language: “missingly”; 
        “yonderly”; “gived.”<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a> She invents new lexical items, 
        some fairly simple, “twindom” as a doubled domain,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">11</a> 
        but others approach the polysemenous Joycean pun: “superates”; “reversionary.”<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">12</a>  New compounds surprise: “Sylla/bled” 
        takes a word apart, and emphasizes utterance as suffering, sliced on enjambment, 
        uniquely connected to breathing.<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title="">13</a></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Derek 
        Attridge writes in <i>Peculiar Language</i> that this particular form 
        of linguistic inventiveness, the portmanteau word, “refuses, by itself, 
        any single meaning, and in reading we have to nudge it towards other signifiers 
        whose meanings might prove appropriate.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title="">14</a> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus 
        sound, or soundings, the performative aspect of the poetry, opens the 
        reader, through semantics (and the semantic suggestions of grammatical 
        units, such as prefixes, and, by extension, through etymological roots), 
        to conceptual richness. Attridge, writing of lexical onomatopoeia, deals 
        with this single form of neologism in a way which emphasizes this, and 
        is relevant to the devices and techniques of O’Sullivan’s work. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All speech 
          involves muscular movements…and the particular aspects of this complex 
          physical process which function in a given example of onomatopoeia depend 
          less on the specific configurations of the phonetic sequence in question 
          than on the meaning of the passage. The result is a diversion of attention 
          away from the referent in itself to the activity of referring carried 
          out by language…And it is that focus of attention upon the materiality 
          of language as it does its work of bringing meaning into being that 
          has so often been interpreted as mimetic or iconic representation, because 
          the experience is unquestionably one of increased vividness or intensity 
          of signification.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">15</a> 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        reader has to recognize a moment which resembles language being born rather 
        than language being used to represent something, the moment saying exists 
        without regard to the said which will finally capture it. It is not consciousness 
        that the reader sees unfolding, as in the Joycean stream of consciousness 
        technique. It is almost as if an ideolect, a personal register of language, 
        becomes a loose sociolect that the audience temporarily shares, nudging 
        away at the lexical items, entering it in social dialogue. This is never 
        more so than in the communal space of a public reading where the saying 
        may be literally kept open (but, as I shall argue, may not always be open 
        in a Levinasian sense).  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        process of writing these poems might best be thought of as a series of 
        transformations of descriptive language into exuberant and performative 
        language, a transformation that is fully aware that the material of poetry 
        is not perception—however important—but language. There is a strange tension 
        in the literary influences—late Romantic and extreme Modernist—on Maggie 
        O’Sullivan’s work, which reflects the tensions within it. Like Hopkins, 
        sound seems to function as onamatapoeaic equivalence of “all things hitting 
        the sense with double but direct instress” as he put it, to match the 
        perceptual imprint of “great brilliancy and projection” of phenomenal 
        nature, which strikes the eye before it is transformed into sound: “the 
        eye seemed to fall perpendicular from level to level along our trees, 
        the nearer and further Park.”<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title="">16</a></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
        Kurt Schwitters’ use of detritus and mistakes in his visual collages, 
        as well as pure sound in his poetry, such as the extended <i>Ur Sonate</i>, 
        as O’Sullivan puts it, “showed the retrieval of potentials within materials,”<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">17</a> pointed towards the medium itself, 
        towards “saying saying saying” as Levinas attempts to describe it. <a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title="">18</a> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
        this poetry passes from precision to exuberance, it attempts to link the 
        verbal equivalence of Hopkins and the artistic autonomy of Schwitters, 
        but with Schwitters’ admission of error and mistake into the creative 
        process, as the richness of pun: a kind of communal hallucinatory malapropism.

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3: 
        The Naming and the Named</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">O’Sullivan’s 
        “Naming,” comes from a section of <i>In The House of the Shaman</i>, called 
        “Kinship with Animals.” Its epigraph—and indeed, the title of the volume—is 
        drawn from Joseph Beuys, the German installation and performance artist. 
        O’Sullivan describes working on the BBC Arena programme on Beuys in the 
        late eighties, appropriately, as a “transformative experience.”<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">19</a> It is no wonder that Beuys, who 
        also grappled with these tensions between a fidelity to nature amid the 
        creation of cultural artefacts, should be such an ethical figure for O’Sullivan. 
        The only way to make language shift like the lard that Beuys transformed 
        is to work with the instability within the linguistic sign, “underneath, 
        behind, with language,” as Maggie O’Sullivan says.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">20</a> 
        This materiality engenders a paradoxical freedom to transform, something 
        found in Beuys’ lard sculptures. The epigraph provides the necessary philosophic 
        stance for O’Sullivan’s balancing and fusing, even confusing, of natural 
        processes and cultural materialism: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To stress 
          the idea of transformation and of substance. This is precisely what 
          the shaman does in order to bring about change and development: his 
          nature is therapeutic.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">21</a></font></p>

        </sup>whose emphatic last line is “This is called fish,” is certainly 
        not pure music, but it does not offer the certainties of denotation that 
        it might seem to promise. “Water/they unlidder” the poem begins, refusing 
        yet to name, offering a half rhyme for “water,” the element upon which 
        the poem focuses. To unlid something would be to remove its lid, to open; 
        lidder would seem to be also a noun, but operates as a verb here, and 
        makes the act of “unliddering” seem, through sound, through grammar, a 
        very deliberate one: opening the perceptive eyes perhaps as the lids part, 
        though it seems more violent, to rip the lids away for permanent seeing, 
        though it is the water’s surface the unnamed “they” peel away. (If they 
        are fish, they have no lids themselves, of course.) The water’s surface 
        is also broken by the named and noisy “scraping fowls.” </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        the sound of the word “shrieve” one can hear the “hurtling” of the birds, 
        as in Hopkins’ onomatapoaeic “the whole landscape flushes on a sudden 
        at a sound.”<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">23</a><sup> </sup>But 
        the Old English etymology of the word points to an act of confession, 
        the Latin to the act of writing. Together they suggest a document as a 
        testament. The bird’s natural motion becomes a cultural inscription, or 
        is seen in terms of one. Wings and pieces of paper can both be folded, 
        both are possible concealments, of that which is confessed. The scraping 
        on the water is an hieroglyphics of sorts, cut with a blade that could 
        be a fowl’s wing, hence the parts of words and dots and dashes, the disturbance 
        on water.  This act of descriptive precision is turning into a description 
        of a Maggie O’Sullivan poem, into its own material saying, the abruptness 
        of its own punctuation, its sudden suffixes.</font></p>

        a bespoke sense of quality) and—the third a characteristic O’Sullivan 
        neologism—attentive listening (and attentive listening to the word will 
        reveal the word “beard,” a name of certain wild flowers). As she asserts 
        elsewhere, uniting the three aspects in the activities of an “I”: “lip

title="">24</a></sup> Whether or not we are in the presence of a dragon’s breath, 
        there is an “ear-Load” more of transformation in the phrase or word “plum-BURR”: 
        plumage be-comes plum, cut down. Plum is a colour, BURR a sound, a choke 
        in the throat. Plum is a fruit, also, and burr, through another definition, 
        the seed case of the fruit; these connotations stress an interchangeable 
        yet changing natural environment. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The

        the sense of measuring the depth of water, whether lidded or not, which 
        the poem enacts. Be eared, the poem seems to say, to the polysemantics 
        of nature: colour and fruition; be kin to animals (because we are akin, 
        as the title of the section reminds us). But the semantics are held off 
        by the thick devicehood of the poem, its saying glorified in the act of 
        being born in our reading, and dying only slowly into the thematized fixity 
        of our interpretations, particularly as we follow words through their 
        etymologies and connotations. As a reader follows such semantic trails 
        he or she must retreat from the actual performance of the poem, a paradox

        play. If this is description then the objects described are largely displaced. 
        It is instructive to see how O’Sullivan herself deals with this dichotomy 
        between linguistic autonomy and reference to the natural world, in her 
        poetics essay “riverruning (realisations” which itself is a collage of 
        quotations from her own, and others’, works, and from a number of intentional 
        and autobiographical statements, in which she amplifies upon influences 
        and tensions identified earlier. On the one hand she speaks of Kurt Schwitters’ 
        “superb use of the UN—the NON and the LESS—the UNREGARDED, the found, 
        the cast-offs, the dismembered materials of culture.”<sup>24</sup> Again, 
        Hopkins provides the balance to Schwitters, since O’Sullivan speaks, in 
        tones reminiscent of Hopkins’ theory of instress, of her leaving London 
        “to the moorland impress of tongue.”<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"

        straggled this divide convincingly and it is interesting to see “riverruning

        the natural. The force of the word “Also” in this passage separates these

        the processes of the natural world lead to the evolutionary changes, in 
        what we call natural history, the changes of language (either real in 
        etymology in the history of the language, or new in the neologistic play 
        of the text), lead to changes in the poem’s language. Her work embodies 
        that “Also” that connects the two. But it is the embodiment that explains 
        how Maggie O’Sullivan imagines the Also to be an And.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        link, of course, is in the materiality of the literary work and the physicality 
        of nature: “Articulations of the Earth of Language,” “a Mattering of Materials,” 
        <a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">28</a> where “mattering” hints 
        at both material reality and signification; materials are no longer simply 
        cultural.<sup> </sup>But there is more than just an equivalence here, 
        and the roles of sound in language and language in the body need exploring 
        with reference to performance itself. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        text in performance is a version of shamanistic therapy, how is it administered? 
        The answer may lie in Adrian Clarke’s assertion that it is O’Sullivan’s 
        person—her body—that is transformed as she reads the texts, and in Attridge’s 
        remarks about the muscular aspects of signification.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bakhtin’s 
        early essay “Content, Material, and Form in Verbal Art,” focuses, rarely 
        for Bakhtin, upon poetry, and argues that the transformation of material 
        into architectonics, of technique into aesthetic object, and the making 
        of the poem, “allows the author-creator to become a constitutive moment 
        of form.”<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">29</a> “The feeling 
        of verbal activeness, the feeling of the active generation of signifying 
        <i>sound</i>” is the governing moment of poetry, a moment that could happen 
        on the page, (the irruption of thingness, as I call it) but I believe 
        is particularly re-created and fulfilled in performance; <a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"
title="">30</a><sup> </sup>it is “a moment into which both the organism and meaning-directed 
        activity are drawn, because both the flesh and the spirit [the signifier 
        and the signified I take him to mean] are generated together in this concrete 
        unity.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">31</a><sup> </sup></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Theory 
        may have recently seen the re-birth of the author, but not yet, I think, 
        as performer, but Bakhtin points towards ways of achieving that: “The 
        movement that generates acoustical sound, and is most active in the articulatory 
        organs, although it takes hold of the whole organism...is incommensurably 
        more important than what is <i>heard,</i>” not in a retreat from meaning, 
        but because the poem has “taken possession of the whole active human being.”<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title="">32</a> This literal incarnation, at the moment that 
        poetic language comes into being is what O’Sullivan achieves when she 
        turns ideolect to a kind of dialect. Her “Earloads” are becoming <i>physical</i> 
        burdens, for the performer-poet, as in Bakhtin’s formulation of the lyric, 
        “when the body, generating the sound from within itself and feeling the 
        unity of its own productive exertion, is drawn into form.”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title="">33</a> This birth of language (a metaphor which unites nature and culture) 
        is indeed a glorification of productive exertion in the body: the word 
        made flesh. It is also the most poignant example of a saying that pre-empts 
        the power of the said. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        believe that what the exuberance of O’Sullivan’s work—particularly its 
        sonic performance—is trying to do is to find a further productive unity: 
        one between culture and nature—to replicate the productive exertion of 
        the natural forces she celebrates. Kinship with animals implies making 
        the poem a part of organic nature, which is only possible <i>through</i> 
        sound, articulated <i>through</i> the living body of the poet, in writing, 
        but more publicly, in the dialect become sociolect of performance. The 
        performance of poetry is the “Be-coming” of the text.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        hallucinatory ideolect of the O’Sullivan performance may engender temporary 
        modalities of being, of creating, in its own way, what Felix Guattari 
        called “mutant subjectivities” for the audience, that constitute a “preliminary 
        deconstruction of the structures and codes in use and a chaosmic plunge 
        into the materials of sensation. Out of them a recomposition becomes possible,” 
        says Guattari. <a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">34</a> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How 
        can the ideolect-cum-dialect of any poetry performance become a shared 
        sociolect? I believe that Guattari’s reading—re-writing—of the Bakhtin 
        essay provides one theoretical answer. In <i>Chaosmosis</i> he identifies 
        Bakhtin’s sense of the verbal activity which gives autonomy to content 
        and engenders activity in the author and audience with his own notion 
        of the “ritornello” or “refrain.” </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
        refrain is a detached existential motif which orders chaos and assists 
        the process of subjectivation. His examples of the refrain range from 
        enabling and territorial birdsong through to the condition of an individual 
        watching the TV, where his or her subjectivity is polyphonized by existing 
        at the intersections of disparate experiences on and off the screen. The 
        refrain “acts upon that which surrounds it, sound or light, extracting 
        from its various vibrations or decompositions, projections, transformations.”<a href="#_ftn35"
name="_ftnref35" title="">35</a> It ruptures the dominant redundancies and catalyses 
        their re-combination in a sort of multidimensional epiphany. The refrain 
        function in Maggie O’Sullivan’s text and performance is this very exuberant 
        creation of temporary dialect, or even sociolect, the sensation of linguistic 
        activity of which Bakhtin speaks, the catalysing of what feels like meaning 
        being created, doubly, through sound, through the specialized semantics 
        of neologism. Indeed, Guattari says that performance art engenders a process 
        of existential detachment and disordering which is then supplemented by 
        existential <i>recomposition</i> of the fragments for the audience.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Poetry 
        in performance, whatever its tensions, can be argued to be the production 
        of a productivity: always of machinic combinations of different elements 
        of poetic language and performance events.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">36</a> 
        Catalyzing changes in both authors and readers could potentially assist, 
        in a new aesthetic paradigm of experience, the individual and collective 
        means of producing healthily polyphonic subjectivities, capable of achieving 
        autonomy or “autopoesis,” as Guattari would say. “Thus it is not only 
        in the context of music and poetry that we see the work of such fragments 
        detached from content...the polyphony of modes of subjectivation actually 
        corresponds to a multiplicity of ways of ‘keeping time.’ Other rhythmics 
        are thus led to crystallize existential assemblages.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">37</a></font></p>

        The anthology also contains the work of O’Sullivan. <a href="#_ftn38"

        lards the interstices between words with other words, word-parts and anagram, 
        uses enjambment to prise open lexical items (in a manner reminiscent of 
        Maggie O’Sullivan) and suggests performance in its notation; it already

        (the quoted song) and the random (sudden dips of tone or squeaky falsettos). 
        The “text” itself is also its performance and its subsequent transformations. 
        The risk is that it might be performed or re-inscribed in less, as well

        cheek has been exploring hybrid forms of writing.<a href="#_ftn47"
name="_ftnref47" title="">47</a> Theirs is a stance which acknowledges that writing 
        itself <i>is</i> performance, which is at once liberating and limiting, 
        for the question has to be asked: what will <i>not</i> be performance? 
        If everything is performance, then what specific value does this category 
        have? </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ignoring 
        these questions for a moment, one could argue that performance that includes 
        poetry, particularly in an expanded context such as an environment or 
        an installation piece, such as that discussed by Bergvall, or cris cheek’s 
        recordings, is a machinic productivity <i>out from</i> text, <i>alongside</i> 
        texts, <i>into</i> texts, in a flexible multisystemic activity, and its 
        aims are, as Guattari would say, indeed did say, of performance art: “a 
        forward flight into machinations and deterritorialized machinic paths 
        capable of engendering mutant subjectivities...a proliferation not just 
        of forms but of modalities of being.”<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">48</a>  
        In such a formulation, tensions and contradictions are not problems but 
        productive complexities with a role that is not exclusively literary. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
        theorize performance in terms of Deleuzoguattarian machinic productivity 
        suggests an irreversible, unpredictable activity, but it also avoids certain 
        ways of thinking that might prioritise combined media in a live art context, 
        or relationships between elements, or impose models of unity, such as 
        metaphors of fusion, synthesis, organic wholeness, or counterpoint. To 
        think of the elements as machines allows for the development of simultaneous, 
        asymmetric processes, of finding the work in performance, of finding unprescribed 
        relationships or even lacks of relationship. Finally this suggests both 
        the transformation of all the possible elements and their potential breakdown 
        as performance develops. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Perhaps 
        once this stage has been reached it is no longer possible to speak of 
        poetry as an autonomous art-form. On one’s attachment to the particularities 
        of the art-form—its linguistic complexity, its etymological richness, 
        which are so important in O’Sullivan’s text, for example—will depend one’s 
        response to such hybrid productivity. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        liberation of text from the page, and ever widening definitions put “performance” 
        as a term squarely at the heart of Linguistically Innovative Poetry. For 
        so long it has been assumed, particularly in the Pound-Olson tradition 
        that the supposed connection between verse and music (and dance) subsisted 
        until the Renaissance and was undone by the rise of  “print-bred poetry” 
        as Olson put it, with its practice of silent solitary reading: “What we 
        have suffered from, is manuscript, press, the removal of verse from its 
        producer and its reproducer, the voice, a removal...from its place of 
        origin <i>and</i> its destination.”<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"
title="">49</a></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
        recently less attention has been directed towards what may have been gained 
        rather than lost in such developments, particularly in the ways trained 
        readers respond to the page. To use the term “audience” (rather than reader) 
        might be thought a neutral term, but to privilege the auditory to is underplay 
        other aspects of poetic artifice. For one, we need to consider, to use 
        the deceptively simple title of a recent book, “the look of it.”<a href="#_ftn50"
name="_ftnref50" title="">50</a> Olson, of course, sang the praises of the typewriter, 
        though chiefly as a scoring device for breath performance. O’Sullivan’s 
        texts use space meticulously, not just as a score for performance—that 
        would render such meaningful artifice secondary, less meaningful—but as 
        a primary field for the play of devices. Her work is an example of what 
        Marjorie Perloff calls “the new nonlinear poetries” that have extended 
        the range of so-called free verse, which she has also argued is itself 
        primarily a visual, not a rhythmical, ordering.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">51</a> 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">“Naming” 
        is a conservative, linear, poem, by O’Sullivan’s standards, though even 
        here, where the materiality of language is emphasized (those dots, dashes 
        and suffixes) the lines are indented. The “plum-BURR” repeated thrice, 
        is indented, visually isolated (as is the last line, as I have said). 
        It is as though, in order to consider the range of connotations this lexical 
        item contains, in order to open up the realm of the saying it inaugurates, 
        we must stop, or pause, the different saying of performance. The reader 
        needs to hold dialogue, to mentally scribble in the white space, to allow 
        the semantics of neologism, its avenues of connotation, to unfold.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Indeed, there may be aspects of sound in poetry that operate in a non-performative 
        way, or in a way that re-defines performance. The problem of my theoretical 
        use of the concepts of the saying and the said (despite my re-definitions 
        in terms of reading and the read, even naming and the named) is that saying 
        suggests oral performance while the said suggests a page-based reception 
        of text. I am aware that Bergvall’s descriptions of performance writing 
        indicate more than the verbal, but she emphasizes the textual as the starting 
        point.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Christopher 
        Middleton has theorized a discrimination of “voices” in the poetic text 
        that is relevant here, and suggests another way of theorizing Bakhtin’s 
        sense of the author’s autopoesis, one which questions the performance 
        and the performed. There exists “an imaginary voice, a voice that was 
        launched by his [the poet’s], but one that has a distinct imprint. That 
        imaginary and unmistakeable voice is a kind of <i>endophone</i>.”<a
href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title="">52</a> This is not to be confused with 
        “the exophones or voices with which we speak and to which we listen under 
        ordinary conditions.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">53</a> 
        More importantly, while the endophone is “time-traversing” the time of 
        performance imposes limitations, supplies simplifications, along with 
        its undoubted permissions.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">54</a></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Performances 
          can raise such sound-sequences into profile. Actual vocalizing, unless 
          it is vitiated by histrionics, can nourish the inner ear’s competence 
          to pick up and assemble sequences. Yet the inner ear is capable of an 
          auditory complexity which exceeds almost any audible vocalizing: the 
          latter tends to be reductive, if not falsifying, also it may straighten 
          out shocks and distortions which, to the inner ear, are part of the 
          real thing that is the voice in the text and the delight of the text.<a href="#_ftn55"

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Middleton 
        offers a counterbalance to the author-centred reading, or any verbal performance, 
        which again places dialogue with the reader at the centre of aesthetic 
        exchange, the reading acting as the “other” of the read. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It could 
          be argued that it is the act of silent, or at most murmured reading 
          ...which can realize the vocal qualities of a text, the sequences of 
          sounds, the timbres, the tonal colourings. That kind of act, reading 
          from a page... can also <i>dwell</i> on patterns of sound, as they exfoliate 
          and intertwine, so as to arrive at a fullbodied perception of the relations 
          (phonic, semantic, syntagmatic) which are being voiced here and now 
          in the text.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"
title="">56</a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Performance 
        may feel ontologically represssive if the condition of saying inherent 
        in a text may only fully be realized by a reader in dialogue with the 
        text, unfolding its sounds in the variable temporalities that reading 
        and memory allow, a virtual performance of an endophone separate from 
        the actualities (however well performed) of the author’s (or other performers’) 
        exophones.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">57</a> It is when 
        the to and fro of this virtual reading, this arrest of temporal sequencing, 
        is lost that performance might be thought to remove a vital empowerment 
        of the reader. Whatever other machinic senses of catalytic change performance 
        and live art may engender, it will be a different empowerment, as I have 
        suggested above, one that might leave the potentialities of poetic artifice 
        behind. My insistence upon a poetry that foregrounds its saying as against 
        its said may be more fully present in the kinds of endophonic reading 
        proposed by Middleton, during which the visual and the aural, the performative 
        and the semantic, work together in the reader-controlled temporality of 
        reception. We need to acknowledge the private performance of the silent 
        reader, or near silent reader murmuring, opening the text to its spectral 
        saying on the saidness of the material page. Indeed, is this not another 
        site for experiencing the Deleuzzoguattarian refrain?  It is the challenge 
        for those working in performance with text—and O’Sullivan, Williamson, 
        cheek and Bergvall have been highlighted here as exemplars—to keep that 
        dialogic aspect of poetry alive, even if it no longer calls itself poetry.</font></p>

          working both as residues of performance poetics and as scripts for performative 
          interpretation. This generates ambiguities for readers more used to 
          studying texts in order to establish an ideal or finalized close reading. 
          Writing which offers a formalist plenitude of performative potential 
          nevertheless tends to be insufficiently determinate for readers otherwise 
          happy with performative approaches”(8).</font></p>

          while acting as a saying for a performer (as Bakhtin suggests) might 
          operate as a said for the reader. The thematics in such a situation 
          may not so much be the semantics of a text, but the excess of performance 
          that thematizes itself as performance, as an event in which the audience 
          does not participate.</font></p>
