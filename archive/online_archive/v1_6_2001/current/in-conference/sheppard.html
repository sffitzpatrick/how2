          The Saying and the Said</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          binary terms Emmanuel Levinas uses to express ethical dialogue following 
          his linguistic turn of the 1960s—the saying and the said—seem to be particularly 
          pertinent to modes of poetry that keep the literal saying of performance 
          open as opposed to the apparent fixity of the silent page. Performance 
          as a valorised notion in the discourse of recent Linguistically Innovative 
          Poetry is interrogated in this paper in the light of Levinas’ distinction, 
          which he delineated succinctly:  </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Language 
            as <i>saying </i>is an ethical openness to the other; as that which 
            is <i>said</i>— reduced to a fixed identity or synchronized presence—it 
            is an ontological closure of the other.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Saying 
          is the call of, the call to, the other, and the fact of the need and obligation 
          to respond to, and become responsible for, the other, in Levinas’ difficult 
          thinking.<a href="#_ftn2"
  name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a> It is a transcendental state beyond being, yet 
          it is also “a performative doing” as Simon Critchley puts it.<a href="#_ftn3"
  name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a> It is the site and performance of ethics because 
          of the obligation to respond. It is public, yet it doesn’t communicate 
          anything but the desire to communicate. Thus explained it seems like a 
          philosophical version of interhuman phatic communion that precedes, or 
          even replaces, actual informational communication. Indeed Levinas has 
          indicated that passing the time of day about the weather may embody such 
          a gesture. As he explains: “Saying opens me to the other before saying 
          what is said.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
  title="">4</a> We cannot, as in his everyday example, but not reply (even with 
          silence). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However—and 
          this is where the complexity for poetics enters this dichotomy—we cannot 
          simply valorise <i>saying</i> as performance over the <i>said</i> as non- 
          or anti-performance; the saying is not found other than interwoven with 
          the said. Robert Eaglestone explains: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is 
            impossible to say the saying because at the moment of saying it becomes 
            the said, betrayed by the concrete language which is the language of 
            ontology. The saying, which is unthematizable, impossible to delimit, 
            becomes limited, thematized, said.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a> 
            </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
          the saying as a “performative doing,”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a> 
          is what interrupts the said, ruptures the said. The saying “appears” as 
          a knot catching in the thread of the said, yet conversely, “The said...arises 
          in the saying.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a> It is the 
          point at which “clarity occurs, and thought aims at themes.”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">8</a> 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          saying and the said both support, yet react against, one another.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
          poetry is successful it is arguably able to articulate that saying in 
          the said of the dialogic performance of the book. A successful reading 
          will be one that exposes the saidness of the text to an openness of performance 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Given 
          that there is already a pun here on the word “reading” as both the act 
          of silent reading and on the kinds of public performance that have been 
          relatively popular since the 1950s, is telling. Given that the former 
          is, in these terms, also a mode of performative action, the specificity 
          of the latter is under question, is in need of justification. </font></p>

          Love Letters in the Sound</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          poetry reading or performance by Maggie O’Sullivan can baffle or delight, 
          baffle <i>and</i> delight. The steady stream of words, delivered with 
          careful attention to their rhythmic weight, to their alliterative connections, 
          seemingly at the expense of their meanings, can be a difficult experience 
          to relate to, for those not used to it. In “A Love Letter,” Adrian Clarke, 
          becomes Roland Barthes’ blissful reader, finding himself desired by a 
          text from her 1993 Reality Street book, <i>In the House of the Shaman</i>. 
          He explained: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For those 
            of us who have attended any of her readings, these pages summon Maggie—never 
            one to function as the institution “author,” rather a figure “lost in 
            the midst of a text”—whose striking if not conventionally beautiful 
            dark Irish features are transformed, transfused with beauty as she reads 
            unhurriedly letting the measured syllables relate to establish rhythms 
            in an appropriate time.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">9</a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
          poetry demands a greater dialogue with, response from, its readers than 
          most. The reader or listener has to be prepared for a structure that is 
          largely organized by sound and has to pay attention to the particular 
          and peculiar lineation, spacing and punctuation on the page. The connection 
          between the powerful sonic features and a revitalized semantics is precisely 
          through her preference for the portmanteau word and the pun. Neologism 
          is so complete that at times we are offered a controlled experiment in 
          language change. O’Sullivan changes the endings of words and changes their 
          case, something which takes centuries in ‘natural’ language: “missingly”; 
          “yonderly”; “gived.”<a
  href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a> She invents new lexical items, 
          some fairly simple, “twindom” as a doubled domain,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">11</a> 
          but others approach the polysemenous Joycean pun: “superates”; “reversionary.”<a
  href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">12</a>  New compounds surprise: “Sylla/bled” 
          takes a word apart, and emphasizes utterance as suffering, sliced on enjambment, 
          uniquely connected to breathing.<a href="#_ftn13"
  name="_ftnref13" title="">13</a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Derek 
          Attridge writes in <i>Peculiar Language</i> that this particular form 
          of linguistic inventiveness, the portmanteau word, “refuses, by itself, 
          any single meaning, and in reading we have to nudge it towards other signifiers 
          whose meanings might prove appropriate.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
  title="">14</a> </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus 
          sound, or soundings, the performative aspect of the poetry, opens the 
          reader, through semantics (and the semantic suggestions of grammatical 
          units, such as prefixes, and, by extension, through etymological roots), 
          to conceptual richness. Attridge, writing of lexical onomatopoeia, deals 
          with this single form of neologism in a way which emphasizes this, and 
          is relevant to the devices and techniques of O’Sullivan’s work. </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All speech 
            involves muscular movements…and the particular aspects of this complex 
            physical process which function in a given example of onomatopoeia depend 
            less on the specific configurations of the phonetic sequence in question 
            than on the meaning of the passage. The result is a diversion of attention 
            away from the referent in itself to the activity of referring carried 
            out by language…And it is that focus of attention upon the materiality 
            of language as it does its work of bringing meaning into being that 
            has so often been interpreted as mimetic or iconic representation, because 
            the experience is unquestionably one of increased vividness or intensity 
            of signification.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">15</a> 
            </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          reader has to recognize a moment which resembles language being born rather 
          than language being used to represent something, the moment saying exists 
          without regard to the said which will finally capture it. It is not consciousness 
          that the reader sees unfolding, as in the Joycean stream of consciousness 
          technique. It is almost as if an ideolect, a personal register of language, 
          becomes a loose sociolect that the audience temporarily shares, nudging 
          away at the lexical items, entering it in social dialogue. This is never 
          more so than in the communal space of a public reading where the saying 
          may be literally kept open (but, as I shall argue, may not always be open 
          in a Levinasian sense).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          process of writing these poems might best be thought of as a series of 
          transformations of descriptive language into exuberant and performative 
          language, a transformation that is fully aware that the material of poetry 
          is not perception—however important—but language. There is a strange tension 
          in the literary influences—late Romantic and extreme Modernist—on Maggie 
          O’Sullivan’s work, which reflects the tensions within it. Like Hopkins, 
          sound seems to function as onamatapoeaic equivalence of “all things hitting 
          the sense with double but direct instress” as he put it, to match the 
          perceptual imprint of “great brilliancy and projection” of phenomenal 
          nature, which strikes the eye before it is transformed into sound: “the 
          eye seemed to fall perpendicular from level to level along our trees, 
          the nearer and further Park.”<a href="#_ftn16"
  name="_ftnref16" title="">16</a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Yet 
          Kurt Schwitters’ use of detritus and mistakes in his visual collages, 
          as well as pure sound in his poetry, such as the extended <i>Ur Sonate</i>, 
          as O’Sullivan puts it, “showed the retrieval of potentials within materials,”<a
  href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">17</a> pointed towards the medium itself, 
          towards “saying saying saying” as Levinas attempts to describe it. <a href="#_ftn18"
  name="_ftnref18" title="">18</a> </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
          this poetry passes from precision to exuberance, it attempts to link the 
          verbal equivalence of Hopkins and the artistic autonomy of Schwitters, 
          but with Schwitters’ admission of error and mistake into the creative 
          process, as the richness of pun: a kind of communal hallucinatory malapropism.

          The Naming and the Named</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">O’Sullivan’s 
          “Naming,” comes from a section of <i>In The House of the Shaman</i>, called 
          “Kinship with Animals.” Its epigraph—and indeed, the title of the volume—is 
          drawn from Joseph Beuys, the German installation and performance artist. 
          O’Sullivan describes working on the BBC Arena programme on Beuys in the 
          late eighties, appropriately, as a “transformative experience.”<a
  href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">19</a> It is no wonder that Beuys, who 
          also grappled with these tensions between a fidelity to nature amid the 
          creation of cultural artefacts, should be such an ethical figure for O’Sullivan. 
          The only way to make language shift like the lard that Beuys transformed 
          is to work with the instability within the linguistic sign, “underneath, 
          behind, with language,” as Maggie O’Sullivan says.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">20</a> 
          This materiality engenders a paradoxical freedom to transform, something 
          found in Beuys’ lard sculptures. The epigraph provides the necessary philosophic 
          stance for O’Sullivan’s balancing and fusing, even confusing, of natural 
          processes and cultural materialism: </font></p>
        <blockquote>

          not pure music, but it does not offer the certainties of denotation that 
          it might seem to promise. “Water/they unlidder” the poem begins, refusing 
          yet to name, offering a half rhyme for “water,” the element upon which 
          the poem focuses. To unlid something would be to remove its lid, to open; 
          lidder would seem to be also a noun, but operates as a verb here, and 
          makes the act of “unliddering” seem, through sound, through grammar, a 
          very deliberate one: opening the perceptive eyes perhaps as the lids part, 
          though it seems more violent, to rip the lids away for permanent seeing, 
          though it is the water’s surface the unnamed “they” peel away. (If they 
          are fish, they have no lids themselves, of course.) The water’s surface 
          is also broken by the named and noisy “scraping fowls.” </font></p>

          at a sound.”<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">23</a><sup> </sup>But 
          the Old English etymology of the word points to an act of confession, 
          the Latin to the act of writing. Together they suggest a document as a 
          testament. The bird’s natural motion becomes a cultural inscription, or 
          is seen in terms of one. Wings and pieces of paper can both be folded, 
          both are possible concealments, of that which is confessed. The scraping 
          on the water is an hieroglyphics of sorts, cut with a blade that could 
          be a fowl’s wing, hence the parts of words and dots and dashes, the disturbance 
          on water.  This act of descriptive precision is turning into a description 
          of a Maggie O’Sullivan poem, into its own material saying, the abruptness

          drove I eared” and “Ear-Loads I Sing!”<sup> <a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"
  title="">24</a></sup> Whether or not we are in the presence of a dragon’s breath, 
          there is an “ear-Load” more of transformation in the phrase or word “plum-BURR”: 
          plumage be-comes plum, cut down. Plum is a colour, BURR a sound, a choke 
          in the throat. Plum is a fruit, also, and burr, through another definition, 
          the seed case of the fruit; these connotations stress an interchangeable 
          yet changing natural environment. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          first five letters of the mysterious “plum-BURR” also spell “plumb” in 
          the sense of measuring the depth of water, whether lidded or not, which 
          the poem enacts. Be eared, the poem seems to say, to the polysemantics 
          of nature: colour and fruition; be kin to animals (because we are akin, 
          as the title of the section reminds us). But the semantics are held off 
          by the thick devicehood of the poem, its saying glorified in the act of 
          being born in our reading, and dying only slowly into the thematized fixity 
          of our interpretations, particularly as we follow words through their 
          etymologies and connotations. As a reader follows such semantic trails 
          he or she must retreat from the actual performance of the poem, a paradox 
          to which I shall return.</font></p>

          It is instructive to see how O’Sullivan herself deals with this dichotomy 
          between linguistic autonomy and reference to the natural world, in her 
          poetics essay “riverruning (realisations” which itself is a collage of 
          quotations from her own, and others’, works, and from a number of intentional 
          and autobiographical statements, in which she amplifies upon influences 
          and tensions identified earlier. On the one hand she speaks of Kurt Schwitters’ 
          “superb use of the UN—the NON and the LESS—the UNREGARDED, the found, 
          the cast-offs, the dismembered materials of culture.”<sup>24</sup> Again, 
          Hopkins provides the balance to Schwitters, since O’Sullivan speaks, in

          of the text), lead to changes in the poem’s language. Her work embodies

          text in performance is a version of shamanistic therapy, how is it administered? 
          The answer may lie in Adrian Clarke’s assertion that it is O’Sullivan’s 
          person—her body—that is transformed as she reads the texts, and in Attridge’s 
          remarks about the muscular aspects of signification.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bakhtin’s 
          early essay “Content, Material, and Form in Verbal Art,” focuses, rarely 
          for Bakhtin, upon poetry, and argues that the transformation of material 
          into architectonics, of technique into aesthetic object, and the making 
          of the poem, “allows the author-creator to become a constitutive moment 
          of form.”<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">29</a> “The feeling 
          of verbal activeness, the feeling of the active generation of signifying 
          <i>sound</i>” is the governing moment of poetry, a moment that could happen 
          on the page, (the irruption of thingness, as I call it) but I believe 
          is particularly re-created and fulfilled in performance; <a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"
  title="">30</a><sup> </sup>it is “a moment into which both the organism and meaning-directed 
          activity are drawn, because both the flesh and the spirit [the signifier 
          and the signified I take him to mean] are generated together in this concrete 
          unity.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">31</a><sup> </sup></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Theory 
          may have recently seen the re-birth of the author, but not yet, I think, 
          as performer, but Bakhtin points towards ways of achieving that: “The 
          movement that generates acoustical sound, and is most active in the articulatory 
          organs, although it takes hold of the whole organism...is incommensurably 
          more important than what is <i>heard,</i>” not in a retreat from meaning, 
          but because the poem has “taken possession of the whole active human being.”<a href="#_ftn32"
  name="_ftnref32" title="">32</a> This literal incarnation, at the moment that 
          poetic language comes into being is what O’Sullivan achieves when she 
          turns ideolect to a kind of dialect. Her “Earloads” are becoming <i>physical</i> 
          burdens, for the performer-poet, as in Bakhtin’s formulation of the lyric, 
          “when the body, generating the sound from within itself and feeling the 
          unity of its own productive exertion, is drawn into form.”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
  title="">33</a> This birth of language (a metaphor which unites nature and culture) 
          is indeed a glorification of productive exertion in the body: the word 
          made flesh. It is also the most poignant example of a saying that pre-empts 
          the power of the said. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
          believe that what the exuberance of O’Sullivan’s work—particularly its 
          sonic performance—is trying to do is to find a further productive unity: 
          one between culture and nature—to replicate the productive exertion of 
          the natural forces she celebrates. Kinship with animals implies making 
          the poem a part of organic nature, which is only possible <i>through</i> 
          sound, articulated <i>through</i> the living body of the poet, in writing, 
          but more publicly, in the dialect become sociolect of performance. The 
          performance of poetry is the “Be-coming” of the text.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          hallucinatory ideolect of the O’Sullivan performance may engender temporary 
          modalities of being, of creating, in its own way, what Felix Guattari 
          called “mutant subjectivities” for the audience, that constitute a “preliminary 
          deconstruction of the structures and codes in use and a chaosmic plunge 
          into the materials of sensation. Out of them a recomposition becomes possible,” 
          says Guattari. <a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">34</a> </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">How 
          can the ideolect-cum-dialect of any poetry performance become a shared 
          sociolect? I believe that Guattari’s reading—re-writing—of the Bakhtin 
          essay provides one theoretical answer. In <i>Chaosmosis</i> he identifies 
          Bakhtin’s sense of the verbal activity which gives autonomy to content 
          and engenders activity in the author and audience with his own notion 
          of the “ritornello” or “refrain.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
          refrain is a detached existential motif which orders chaos and assists 
          the process of subjectivation. His examples of the refrain range from 
          enabling and territorial birdsong through to the condition of an individual 
          watching the TV, where his or her subjectivity is polyphonized by existing 
          at the intersections of disparate experiences on and off the screen. The 
          refrain “acts upon that which surrounds it, sound or light, extracting 
          from its various vibrations or decompositions, projections, transformations.”<a href="#_ftn35"
  name="_ftnref35" title="">35</a> It ruptures the dominant redundancies and catalyses 
          their re-combination in a sort of multidimensional epiphany. The refrain 
          function in Maggie O’Sullivan’s text and performance is this very exuberant 
          creation of temporary dialect, or even sociolect, the sensation of linguistic 
          activity of which Bakhtin speaks, the catalysing of what feels like meaning 
          being created, doubly, through sound, through the specialized semantics 
          of neologism. Indeed, Guattari says that performance art engenders a process 
          of existential detachment and disordering which is then supplemented by 
          existential <i>recomposition</i> of the fragments for the audience.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Poetry 
          in performance, whatever its tensions, can be argued to be the production 
          of a productivity: always of machinic combinations of different elements 
          of poetic language and performance events.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">36</a> 
          Catalyzing changes in both authors and readers could potentially assist, 
          in a new aesthetic paradigm of experience, the individual and collective 
          means of producing healthily polyphonic subjectivities, capable of achieving 
          autonomy or “autopoesis,” as Guattari would say. “Thus it is not only 
          in the context of music and poetry that we see the work of such fragments 
          detached from content...the polyphony of modes of subjectivation actually 
          corresponds to a multiplicity of ways of ‘keeping time.’ Other rhythmics 
          are thus led to crystallize existential assemblages.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">37</a></font></p>

          poetry, particularly in an expanded context such as an environment or 
          an installation piece, such as that discussed by Bergvall, or cris cheek’s 
          recordings, is a machinic productivity <i>out from</i> text, <i>alongside</i> 
          texts, <i>into</i> texts, in a flexible multisystemic activity, and its 
          aims are, as Guattari would say, indeed did say, of performance art: “a 
          forward flight into machinations and deterritorialized machinic paths 
          capable of engendering mutant subjectivities...a proliferation not just 
          of forms but of modalities of being.”<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">48</a>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          theorize performance in terms of Deleuzoguattarian machinic productivity 
          suggests an irreversible, unpredictable activity, but it also avoids certain 
          ways of thinking that might prioritise combined media in a live art context, 
          or relationships between elements, or impose models of unity, such as 
          metaphors of fusion, synthesis, organic wholeness, or counterpoint. To 
          think of the elements as machines allows for the development of simultaneous, 
          asymmetric processes, of finding the work in performance, of finding unprescribed 
          relationships or even lacks of relationship. Finally this suggests both 
          the transformation of all the possible elements and their potential breakdown

          liberation of text from the page, and ever widening definitions put “performance” 
          as a term squarely at the heart of Linguistically Innovative Poetry. For 
          so long it has been assumed, particularly in the Pound-Olson tradition 
          that the supposed connection between verse and music (and dance) subsisted 
          until the Renaissance and was undone by the rise of  “print-bred poetry” 
          as Olson put it, with its practice of silent solitary reading: “What we 
          have suffered from, is manuscript, press, the removal of verse from its 
          producer and its reproducer, the voice, a removal...from its place of 
          origin <i>and</i> its destination.”<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"

          rather than lost in such developments, particularly in the ways trained 
          readers respond to the page. To use the term “audience” (rather than reader) 
          might be thought a neutral term, but to privilege the auditory to is underplay 
          other aspects of poetic artifice. For one, we need to consider, to use 
          the deceptively simple title of a recent book, “the look of it.”<a href="#_ftn50"
  name="_ftnref50" title="">50</a> Olson, of course, sang the praises of the typewriter, 
          though chiefly as a scoring device for breath performance. O’Sullivan’s 
          texts use space meticulously, not just as a score for performance—that 
          would render such meaningful artifice secondary, less meaningful—but as 
          a primary field for the play of devices. Her work is an example of what 
          Marjorie Perloff calls “the new nonlinear poetries” that have extended 
          the range of so-called free verse, which she has also argued is itself 
          primarily a visual, not a rhythmical, ordering.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">51</a>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">“Naming” 
          is a conservative, linear, poem, by O’Sullivan’s standards, though even 
          here, where the materiality of language is emphasized (those dots, dashes 
          and suffixes) the lines are indented. The “plum-BURR” repeated thrice, 
          is indented, visually isolated (as is the last line, as I have said). 
          It is as though, in order to consider the range of connotations this lexical 
          item contains, in order to open up the realm of the saying it inaugurates, 
          we must stop, or pause, the different saying of performance. The reader 
          needs to hold dialogue, to mentally scribble in the white space, to allow 
          the semantics of neologism, its avenues of connotation, to unfold.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
          Indeed, there may be aspects of sound in poetry that operate in a non-performative 
          way, or in a way that re-defines performance. The problem of my theoretical 
          use of the concepts of the saying and the said (despite my re-definitions 
          in terms of reading and the read, even naming and the named) is that saying 
          suggests oral performance while the said suggests a page-based reception 
          of text. I am aware that Bergvall’s descriptions of performance writing 
          indicate more than the verbal, but she emphasizes the textual as the starting 
          point.</font></p>

          Middleton has theorized a discrimination of “voices” in the poetic text

          sense of the author’s autopoesis, one which questions the performance 
          and the performed. There exists “an imaginary voice, a voice that was 
          launched by his [the poet’s], but one that has a distinct imprint. That 
          imaginary and unmistakeable voice is a kind of <i>endophone</i>.”<a

          ordinary conditions.”<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">53</a> 
          More importantly, while the endophone is “time-traversing” the time of 
          performance imposes limitations, supplies simplifications, along with 
          its undoubted permissions.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">54</a></font></p>

            auditory complexity which exceeds almost any audible vocalizing: the 
            latter tends to be reductive, if not falsifying, also it may straighten 
            out shocks and distortions which, to the inner ear, are part of the

          may feel ontologically represssive if the condition of saying inherent 
          in a text may only fully be realized by a reader in dialogue with the 
          text, unfolding its sounds in the variable temporalities that reading 
          and memory allow, a virtual performance of an endophone separate from 
          the actualities (however well performed) of the author’s (or other performers’) 
          exophones.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">57</a> It is when 
          the to and fro of this virtual reading, this arrest of temporal sequencing, 
          is lost that performance might be thought to remove a vital empowerment 
          of the reader. Whatever other machinic senses of catalytic change performance 
          and live art may engender, it will be a different empowerment, as I have 
          suggested above, one that might leave the potentialities of poetic artifice 
          behind. My insistence upon a poetry that foregrounds its saying as against 
          its said may be more fully present in the kinds of endophonic reading 
          proposed by Middleton, during which the visual and the aural, the performative 
          and the semantic, work together in the reader-controlled temporality of 
          reception. We need to acknowledge the private performance of the silent 
          reader, or near silent reader murmuring, opening the text to its spectral 
          saying on the saidness of the material page. Indeed, is this not another 
          site for experiencing the Deleuzzoguattarian refrain?  It is the challenge 
          for those working in performance with text—and O’Sullivan, Williamson, 
          cheek and Bergvall have been highlighted here as exemplars—to keep that 
          dialogic aspect of poetry alive, even if it no longer calls itself poetry.</font></p>

            studying texts in order to establish an ideal or finalized close reading. 
            Writing which offers a formalist plenitude of performative potential

            while acting as a saying for a performer (as Bakhtin suggests) might 
            operate as a said for the reader. The thematics in such a situation 
            may not so much be the semantics of a text, but the excess of performance 
            that thematizes itself as performance, as an event in which the audience 
            does not participate.</font></p>
