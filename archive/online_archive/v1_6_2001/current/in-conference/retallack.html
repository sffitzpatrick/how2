        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here’s 
          a coincidence. I’ve been thinking a lot about these things—coincidence, 
          surprise. The latter as a positive aesthetic value. It’s one of those 
          days composed of rushing here and there for reasons instantly erased by 
          the completion of each task. I decide to turn on my car radio just as 
          a woman’s voice is saying that complex thought in writing is always surprising. 
          Does she mean it both ways? That it’s surprising to find complex thought 
          in writing? That thought that does not surprise is not complex? We intuitively 
          know that everyday life doesn’t conform to the simple outlines of well-made 
          genres. In fact any event (and I include the acts of writing-reading, 
          performing on or off the page in this active category) is surprising largely 
          to the degree that it transgresses its own generic expectations. When 
          it really does this, going beyond the calculated surprises of an artful 
          plot, or screamingly censurable subject matter, it’s instantly recognized 
          as a crime by those who police aesthetic expectations. (This is my 37 
          second history of the avant-garde.) </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is 
          there always a coincidence in a crime? Of course, everything is, of course, 
          coincidence and yet the aesthetic event that incorporates the kinds of 
          coincidence one notices—the unsettling ones, the dissonant juxtapositions—is 
          always surprising, is always a crime unless/until those juxtapositions 
          become familiar, naturalized. Coincidence and surprise can be, though 
          not most significantly, about content; their foregrounding is more a matter 
          of what one notices when brought to a condition of exhilaratingly urgent 
          attention. If literature is an engagement with possible forms of life—as 
          all language games (written or spoken or performed) must be—there are 
          perhaps too many ways in which there is no crime, too many forms that 
          erase the urgency of wonder, bypass the most difficult questions of making 
          meaning in a world whose borders exist after all only to locate scenes 
          of transgression, a world whose increasingly self-conscious intimacy is 
          imploding with multiplicity, mongrelism, collisions of perception, intention, 
          desire. The other side of this energy, the explosion of forms that we’ve 
          seen throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century (likely to continue in this 
          one) poses difficulties for traditionalists—e.g., narrators of coherency, 
          tidy story-tellers as guardians of logics of identity and convention. 
          The narrator of continuity is (albeit often unawares) at odds in a world 
          whose vulnerabilities have more to do with contiguity. Contiguity is the 
          spatial dimension of coincidence.  It is in fact the ill-fitting coincidence-contiguity 
          of our reciprocal alterity whose energies continually disrupt longings 
          for harmony, for smooth transitions, for the grand, clean sweep of self-assured 
          narration, for the life that is the well-made story that is true to the 
          life.  </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
          make a “novel of real life”—as distinct from stylistic naturalism—it was 
          necessary to pursue language, with its internal tensions between grammatical 
          logics and radical unintelligibilities, as an active intersection that 
          resists one to one correspondence with anything other than its own traffic 
          patterns. Stein was acutely aware, as was John Cage, of the incommensurability 
          of the multiple logics we experience and employ in different parts of 
          our lives. Hence the cluster of questions that will always exist concerning 
          the connection of connections within a work of art to the connections 
          between persons and events and things in daily life. These passages from 
          Stein’s “The Superstitions Of Fred Anneday, Annday, Anday A Novel Of Real 
          Life” examine precisely the same puzzle of poetics that Aristotle and 
          countless others since have worked on—the relation between the unfolding 
          logic of a lived day and the logic of time in literature:</font></p>

            that because after all there has to be all day to be like that. And 
            all day is like that. And there cannot be a novel like that because 
            it is too confusing written down if it is like that so a novel is like

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
          course, an important characteristic of performance is that it usually 
          doesn’t happen in all-day, ordinary time. (Aristotle based an entire <i>Poetics 
          </i>on this fact.) And even if it did, it’s time could not be coterminous 
          with everyday-life time, since the framing of an event as performance 
          is in fact a kind of time-bracketing (as Cage called it) that transforms 
          the time-sense (as Stein called it) within it. Hence the inherent urgency 
          of performance is not only its ephemerality, but also the accident, coincidence, 
          contingent constructedness brought into the foreground by that bracketing. 
          That, when it works, is always surprising. The tenuous, tentative suspension 
          of disbelief of an audience is always on the verge of betrayal. Yet as 
          one is initiated into the logics of and by the event itself, one also 
          feels less and less that it is arbitrary. <i>Contingent but not arbitrary</i> 
          is not a paradox it is a condition of life principles that have to do 
          with the complex interactions and interpermeabilities that constitute 
          any event in the world. What is most likely to be read as arbitrary is 
          a surprising interrelationship since the sense of necessity is entirely 
          dependent on knowing that familiar principles or logical rules have been 
          properly followed. Hence, not the arbitrary, not nonsense, but new sense—and 
          the urgency of trying to make meaning of that new sense is another source 
          of excitement in work performing in unfamiliar or very complex logical 
          space-time. Logical space-time? This site invokes:</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          set of conditions is applicable to bodies in live performance as well 
          as to difficult texts. This is one reason why complex historical texts 
          like Shakespeare’s or the Bible or even <i>Ulysses </i>or <i>Finnigans 
          Wake</i> continue to fascinate, particularly in performance—e.g., those 
          marathon readings of the latter. High levels of residual unintelligibility 
          within the certified meaningfulness of a classic within a public context 
          of even implicit construction of meaning summon a-e with minimized anxiety. 
          The payoff will be real; the struggle is admirable when the work is a 
          classic. That one can make only fleeting meaning no matter how intense 
          one’s engagement is something we learn in our encounters with complex 
          work from distant cultural space-time but, sadly, don’t tend to apply 
          to contemporary work that is equally distant for different reasons or 
          perhaps reasons of an interesting symmetry: the very old and the very 
          new are similarly indeterminate. The former has a dissonance from having 
          drifted away from habits of mind, the latter from just beginning to challenge 
          them.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>          
          </span>Fleeting meaning is an obvious property of events unfolding in 
          time, absent text or instant replay. The requirement of intensely alert 
          attention of the sort that must make something of what is happening “before 
          one’s eyes”—text or no text—makes us feel acutely what is more often a 
          chronic condition—the piquant fact of being alive. The coincidence, the 
          surprise of being alive, sensed not necessarily in these terms, but in 
          an excitement cresting in every cell of one’s body. Needless to say this 
          doesn’t happen in the presence of every performance, every text. To feel, 
          for instance, as acutely alive as some do in the critical time-bracket 
          constructed by placing a bet, anticipating news of the outcome at a roulette 
          table or the races (some have argued that the addiction to gambling is 
          about just this) the performance must have an urgency on which all—for 
          the moment—depends. But what can that possibly mean in the realm of aesthetics?  
          I have no answer, just some tangential thoughts in the form of a puzzle: 
          The poethical wager of performing or attending to (as audience) an engagement 
          with the vivid distance of the hyper-textual/hyper-real is an extreme 
          sport.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>          
          </span>Some differences need to be marked. There is of course the extreme 
          sport of everyday life, thank god, generally not recognized as such. There 
          is also the extreme sport of what have to their detriment been known as 
          the high arts. This is problematic if “high” is related to class; should 
          not be problematic if “high” is related to “wire.” The best of the high 
          wire arts require daring all around. One has to train for this in order 
          to not burn out. This is a matter of highly charged <i>poesis</i> (making), 
          not entertainment. This is very much about how one experiences a transformation 
          of one’s sense of time and one’s role in making sense of what is happening—in 
          frame of the event in the world as one experiences oneself an active part 
          of this developing “it.” “It,” therefore, does not apply to the sur-real, 
          which is something else entirely, what Gertrude Stein categorizes as dream 
          time (a disengagement from the urgency of everyday life) and finds of 
          no interest for her work. Dream time has an animal magnetism that collapses 
          aesthetic distance.</font></p>

          </span>CASE STUDY: A German husband-wife team of architects are presenting 
          their very evocative postmodern projects of cultural memory. How do you 
          memorize (sic) historical catastrophes when our visual habits have changed 
          so radically? she asks. Pictures are always in motion. We have to be in 
          motion too. (In one of their projects they brilliantly answer the U.S. 
          Congressional Librarian’s lament that we have become motion without memory. 
          They have installed a decentralized holocaust memorial in Berlin. Images 
          turn up as you round a corner or cross a street.) We (the audience) are 
          seated in the raked auditorium of the Art History room at Bard College 
          (north of NYC). They are on a stage, using a podium, being taped, showing 
          slides. To put it succinctly, they get into a running argument (i.e., 
          a fight) with each other that is edging into everything they do. Several 
          in the audience are whispering, Is this a performance? The talk goes on 
          in English, but with all of the slides showing German signs and posters, 
          some one asks for translation.  “Bank, which means Bank,” she says. Is 
          this a performance? The word TERROR appears on the screen. Is this like 
          Bank? Has that word come into the German language? Why not <i>Schrecken</i>? 
          Anxiety has permeated the room. No one dares ask anything more. “This 
          area formerly with a large Jewish population.” “In this photo you see 
          one of those problematic social moments.” (Elderly woman seated on one 
          bench, man sleeping on another bench.) Why is this problematic? What’s 
          going on?  Why has the question of performance/not performance, speaker 
          v. performer become so important?  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>      
          </span>    I won’t attempt to supply an answer, but I think this question 
          points to critical issues of the performative vs. the real (no problem 
          with the true at this juncture). I am reminded of Blanchot’s mini-aphorism: 
          “Seeing implies distance.” The converse is of course true as well. One 
          needs distance to see, to register certain kinds of things acutely. Our 
          visceral contiguity with the real doesn’t allow that. Anxiety is visceral. 
          To be anxious about the real state of their marriage, or whether they 
          have a degree of scorn for their audience, or about a level of sophistication 
          or subtlety one might not be getting, is to lose aesthetic distance. This 
          is why audience participation (or assault) as theater never works as theater. 
          The hyperreal that shimmers just because it is securely framed sometimes 
          does work. This is the frame of the aesthetic wager. It is captioned thus: 
          you are embarked; this is your extraordinary form of life for the space-time 
          of the voyage; the voyage is the navigation of the shimmer; you needn’t 
          worry about a thing; you may enjoy the illusion of infinite time… </font></p>

          John Cage’s work was based on live performance and yet all over the world 
          his presence as Epicurean swerve (Lucretian clinamen) was probably most 
          often effected through the book <i>Silence</i>. <i>Silence </i>was experienced 
          as an urgent text. In Leningrad it was translated and passed around among 
          artists underground. Any banned document takes on urgency since it’s banning 
          gives it the property of being an <i>other</i> possible world. That sense 
          of heightened possibility reconfigures the geometry of attention. In the 
          foreground is the language that is normally invisible, inaudible, unintelligible. 
          It’s a radical coincidence that one can attend to other possibilities 
          at all—outside the suffocation of official logics. It’s a matter, not 
          of fact, not of institutions, but of happenstance—whom  you happen to 
          know. That someone happened to come across <i>Silence. </i> “Do you see, 
          nothing is surprising but a coincidence. A fact is not surprising, a coincidence 
          is surprising and that is the reason that crime is surprising. There is 
          always a coincidence in a crime. There are so many ways in which there 
          is no crime.”  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">         
          A crime in Leningrad but also in other cultural preserves just because 
          the unintelligibility to officialdom or to familiar preconceptions is 
          what creates the occasion for a making of new meaning. The audience is 
          invited to participate in the making of new intelligibility, that is, 
          a new form of life. This need not be a major revolution—just a swerve 
          of thought toward a use of history that enables a vital invention of self 
          in the reciprocal alterity of the contemporary moment. This takes perspective 
          and humor that can accommodate the terror (that means terror) and delight 
          (that means something less certain) of our historical contemporary. It 
          can happen in the performance of the writing on the page, e.g., in “Lecture 
          on Nothing” in <i>Silence.</i> Or in dense texts that suggest permutative 
          semantics, grammars, logics. Cage likened this state to that of being 
          a tourist in everyday life. Stein likened it to being a foreigner (same 
          thing?) —the foreigner that every contemporary artist must be. Stein: 
          “Oh dear a foreigner. They did not listen to him be a foreigner”(<i>Blood 
          on the Dining Room Floor</i>). It’s a poethos of contemporaneity that 
          Stein articulates in her 1935 essay “How Writing is Written,” </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Everybody 
            is contemporary with his [sic] period...and the whole business of writing 
            is the question of living in that contemporariness...The thing that 
            is important is that nobody knows what the contemporariness is. In other 
            words, they don’t know where they are going, but they are on their way.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>4</span></a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">That 
          articulates what should be the spirit of every performance—you don’t know 
          where it’s going but you know its on the way. Hence,</font></p>

          </span>Poetry that performs on the page, as this does, should be performed 
          off the page as well. All of Stein’s work happens to lend itself to this, 
          not just the operas and plays. It does because it is work that retains 
          its foregrounding of contingency precisely in its refusal to repair—to 
          repair itself, to repair to something other than itself while asserting 
          the specifics of its own lucidity. This presents the sort of occasion 
          that performance is meant to rise to, yes/no?—a spacio-temporal articulation 
          of fleeting lucidity.</font></p>
