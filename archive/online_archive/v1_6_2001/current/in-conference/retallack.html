      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here’s 
        a coincidence. I’ve been thinking a lot about these things—coincidence, 
        surprise. The latter as a positive aesthetic value. It’s one of those 
        days composed of rushing here and there for reasons instantly erased by 
        the completion of each task. I decide to turn on my car radio just as 
        a woman’s voice is saying that complex thought in writing is always surprising. 
        Does she mean it both ways? That it’s surprising to find complex thought 
        in writing? That thought that does not surprise is not complex? We intuitively 
        know that everyday life doesn’t conform to the simple outlines of well-made 
        genres. In fact any event (and I include the acts of writing-reading, 
        performing on or off the page in this active category) is surprising largely 
        to the degree that it transgresses its own generic expectations. When 
        it really does this, going beyond the calculated surprises of an artful 
        plot, or screamingly censurable subject matter, it’s instantly recognized 
        as a crime by those who police aesthetic expectations. (This is my 37 
        second history of the avant-garde.) </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is 
        there always a coincidence in a crime? Of course, everything is, of course, 
        coincidence and yet the aesthetic event that incorporates the kinds of 
        coincidence one notices—the unsettling ones, the dissonant juxtapositions—is 
        always surprising, is always a crime unless/until those juxtapositions 
        become familiar, naturalized. Coincidence and surprise can be, though 
        not most significantly, about content; their foregrounding is more a matter 
        of what one notices when brought to a condition of exhilaratingly urgent 
        attention. If literature is an engagement with possible forms of life—as 
        all language games (written or spoken or performed) must be—there are 
        perhaps too many ways in which there is no crime, too many forms that 
        erase the urgency of wonder, bypass the most difficult questions of making 
        meaning in a world whose borders exist after all only to locate scenes 
        of transgression, a world whose increasingly self-conscious intimacy is 
        imploding with multiplicity, mongrelism, collisions of perception, intention, 
        desire. The other side of this energy, the explosion of forms that we’ve 
        seen throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century (likely to continue in this 
        one) poses difficulties for traditionalists—e.g., narrators of coherency, 
        tidy story-tellers as guardians of logics of identity and convention. 
        The narrator of continuity is (albeit often unawares) at odds in a world 
        whose vulnerabilities have more to do with contiguity. Contiguity is the 
        spatial dimension of coincidence.  It is in fact the ill-fitting coincidence-contiguity 
        of our reciprocal alterity whose energies continually disrupt longings 
        for harmony, for smooth transitions, for the grand, clean sweep of self-assured 
        narration, for the life that is the well-made story that is true to the 
        life.  </font></p>

        equivalence doesn’t work could come as a surprise only in the context 
        of literary institutions that have a constituent need to erase difficulty, 
        most notably the literary market place. But, wait, this is beginning to 
        look suspiciously like a story—story of early, middle or late capitalism 
        reinscribing its brutally fetishized commodification and reification of—If 
        I don’t stop it right here and now it might prematurely ejaculate its 
        own conclusion. Stein stops me. Stein writes in her seven page, four chapter

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        make a “novel of real life”—as distinct from stylistic naturalism—it was 
        necessary to pursue language, with its internal tensions between grammatical 
        logics and radical unintelligibilities, as an active intersection that 
        resists one to one correspondence with anything other than its own traffic 
        patterns. Stein was acutely aware, as was John Cage, of the incommensurability 
        of the multiple logics we experience and employ in different parts of 
        our lives. Hence the cluster of questions that will always exist concerning 
        the connection of connections within a work of art to the connections 
        between persons and events and things in daily life. These passages from 
        Stein’s “The Superstitions Of Fred Anneday, Annday, Anday A Novel Of Real 
        Life” examine precisely the same puzzle of poetics that Aristotle and 
        countless others since have worked on—the relation between the unfolding 
        logic of a lived day and the logic of time in literature:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
          is not at all confusing to live every day and to meet everyone not at 
          all confusing but to tell any one yes it is confusing even if only telling 
          it to any one how you lived any one day and met everybody all of that 
          day. And now what more can one do than that. And doing more than that

          to say farewell. But he never did. Fred Anday never said farewell to 
          any one in a day no one ever does because every one sees every one every 
          day which is a natural way for a day to be….Of course no dream is like 
          that because after all there has to be all day to be like that. And 
          all day is like that. And there cannot be a novel like that because 
          it is too confusing written down if it is like that so a novel is like 
          a dream when it is not like that.<br>

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
        course, an important characteristic of performance is that it usually 
        doesn’t happen in all-day, ordinary time. (Aristotle based an entire <i>Poetics 
        </i>on this fact.) And even if it did, it’s time could not be coterminous 
        with everyday-life time, since the framing of an event as performance 
        is in fact a kind of time-bracketing (as Cage called it) that transforms 
        the time-sense (as Stein called it) within it. Hence the inherent urgency 
        of performance is not only its ephemerality, but also the accident, coincidence, 
        contingent constructedness brought into the foreground by that bracketing. 
        That, when it works, is always surprising. The tenuous, tentative suspension 
        of disbelief of an audience is always on the verge of betrayal. Yet as 
        one is initiated into the logics of and by the event itself, one also 
        feels less and less that it is arbitrary. <i>Contingent but not arbitrary</i> 
        is not a paradox it is a condition of life principles that have to do 
        with the complex interactions and interpermeabilities that constitute 
        any event in the world. What is most likely to be read as arbitrary is 
        a surprising interrelationship since the sense of necessity is entirely 
        dependent on knowing that familiar principles or logical rules have been 
        properly followed. Hence, not the arbitrary, not nonsense, but new sense—and 
        the urgency of trying to make meaning of that new sense is another source 
        of excitement in work performing in unfamiliar or very complex logical 
        space-time. Logical space-time? This site invokes:</font></p>

        </span>       e) The surprise of constant coincidence.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        set of conditions is applicable to bodies in live performance as well 
        as to difficult texts. This is one reason why complex historical texts 
        like Shakespeare’s or the Bible or even <i>Ulysses </i>or <i>Finnigans 
        Wake</i> continue to fascinate, particularly in performance—e.g., those 
        marathon readings of the latter. High levels of residual unintelligibility 
        within the certified meaningfulness of a classic within a public context 
        of even implicit construction of meaning summon a-e with minimized anxiety. 
        The payoff will be real; the struggle is admirable when the work is a 
        classic. That one can make only fleeting meaning no matter how intense 
        one’s engagement is something we learn in our encounters with complex 
        work from distant cultural space-time but, sadly, don’t tend to apply 
        to contemporary work that is equally distant for different reasons or 
        perhaps reasons of an interesting symmetry: the very old and the very 
        new are similarly indeterminate. The former has a dissonance from having 
        drifted away from habits of mind, the latter from just beginning to challenge 
        them.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>          
        </span>Fleeting meaning is an obvious property of events unfolding in 
        time, absent text or instant replay. The requirement of intensely alert 
        attention of the sort that must make something of what is happening “before 
        one’s eyes”—text or no text—makes us feel acutely what is more often a 
        chronic condition—the piquant fact of being alive. The coincidence, the 
        surprise of being alive, sensed not necessarily in these terms, but in 
        an excitement cresting in every cell of one’s body. Needless to say this 
        doesn’t happen in the presence of every performance, every text. To feel, 
        for instance, as acutely alive as some do in the critical time-bracket 
        constructed by placing a bet, anticipating news of the outcome at a roulette 
        table or the races (some have argued that the addiction to gambling is 
        about just this) the performance must have an urgency on which all—for 
        the moment—depends. But what can that possibly mean in the realm of aesthetics?  
        I have no answer, just some tangential thoughts in the form of a puzzle: 
        The poethical wager of performing or attending to (as audience) an engagement 
        with the vivid distance of the hyper-textual/hyper-real is an extreme 
        sport.  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>          
        </span>Some differences need to be marked. There is of course the extreme 
        sport of everyday life, thank god, generally not recognized as such. There 
        is also the extreme sport of what have to their detriment been known as 
        the high arts. This is problematic if “high” is related to class; should 
        not be problematic if “high” is related to “wire.” The best of the high 
        wire arts require daring all around. One has to train for this in order 
        to not burn out. This is a matter of highly charged <i>poesis</i> (making), 
        not entertainment. This is very much about how one experiences a transformation 
        of one’s sense of time and one’s role in making sense of what is happening—in 
        frame of the event in the world as one experiences oneself an active part 
        of this developing “it.” “It,” therefore, does not apply to the sur-real, 
        which is something else entirely, what Gertrude Stein categorizes as dream 
        time (a disengagement from the urgency of everyday life) and finds of 
        no interest for her work. Dream time has an animal magnetism that collapses 
        aesthetic distance.</font></p>

        </span>CASE STUDY: A German husband-wife team of architects are presenting 
        their very evocative postmodern projects of cultural memory. How do you 
        memorize (sic) historical catastrophes when our visual habits have changed 
        so radically? she asks. Pictures are always in motion. We have to be in 
        motion too. (In one of their projects they brilliantly answer the U.S. 
        Congressional Librarian’s lament that we have become motion without memory. 
        They have installed a decentralized holocaust memorial in Berlin. Images 
        turn up as you round a corner or cross a street.) We (the audience) are 
        seated in the raked auditorium of the Art History room at Bard College 
        (north of NYC). They are on a stage, using a podium, being taped, showing 
        slides. To put it succinctly, they get into a running argument (i.e., 
        a fight) with each other that is edging into everything they do. Several 
        in the audience are whispering, Is this a performance? The talk goes on 
        in English, but with all of the slides showing German signs and posters, 
        some one asks for translation.  “Bank, which means Bank,” she says. Is 
        this a performance? The word TERROR appears on the screen. Is this like 
        Bank? Has that word come into the German language? Why not <i>Schrecken</i>? 
        Anxiety has permeated the room. No one dares ask anything more. “This 
        area formerly with a large Jewish population.” “In this photo you see 
        one of those problematic social moments.” (Elderly woman seated on one 
        bench, man sleeping on another bench.) Why is this problematic? What’s 
        going on?  Why has the question of performance/not performance, speaker 
        v. performer become so important?  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>      
        </span>    I won’t attempt to supply an answer, but I think this question 
        points to critical issues of the performative vs. the real (no problem 
        with the true at this juncture). I am reminded of Blanchot’s mini-aphorism: 
        “Seeing implies distance.” The converse is of course true as well. One 
        needs distance to see, to register certain kinds of things acutely. Our 
        visceral contiguity with the real doesn’t allow that. Anxiety is visceral. 
        To be anxious about the real state of their marriage, or whether they 
        have a degree of scorn for their audience, or about a level of sophistication 
        or subtlety one might not be getting, is to lose aesthetic distance. This 
        is why audience participation (or assault) as theater never works as theater. 
        The hyperreal that shimmers just because it is securely framed sometimes 
        does work. This is the frame of the aesthetic wager. It is captioned thus: 
        you are embarked; this is your extraordinary form of life for the space-time 
        of the voyage; the voyage is the navigation of the shimmer; you needn’t

        John Cage’s work was based on live performance and yet all over the world 
        his presence as Epicurean swerve (Lucretian clinamen) was probably most 
        often effected through the book <i>Silence</i>. <i>Silence </i>was experienced 
        as an urgent text. In Leningrad it was translated and passed around among 
        artists underground. Any banned document takes on urgency since it’s banning 
        gives it the property of being an <i>other</i> possible world. That sense 
        of heightened possibility reconfigures the geometry of attention. In the 
        foreground is the language that is normally invisible, inaudible, unintelligible. 
        It’s a radical coincidence that one can attend to other possibilities 
        at all—outside the suffocation of official logics. It’s a matter, not 
        of fact, not of institutions, but of happenstance—whom  you happen to 
        know. That someone happened to come across <i>Silence. </i> “Do you see, 
        nothing is surprising but a coincidence. A fact is not surprising, a coincidence 
        is surprising and that is the reason that crime is surprising. There is 
        always a coincidence in a crime. There are so many ways in which there 
        is no crime.”  </font></p>

        A crime in Leningrad but also in other cultural preserves just because 
        the unintelligibility to officialdom or to familiar preconceptions is 
        what creates the occasion for a making of new meaning. The audience is 
        invited to participate in the making of new intelligibility, that is, 
        a new form of life. This need not be a major revolution—just a swerve 
        of thought toward a use of history that enables a vital invention of self 
        in the reciprocal alterity of the contemporary moment. This takes perspective 
        and humor that can accommodate the terror (that means terror) and delight 
        (that means something less certain) of our historical contemporary. It 
        can happen in the performance of the writing on the page, e.g., in “Lecture 
        on Nothing” in <i>Silence.</i> Or in dense texts that suggest permutative 
        semantics, grammars, logics. Cage likened this state to that of being 
        a tourist in everyday life. Stein likened it to being a foreigner (same 
        thing?) —the foreigner that every contemporary artist must be. Stein: 
        “Oh dear a foreigner. They did not listen to him be a foreigner”(<i>Blood 
        on the Dining Room Floor</i>). It’s a poethos of contemporaneity that 
        Stein articulates in her 1935 essay “How Writing is Written,” </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Everybody 
          is contemporary with his [sic] period...and the whole business of writing 
          is the question of living in that contemporariness...The thing that 
          is important is that nobody knows what the contemporariness is. In other 
          words, they don’t know where they are going, but they are on their way.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>4</span></a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">That 
        articulates what should be the spirit of every performance—you don’t know 
        where it’s going but you know its on the way. Hence,</font></p>

        </span>Poetry that performs on the page, as this does, should be performed 
        off the page as well. All of Stein’s work happens to lend itself to this, 
        not just the operas and plays. It does because it is work that retains 
        its foregrounding of contingency precisely in its refusal to repair—to 
        repair itself, to repair to something other than itself while asserting 
        the specifics of its own lucidity. This presents the sort of occasion 
        that performance is meant to rise to, yes/no?—a spacio-temporal articulation 
        of fleeting lucidity.</font></p>
