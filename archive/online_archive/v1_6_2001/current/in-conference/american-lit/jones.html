                remarks capture the gist of a number of the reviews of Emmy award-winner 
                Paul Devlin’s documentary film <i>SlamNation</i>.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> 
                Devlin’s film covers the 1996 National Poetry Slam in Portland Oregon, 
                mixing scenes of live performances of the competing poets with interviews 
                from these same participants. In a poetry slam, judges (in most cases) 
                randomly chosen from the audience, score poets on a scale from one to 
                ten. The poet, or team of poets, with the highest score at the end of 
                a series of elimination rounds, “wins.” The audience participation and 
                democratic nature of the event have helped to foster the popularity of 
                “slam” poetry nationwide.<a
        href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Yet it is precisely this audience-driven 
                format of slams—in which showmanship, charisma, and theatricality of performance 
                seems to count just as much as the artistic merit of the poems presented—that 
                has fueled critical skepticism over whether the “poems” performed within 
                a slam environment count as literature.</span></font></p>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate 
                over whether the slam poetry movement fosters a “return to verse’s classical 
                roots as an improvisational, often competitive oral art form,” as some 
                would claim, or is indicative of “barbarians at the gate of high art” 
                as others assert, boils down to a question that is continually asked about 
                the art present in these competitions: <b>“But is it really poetry?” </b>My 
                response to such a question is two fold: First, I suggest that we consider 
                what definition of “poetry” bolsters such a question.  Does the quibble 
                over the literary limitations of the verbal art present in the slams represent 
                a critical ambivalence over the status of public readings or performance 
                within the terrain of poetry? Does the inquiry into its generic boundaries 
                indicate an uncertainty over the space for what is now called the “sport 
                of the spoken word”? Ironically, it might signify a discomfort with the 
                status of poetry inherent in the slams as “muscular verbal sport”<a
        href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>—as <i>conspicuous</i> public competition—versus 
                the equally (if not more so) competitive yet discrete vying for literary 
                prizes, publication opportunities in prestigious poetry journals, admission 
                to Masters in Fine Arts programs, and teaching positions in creative writing 
                departments at universities.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span>[4]</span></a></span>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>My secondary response urges me to ask: But is it really 
                new? The poet and critic Kalamu ya Salaam observes that “the first African-American 
                to publish a book in America, George Moses Horton” (who in 1829 published 
                <i>The Hope of Liberty</i>) “dictated his early poetry.” Thus, Salaam 
                suggests that “the first black poet to publish a book manufactured on 
                American soil was both literally and figuratively a spoken word poet.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> 
                It may seem anachronistic to begin my talk for a panel examining “New 
                Poetry” by highlighting Morton’s historical precedence in the art of spoken 
                word. However, my purpose today is not to reach back in time chronologically, 
                but <i>across</i> time, horizontally, to bring together three African-American 
                women poets who worry the boundaries drawn between the spoken and the 
                written word in their work. </span></font></p>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, 
                I will be imagining a community that links one of the stars of the film 
                <i>SlamNation</i>, Jessica Care Moore, with—our poet in residence at today’s 
                panel—Harryette Mullen, and with the poet and playwright Elizabeth Alexander. 
                Moore and Alexander easily qualify under the rubric of “New Poets” since 
                their work has emerged on the scene within the last five to ten years. 
                Considering that nearly two decades ago poems by Mullen were appearing 
                in the journal <i>Callaloo</i>, matching Mullen with these two writers 
                might seem a bit of a stretch. Yet, in an interview addressing the “Situation 
                of American Writing in the 1990’s,” the poet Michael Harper rightfully 
                asserts that in order for the future of American writing to flourish, 
                editors and critics must be willing to stick with authors over the duration 
                of their <i>entire</i> career.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> 
                </span> </font>
              <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying 
                this critical principle to Mullen’s corpus, for example, enables one to 
                view the evolution of her poetic form. Distinct variation exists between 
                the singular lyric subjectivity and fairly straightforward narrative found 
                in early <i>Callaloo</i> poems such as “Fable”<a href="#_edn7"
        name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> or in her book, <i>Tree Tall Woman</i> (1981), 
                and the more formally innovative, non-linear and associative morphemic 
                play present in <i>S*PeRM**K*T</i> (1992) and <i>Muse and Drudge</i> (1995). 
                Thus, it is because I want to explore the work of “new poets” <i>and</i> 
                new poetic developments by previously established writers that I place 
                Mullen along with Moore and Alexander in my literary community.</span>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
                will focus on three principle threads that connect Moore, Mullen and Alexander: 
                1) the visible influence of African-American musical forms on the composition 
                and structure of their poems, 2) the transformative pairing of colloquial 
                and highly literary references in poetic language, and 3) the figure of 
                the poet as both muse and musician. While their thematic links are of 
                significant interest, it is precisely because of their divergent <i>formal</i> 
                approaches to the merging of music and poetry that I am interested in 
                comparing their poems. Too often, poetry by writers of color is treated 
                as a paraphraseable socio-political or racial-cultural statement instead 
                of as carefully crafted verse.<b> </b>In the case of slam poetry, the 
                argument is that such composition-performances don’t <i>merit</i> treatment 
                as craft or as “verse.” As Maria Damon observes in an essay examining 
                “Poetry (n) the Public Spear: Slams, Open Readings and Dissident Traditions,” 
                poetry slams “have been accused of sanctioning mediocrity—that is, doggerel...It 
                is assumed, both in traditional critical circles and also among the experimentalists 
                that poetry that reaches for a wider field of conversants or emphasizes 
                values other than craft and subjectivity necessarily suffers a diminution 
                in subtlety and sophistication.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"
        title="">[8]</a>Jessica Care Moore’s spoken-word oriented poetry, I contend, disabuses 
                the reader-listener of this assumption.</span></font></p>

                presence as one of the star cast in <i>SlamNation</i>’s documentary of 
                the sport of spoken word should come as no surprise. She is no stranger 
                to public competition, her claim to fame includes five consecutive wins 
                at <i>Amateur Night at the Apollo</i>. A quick review of one of Moore’s 
                compositions suggests (Apollo wins notwithstanding) that she’s no <i>amateur</i>.<i> 
                </i>I’ll start by reading an excerpt from Moore’s book, <i>The Words Don’t 
                Fit In My Mouth</i> (1997). The poem is wryly entitled: “My caged bird

                As my recital of Moore’s poem might illustrate, in terms of structure 
                and form, Moore’s composition is written to be read aloud and <i>heard</i>. 
                Often slant or near rhyme pairs such “across/Lost” and “Gilligan/steal 
                again” are more clearly and effectively realized through pronunciation, 
                timing of oral delivery and cadence. I should add that they are intended 
                to be heard <i>with musical accompaniment</i>. Moore’s recent performance 
                of “My Caged Bird” on the <i>Eargasm: Crucial Poetics </i>compilation 
                album included a hip-hop derived percussive backbeat tailored to accentuate 
                Moore’s own reading rhythm. Most tellingly, Moore’s reading/performance 
                features the vocalist Blue (Alicia Renée) interspersing a variegated reiteration 
                of a chorus from the poem’s opening lines: “I know why the caged bird 
                don’t sing...cause they took away our music.”<i> <a

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>Moore transforms the blood and bars imagery in Dunbar’s

                pod zoo/And all the walls were white/Typical African bird plight”—for 
                Africans’ enslavement in America. Dunbar’s caged bird’s carol is a plaintive 
                prayer. In contrast, Moore’s bird does not engage in <i>deifi</i>cation 
                but <i>defe</i>cation. Halfway through the poem, the lines “Clawed feet/leaving 
                droppings on cross burners/Wearing sheets” point to Moore’s use of metonymy 
                and synecdoche—the cross and sheets evoke imagery associated with the 
                Klu Klux Klan—to represent the bird’s metaphorical response to racial 
                oppression. Moore’s trapped fowl also engages in a gendered act of resistance:</span>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>Here, the bird’s ability to produce music is allied with 
                her capacity to reproduce. Throughout the poem, Moore associatively links 
                the inequitable commodification of Black music to the unjust commodification 
                of Black bodies. In the face of slavery, the bird, if you will allow the 
                pun, will not lay the <i>ebony</i> egg—she refuses to “make babies come” 
                into a life of enforced labor for unpaid wages. Thus it is not just that 
                Moore’s “caged bird <i>don’t</i> sing” but that it <i>won’t</i> sing.</span></font></p>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to 
                time constraints, I will not be able to gloss all of the literary allusions 
                in Moore’s “My Caged Bird.” My point here is to illustrate that (Roger 
                Ebert’s aforementioned remarks to the contrary) spoken-word oriented poetry 
                can be a “performance art” as well as a “literary” one. I should add that, 
                in addition to her performances within a spoken-word and hip-hop musico-poetic 
                milieu, Moore has also worked in a jazz idiom as well. She recorded her 
                poem “The Word’s Don’t Fit In My Mouth” to jazz accompaniment on the jazz 
                composer and saxophonist Antonio Hart’s recent release on Verve Records 
                <i>Here I Stand</i>.The diversity of Moore’s collaborative performances 
                with musicians seems apt. In the poem, her caged bird also performs in 
                different musical genres. This canary is a multi-instrumentalist that 
                can “sing Negro spirituals,” play a heart flute in one breath and the 
                village blues on the harmonica in the next or become a human beat box 
                that “bellows beats quite lyrical.” For Moore, the caged bird—metaphorically 
                at least—is free to be “<i>every</i> woman;” she is lyricist <i>and</i> 
                versifier, musician and muse.</span></font></p>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'> In a related vein, Harryette Mullen envisions the poet 
                as a performer, as a blues and jazz vocalist in her book length poem, 
                <i>Muse &amp; Drudge</i>. Mullen notes in an interview that she began 
                the poem with a linguistic play on familiar blues subjects and phrases 
                such as “you’ve had my thrills/a reefer a tub of gin/don’t mess with me 
                I’m evil/I’m in your sin” in order to situate the poem in relationship

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In four 
                brief lines Mullen weaves together the tradition of classical poetry, 
                blues-based jazz lyrics and composition and improvisation. “Sapphire’s 
                lyre” explicitly names the African-American poet and novelist “Sapphire” 
                while playing on the “lyre” as the etymological root for the word “lyric.” 
                This resonates with the ancient idea of the poet as a lyricist. One hears 
                the name for the ancient Greek poet “Sappho” embedded in “Sapphire.” Adjoining 
                “Sapphire” to the word “lyre” directs the reader to this indirect reference 
                since the “lyre” is a “harplike musical instrument of ancient Greece, 
                used for accompanying the voice in singing and recitation.”<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> 
                The addition of the word “styles“ is also multiply resonant since “the 
                word <i>stylos</i> named the writer’s instrument for scratching words 
                onto the wax tablets the ancient Greeks used instead of paper. Thus the 
                modern word <i>style</i> indicates the personal mark of the artist.”<a
        href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> The unique vocal stylization 
                and improvisation of standard blues and jazz lyrics was the personal hallmark 
                of singers such as Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday’s musical power and 
                skill. Consequently, the phrase “Sapphire’s lyre styles” loosely converted 
                reads “Sapphire styles lyr-ics.” Mullen’s remark that she thought of <i>Muse 
                and Drudge</i> “as the place where Sappho meets the blues at the crossroads”<a href="#_edn20"
        name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a> then becomes Sapphire and sings the blues” 
                affirms this reading.</span> </font>
              <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be 
                noted that Sapphire sings both blues <i>and</i> jazz lyrics, since the 
                last line in the quatrain, “whose lives are lonely too,” is a direct quote 
                from the last verse of “Lush Life,” a jazz standard. Therefore, Mullen’s 
                stated link to the blues tradition through her poem can be extended to 
                the jazz tradition as well. This is apt, since she described her writing 
                technique and style as being modeled on both blues and jazz performances. 
                Mullen explains that <i>Muse &amp; Drudge</i> was: </span></font></p>

                    because blues verses are actually shuffled and rearranged by the performer,

                    material in different orders. Quatrains can be free standing and shuffled 
                    in and out of the work in the way that blues verses are shuffled in 
                    and out in any particular performance—that is one way the echo of 
                    the blues enters the structure of the poem.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a></span>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mullen also mentioned that “hypertext virtual shuffling” 
                could be a suitable “technological metaphor” for her composition of the 
                poem, suggesting that if <i>Muse &amp; Drudge</i> is a blues poem, it 
                is a <i>post-modern</i> blues.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> 
                None of the quatrains in the book have titles, nor do they appear to have 
                one single progressive “arc of development” from book’s beginning to end. 
                The hybrid blending of diverse resources present within a single quatrain 
                such as “muse of the world picks/out stark melodies/her raspy fabric/tickling 
                the ebonies” suggests that both the quatrains and individual lines can 
                be shuffled and twisted around.<a href="#_edn23"
        name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> Each densely allusive line can stand alone, 
                none builds towards a unified, paraphraseable statement or moves from 
                statement to resolution. Unlike Langston Hughes, Sterling Brown, or more 
                recently, Sterling Plump, Mullen expands the definition of “blues poetry” 
                to include work that is neither mimetically structured on the traditional 
                AAB or AABA form of many blues lyrics nor a transparent transcription 
                of blues vernacularisms.<i> </i>Instead<i>,</i> Mullen’s novel compositional 
                approach reveals her interest in aspects of the blues and oral tradition 
                “that are enigmatic and cryptic formulations, open to various interpretations.”<a href="#_edn24"
        name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> It is this “essence of enigma” which characterizes 
                the complicated wordplay in <i>Muse &amp; Drudge</i> that reveals its 
                roots in jazz. “Mysterious,” Mullen notes, according to Clarence Major 
                in <i>Juba to Jive: a Dictionary of African-American Slang</i>, refers 
                to the “avant-garde musical tradition, something that’s way out.”<a href="#_edn25"
        name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> In terms of tradition, Mullen claims she “associated 
                the avant-garde or innovative aspects of [her poem] with jazz musicians, 
                particularly people like Thelonious Monk, as in “solo mysterioso.”<a
        href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> She also likened the phonemic 
                games many of her verses engage in to scat singing. Mullen’s remarks concerning 
                this aspect of her feminist avant-garde poetics is particularly revealing. 
                It counters the critical tendency to read the innovative formal characteristics 
                of her work as being essentially derived from European-American modernists 
                such as Gertrude Stein and the more ostensibly opaque, or transparently 
                vernacular, aspects of her writing as being socio-culturally rooted in 
                African-American authors such as Zora Neale Hurston.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> 
                I would argue that Mullen’s remarks concerning her concepts and strategies 
                for composition indicate that in terms of content and form <i>Muse &amp; 
                Drudge</i> is effectively styled as a hybrid blues/jazz poem. </span>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
                jazz influenced poetry is compared to poetic forms influenced by the blues, 
                the label “formless” is proffered as a compliment. The scholar Onwuchekwa 
                Jemie, for instance, writes that “unlike the blues poem, the jazz poem 
                is without form.”<a href="#_edn28"
        name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> This viewpoint is in part a result of the proliferation 
                of jazz poetry during the early to mid seventies, that visibly—and deliberately—broke 
                from more traditional metrical forms. Avant-garde “free jazz” of the late 
                sixties and seventies that was closely associated with the alto saxophonist 
                Ornette Coleman and the pianist Cecil Taylor was seen as a model for poetic 
                experimentation. This music’s departure from “straight-ahead” jazz conventions 
                such as creating improvisations without preset chord progressions, suggests 
                a better parallel than blues forms offer for attempts to transform jazz 
                through poetry during this period. While it is true that the bulk of jazz 
                poems written during this period were in free verse, the absence of set 
                metrical patterns does not necessarily indicate the absence of <i>a</i> 
                pattern.</span> </font>

                that the poetry modeled after jazz is necessarily amorphous is not compatible 
                with the evidence at hand. Elizabeth Alexander’s poem “John Col” demonstrates 
                the contrary. I will recite Alexander’s poem in its entirety because its

                Gitler used to describe Coltrane’s rapid fire succession of streams of

                of Mullen’s aforementioned “unfurling sheets of bluish music”) Alexander’s 
                poem is pared down to a minimal number of words. In fact, because these 
                highly evocative words “beat,” “heart,” “blood,” “terrible,” beauty” and 
                “brass” are repeated with syntactical variance, the total number of unique 
                words in the poem is less than it appears. Word count is crucial to understanding 
                the poem’s structure; Alexander arranged the number of words or word fragments 
                in each line of each stanza with mathematical precision. Even the variance

                fragments per line but also there are no less than two. Also note that 
                each stanza has at least one “doubled pair” of lines with an equivalent 
                number of words (ie. “3, 3;” “2, 2;” “4, 4”). The two stanzas with the 
                exact same word count, “3-3-3-3,” are the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup> 
                stanzas; they are also the only two stanzas in the poem in which Coltrane’s 
                horn is mentioned. The fourth and the sixth stanzas, by comparison, vary 
                the total word count pattern of 12, they contain 13 and 15 words, respectively. 
                The last stanza is the only stanza with five lines instead of four; this 
                fifth line functions as a poetic equivalent of the “tag” in jazz. The 
                line extends the poem’s opening theme; “trane song” circles back to join 
                the opening line, “John Col,” which is also the poem’s title. The elegance 
                of Alexander’s structure is its near-invisibility. Unless the reader is 
                counting specifically for a numerical pattern, she would not necessarily 
                be fully aware of its existence. And yet it serves as a guiding principle

                of a skillfully executed jazz solo: the casual listener may hear only 
                a flurry of well-paced notes or well-timed silences that seem purely “spontaneous;” 
                unless the listener dissects the improvisation, note for note, he or she 
                may not be aware of the chord progressions upon which the improviser builds.</span>

                a structural and a textual level, Alexander’s verbal scripting of Coltrane’s 
                sound is characterized by syntactical restraint. If you look closely at 
                your handout, you will notice that the poem contains no commas, semicolons, 
                or periods, no punctuation to indicate grammatical pauses, stops or starts. 
                Instead Alexander achieves a syncopated, alternately jarring and fluid 
                rhythm in the poem by letting the silent spaces between the words speak. 
                The only extralexical marks in the poem, significantly, are the quotations

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>—is the poetic equivalent of a musical riff. Alexander 
                breaks apart and rearranges the phrase “a terrible beauty” as a jazz soloist 
                would fragment and “worry” a melodic line. A standard procedure in jazz 
                entails borrowing from other songs—that are not necessarily jazz tunes—and 
                folding them into a restructured melody, often transforming the original 
                tunes’ rhythmic framework and chord patterns. Similarly, Alexander’s manipulation 
                of the phrase “a terrible/beauty a horn” builds in a sample which echoes 
                crucial lines from Yeats’ poem “Easter 1916,” while transforming Yeats’ 
                recurrent verses. Alexander’s borrowing is structurally significant. The 
                concluding couplets for the first, second and final stanzas of “Easter 
                1916” are, respectively: “All changed, changed utterly:/A terrible beauty 
                is born.,” “Transformed utterly:/A terrible beauty is born.,” and “Are 
                changed, changed utterly:/A terrible beauty is born.”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31"
        title="">[31]</a> Alexander’s transformation of Yeats’ verse illustrates the striking 
                effects of structural change of a few similar lines. In <i>The First Book 
                of Jazz</i>, Langston Hughes declared that “Jazz is a <i>way of playing</i> 
                music even more than it is a composed music. Almost any music can become 
                jazz if it is played with jazz treatment.”<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32"
        title=""><span>[32]</span></a> Similarly, Alexander’s poem suggests that jazz 
                poetry can be seen as a way of playing with words, even more than it is 
                genre of poetry composed <i>about</i> jazz. </span> </font>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
                emphasis on “playing with words,” or more generally on “play,” seems a 
                suitable way to conclude my discussion of Moore, Mullen and Alexander. 
                For the question of play brings us back to the metaphor used for slam 
                competitions at the beginning of my talk. The noted film critic Roger 
                Ebert called this “performance art” a “muscular verbal sport.” Given the 
                </span>valorization of the spectacle of the written over and above the 
                “sport of the spoken word” in poetry scholarship, it is unlikely to see 
                poets such as Moore and Mullen discussed in the same context. Moreover, 
                due to the additional critical tendency to separate “formally innovative” 
                writers such as Mullen from so-called “neo-formalists” such as Alexander, 
                readers might not see them housed under the same tent. Yet I have endeavored 
                to illustrate that it takes only a leap—or following Moore’s aviary metaphor, 
                a flight—of critical faith to follow these three poets into whatever communal 
                territory their poetry leads.  Emerging poetry scholarship should be willing 
                to imagine <i>across</i> poetry communities, and if need be, to create 
                them. </font>

        style='font-size:12.0pt'> See for example, an earlier issue of <i>How2</i><u>,</u> 
                  in which Kimberly Lamm argues that “from [Gertrude] Stein’s work, Mullen 
                  extracts associational logic, verbal density that resists complete interpretive 
                  mastery by the reader, and a detached and idiosyncratic authorial presence. 
                  From [Zora Neale] Hurston’s work, Mullen extracts the performative and 
                  mimetic qualities of African-America [sic] dialect and its highly visual 
                  components while also emphasizing the way language participates in and 
                  shapes cultural and economic exchanges.” Kimberly Lamm, “Modernist Clothes 
                  Made New: The Visible Presence of Zora Neale Hurston and Gertrude Stein 
                  in Harryette Mullen’s <i>Trimmings</i>,” <i><u>How2</u></i>, &lt;http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/current/readings/lamm.html&gt;. 
                  Also see Elisabeth Frost’s remarks in <i>Postmodern Culture</i> that 
                  both Harryette Mullen and Leslie Scalapino “use a fundamentally Steinian 
                  lnaguage yet voice difference that Stein tended to avoid in her poetry—issues 
                  of race, class and inequity in American culture.” Elizabeth A. Frost, 
                  “Signifying on Stein: The Revisionist Poetics of Harryette Mullen and 
                  Leslie Scalapino,” <i>Postmodern Culture</i>, n.p. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v005/5.3frost.html&gt; 
                  I should add that I am not disputing the influence of Stein’s work on 
                  Mullen’s poetics or form of composition that both Lamm and Frost lucidly 
                  demonstrate. Instead, it is my contention that such categorization of 
                  the “innovative” and intricate as “white” and the vernacular and transparent
