          <i>Black Chant: Languages of African-American Postmodernism</i>(1997), 
          a significant contribution to discussions of African-American literary 
          production, Aldon Nielsen supplies a literary history for alternate traditions 
          of African-American poetry. If both the recently diversified contemporary 
          mainstream canon and the recently established African-American canon tend 
          to include poets who are selected as representatives of blackness, Nielsen 
          focuses his critical study on “…poets whose works interrogate what literary 
          society conceives to be blackness, what languages and what forms are critically 
          associated with constructions of cultural blackness…”(168) Their aesthetic 
          and intellectual practices enable these writers and their readers to explore 
          the possibilities and limits of prevailing discourses, with the flexibility 
          to be interrogative as well as declarative.</font></span>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, 
          in taking up the term that Nielsen uses, “interrogate,” I want to apply 
          it in its original sense of “standing between and asking questions.” I 
          would suggest that the poets whose work is interrogative in this way have 
          located their poetry in a space between declarative representations of 
          blackness and a critical engagement with the cultural and discursive practices 
          by which evolving identities are recognized, articulated, and defined. 
          The works of these poets have contributed to a dialogue that was initiated 
          on the margins of both the mainstream culture and the traditional or popular 
          culture of African Americans, a discourse on black alterity. This discourse 
          of “other blackness” (rather than “black otherness”) has recently begun 
          to move into a larger discussion of the multiplicity and dissonance—the 
          flip side of unity or homogeneity—of African American cultures and identities.</span> 
          </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
          exploratory interrogation of black identity as a social, cultural, and 
          discursive formation raises critical questions about conventional representations 
          of black identity, allowing the meanings of blackness to proliferate and 
          expand, thus stretching black identity and making it more inclusive; but 
          also allowing instability in defining what blackness is. If the Black 
          Arts movement of the 1960s and 70s was primarily concerned with defining 
          and empowering blackness, while helping to reverse the cultural “whitewashing” 
          of African Americans, several poets associated with this movement defined 
          blackness specifically in ways that celebrated young militant black male 
          heterosexuals and their supportive female comrades, partners, and admirers, 
          while frequently alienating other elements of the African-American communities 
          they ostensibly hoped to organize and empower. Perhaps this orientation 
          of the movement was intended to recruit an army of cultural warriors, 
          attracted to black art as a safely masculine arena for young men who might 
          otherwise have avoided what was regarded in some quarters as an effeminate 
          activity.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
          their attempt to purge African Americans of cultural whiteness, some proponents 
          of black power vilified middle class and homosexual lifestyles, seeing 
          both as examples of blackness tainted and emasculated by decadent whiteness. 
          Two primary sources for the most galvanizing rhetoric and influential 
          styles of the Black Power and Black Arts movements, Malcolm X and Amiri 
          Baraka, regarded themselves as having been corrupted by their earlier 
          association with whiteness, queer sexualities, and a square middle-class 
          background. Both men renamed themselves, creating new identities that 
          inverted previously held values: Malcolm Little fled the middle-class 
          pretensions of Boston's black strivers, transforming himself into a conked, 
          reefer-smoking, lindy-hopping zoot-suiter, who later converted into a 
          minister of the Nation of Islam, accepting Elijah Muhammad&#146;s demonization 
          of the white race; LeRoi Jones repudiated the black bourgeoisie and white 
          bohemia, as allegorized in his 1964 play <i>Dutchman. </i>Although both 
          eventually modified their radical positions, they contributed to the extreme 
          rhetoric of radical black movements of the 1960s, as seen in the revolutionary 
          style and swagger of militant leaders of the Black Panther political party. 
          These charismatic leaders offered themselves as case studies for the project 
          of purifying black identity and black culture of contaminating effects 
          of white domination, with which they often conflated bourgeois culture, 
          homosexuality, and the Judeo-Christian religious tradition.</span></font></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My remarks 
          will focus not primarily on formally innovative work, but on recent black 
          poetry that has been enabled by theoretical discourse and avant-garde 
          practices. Black poets who began to publish in the 1990s have begun to 
          incorporate into a more accessible poetic language the critical interrogation 
          of cultural meanings of blackness. These poets are investigating the boundaries 
          of racial and cultural identity, and articulating precisely the positions 
          of class and sexuality that were excluded from the center of blackness 
          as defined in the Black Arts movement. While additional names might be 
          added to this discussion, I have selected as examples of this development 
          in poetry the work of Elizabeth Alexander, G.E. Patterson, Akilah Oliver, 
          and Suheir Hammad.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these, 
          Alexander is the most widely known and published, with two well-received 
          books, inclusion in several anthologies, and the academic credentials 
          that led to a faculty position at the University of Chicago. Patterson 
          is a well-regarded emerging poet, who has been a fellow at the MacDowell 
          Colony and whose first book has been noted in a publication co-sponsored 
          by the Academy of American Poets. Hammad is also an emerging poet whose 
          first book contains several poems that employ the urban vernacular style 
          of hip hop and spoken word performance. Oliver, an adjunct faculty member 
          at Naropa University, has the most edgily disjunctive poetics. Her work 
          also emerges from a performance background, in her case as a founding 
          member of the multiracial avant-garde feminist group, The Sacred Naked 
          Nature Girls, whose collaborative work examines the social inscription 
          of identity on the bodies of women.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
          two published books of poetry, <i>The Venus Hottentot</i> (1990) and <i>Body 
          of Life</i>(1996) Elizabeth Alexander has given us work of clarity and 
          complexity, that is at once pleasurably accessible and intellectually 
          sophisticated. Her poetry offers a thoughtful meditation on the contradictions 
          of postmodern identity, with the poet, herself the offspring of a materially 
          comfortable and socially conscious black family, negotiating between popular 
          culture&#146;s bi-polar representations of blackness as a signifier of 
          lack, deprivation, and negation, versus blackness as a signifier of conspicuous 
          consumption, unaccustomed privilege, and unrestrained excess. Between 
          opposing signs, she posits her intimate knowledge of black humanity, her 
          observation and experience of creativity, energy, imagination, pleasure, 
          as well as desire, unfulfilled yearning, and unmet need.</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In poems 
          such as “Nineteen,”<i>(The Venus Hottentot) </i>“Haircut,” <i>(Body of 
          Life,</i> 60-61) “Six Yellow Stanzas”<i>(Body of Life,</i> 51-54) and 
          “Race” <i>(Giant Steps,</i> 19-20), Alexander&#146;s location between 
          cultural representations of whiteness and blackness provides the occasion 
          for the poet to re-affirm her African-American identity as she simultaneously 
          articulates her class identification as a product of the black and “high 
          yellow” bourgeoisie. Alexander claims all of her experience as a variety 
          of black experience: memories of debutante balls and dreams of giving 
          birth to a yellow baby in “Six Yellow Stanzas”; a youthful sexual encounter 
          with an older black working-class man, a Vietnam veteran she meets on 
          her first job away from home, in “Nineteen”; to a haircut in Harlem that 
          allows the poet to imagine herself a New York “flygirl,” as she travels 
          on the IRT, self-consciously <i>buys black </i>in Harlem's black-owned 
          businesses, and insistently connecting her personal and family history 
          to the aesthetic, cultural, and historical movements of Harlem&#146;s 
          black community, where her unkinky hair and “riny” complexion blend into 
          the continuum of textures and hues that constitute blackness. Alexander&#146;s 
          embrace of her own particular black experience extends to include even 
          the once-taboo mention of a relative who passed as a white man, in “Race.”</span>

          examples of Pat Parker and Audre Lorde behind her (poets among the brave 
          ones who emerged at a time when the conflicting radical interests of the 
          Black Power, feminist, and sexual identity movements left a minefield 
          of contested space for lesbians of color), Oliver confronts the complications 
          inherent in her own identity as a black woman born in St. Louis and raised 
          in South Central Los Angeles, trying to parent her son in the driven snow 
          of Boulder, Colorado while involved in an interracial lesbian relationship.</span></font></p>

          explores the possibilities for freedom, innovation, and critical thinking 
          in the conscious choice of outsider status, an escape from the sometimes 
          oppressive spaces in which black people have learned to survive, to the 
          sanitized spaces of affluence that white privilege affords, a space in 
          which it is possible for a struggling artist to live off the fat of the 
          land. Oliver recalls a journal entry in which she recorded her son&#146;s 
          first response to Boulder: “It looks so nice, it must be hiding something.”(Conversation 
          with author, July 3, 2000) Like a tourist with an expired visa, Oliver 
          turned a visit to Boulder into an extended stay instead of returning to 
          a Los Angeles home rocked by earthquakes and riots. Although her sense 
          of writing as insurrection was inspired by the insurgent poetry of the 
          Black Arts movement, Oliver&#146;s transgressive text challenges the essentialist 
          identity politics of black cultural nationalism as much as it interrogates 
          how white privilege operates in a place “so nice, it must be hiding something.”

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Oliver sees her work as necessarily transgressive, requiring 
          an intersection of the sacred and profane, as she creates a discursive 
          space for the inclusion of all of her spiritual and physical, personal 
          and political, individual and collective selves. The poet articulates 
          her own sense of erotic desire and transcendence, aware that her existence 
          violates what others cherish as sacred truth. Her work creates a discursive 
          space for the inclusion of all of her spiritual and physical, personal 
          and political, individual and collective selves. As in the work of Chicana 
          author Cherrie Moraga, Oliver&#146;s poetry profanes patriarchal religion 
          as it sacralizes lesbian sexuality, seeking to escape the controlling 
          discourse of church fathers regarding the separation of body and soul, 
          the divine right of masculine power and privilege, the holiness of celibacy, 
          the sanctity of heterosexual marriage, and the sin of homosexuality. Oliver 
          also questions the secular significance of &#147;black soul,&#148; given 
          the pervasive influence of African Americans on mainstream popular culture 
          and the global impact of black performers and musicians.</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>“Yo Baby Yo”(41-43) and “Brown Bread Hero” (59-60),<i> 
          </i>poems included in <i>Born Palestinian, Born Black</i>(1996) were written 
          by a woman who is the daughter of Palestinian refugees. Hammad was born 
          in Jordan and lived for a time in Beirut before moving with her family 
          to Brooklyn.</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her 
          work, on the one hand, suggests a more expansive definition of blackness 
          that encompasses more than race. Identification as black may also have 
          to do with such issues as shared experience, cultural fluency, political 
          solidarity, and styles of verbal performance. In “Brown Bread Hero,” Hammad&#146;s 
          aversion to the smothering blandness that she associates with the dominant 
          culture's ideology of whiteness takes her into the political and cultural 
          terrain of liberatory darkness.(Perhaps she also alludes to lactose intolerance, 
          a genetic trait common to peoples of African, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean 
          descent that distinguishes their traditional dietary preferences from 
          those of Northern Europeans.)</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 
          other hand, Hammad&#146;s verbal performance in “Yo Baby Yo” points to 
          the constructedness of black language, black voice, and black experience 
          (or any other language, voice, and experience) reminding us that indeed 
          blackness is a social construction, that any language, culture, or dialect 
          is acquired. Hammad's poem might be read as an illustration of the availability 
          of contemporary black vernacular and its formulaic tropes to others besides 
          African American speakers and writers or, less generously, as a caricature 
          of urban black vernacular that is uncomfortably similar to those found 
          throughout mainstream popular culture, including the gold and platinum 
          CDs of hip hop artists.</span> </font>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude 
          my discussion, Suheir Hammad, Akilah Oliver, G.E. Patterson, and Elizabeth 
          Alexander have all written poems that trouble the waters of blackness. 
          These poets give us opportunities to re-examine the boundaries that were 
          drawn in order to define the declarative blackness celebrated in the Black 
          Arts movement. Questioning such boundaries of class, sexuality, and even 
          race itself, they all indicate in different ways and from different subject 
          positions that blackness has become a space for critical and aesthetic 
          interrogation both from within and outside the canon of African-American 
          literature.</span> <br>
