          Hunt is the inheritor of a legacy gone missing. A legacy of avant-garde 
          practice by African-American women poets including Julia Fields and Elouise 
          Loftin. A legacy of work that has escaped the notice of most scholars, 
          that has been allowed to go out of print, or was poorly published in the 
          first place. It is important to situate Hunt within this context of innovative 
          African-American writing, a corollary and a parallel process of which 
          is dismantling the construction of the American poetry avant-garde as 
          white. The history of avant-garde practice by African-American women poets 
          has been both misplaced and misread, leading to readings of avant-garde 
          literatures that are entirely too white, and collections of African-American 
          literature that eschew formal experimentation.</font></span></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt, 
          whose lineage includes Language poets, feminist writers, and politicized 
          writers of color, produces works that draw upon these categories while 
          at the same time exploding the boundaries between them. In drawing from 
          these multiple trajectories, a reading of Hunt’s work makes apparent the 
          ways in which scholarly mappings of these traditions have been insufficient. 
          While Hunt is commonly referred to as an “experimental” poet, the term 
          “experimental” as used in relation to American literatures is both an 
          over-used and under-theorized category. Erica Hunt's work requires one 
          to position the term “experimental” across literary traditions, to understand 
          how the term is used in the contemporary understandings of each tradition, 
          as well as how its meaning has migrated historically. This paper seeks 
          to position an understanding of experimentalism across the traditions 
          from which Hunt draws—African-American, women’s, and avant-garde literatures—in 
          order to both contextualize and provide a reading of Hunt’s writing practices.</span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
          instructive to begin with a statement of poetics by Hunt, an essay entitled, 
          “Notes for an Oppositional Poetics.” This essay reveals that Hunt, a social 
          activist, is intimately involved with working to dismantle those social 
          structures that maintain racial and patriarchal hegemonic systems. She 
          has incorporated these ideals into the interrogation of language, a fundamental 
          part of her poetic experiment:</span></font></p>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>One 
              troubling aspect of privileging language as the primary site to torque 
              new meaning and possibility is that it is severed from the political 
              question of for whom new meaning is produced. The ideal reader is 
              an endangered species, the committed reader has an ideological agenda 
              both open and closed, flawed and acute, that we do not address directly. 
              On one level the lack of address is a problem of the dispersed character 
              of the social movements in this country at present; on another level 
              it is the general difficulty of looking squarely at the roles we play 
              as writers in forming social consciousness (“Notes” 687).</span></font></p>

         <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
          Hunt, then, language as a political tool—and the role writers play in 
          shaping, illuminating, or subverting it—is at the heart of her writing 
          practice. Hunt goes on to call for a poetics in which it is “important 
          to think how writing can begin to develop among oppositional groups, how 
          writing can begin to have a social existence in a world where authority 
          has become highly mobile, based less on identity and on barely discerned 
          or discussed relationships”(“Notes” 687). This passage from the one articulation 
          of poetics Hunt has published is particularly useful in understanding 
          the ways in which her writing negotiates between what might narrowly be 
          called “Language poetry” and a kind of “testimonial” social voice often 
          expected from African-American poets.<a
  href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>  In short, Hunt incorporates 
          aspects of both projects in producing a work that contains recognizable 
          elements at the same time that it is entirely “new.”</font></span>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we 
          will see throughout this paper, critical readings which are based upon 
          and reinforce identity-based categories often perform a kind of normalizing 
          function, enforcing conservative reading practices and expectations. What 
          does it mean to read a writer such as Hunt up against the canonized versions 
          of African-American writing? I propose that a new critical history is 
          necessary to encompass readings of radical African-American literary practices, 
          a tradition that includes such writers as Fields, Oliver Pitcher, Lloyd 
          Addison, and Norman Henry Pritchard, and was carried forward through the 
          work of several poets including Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, and Bob Kaufman. 
          Readings that posit the avant-garde of American poetries as white have 
          contributed to the disappearance of a number of these writers equally 
          as well as a conservative black aesthetics that cannot account for their 
          language and poetic experiments. The influence of these writers is felt 
          on practicing contemporary African-American poets including Hunt, Harryette 
          Mullen, Will Alexander, and Nathaniel Mackey.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we 
          widen the conversation about black writing to include the precursors to 
          the Black Arts Movement detailed in Aldon Nielsen’s excellent history 
          of post-World War II black experimental poetries, <i>Black Chant: Languages 
          of African-American Postmodernism</i>, we can begin to see how the work 
          of a writer such as Hunt participates in a dialogue which might include 
          both African-American poets from, for example, the Umbra Group, <i>and</i> 
          the Language poets, a loosely connected group that was never made up exclusively 
          of white men in the first place, though some critical histories may lead 
          readers to believe that to be the case.</span></font></p>
         
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
          begin to see, then, with the example of Hunt’s work, that the question 
          was never “either/or:” either form or content, either black or avant-garde. 
          Her work illustrates the ways in which reading the histories of African-American 
          literature and avant-garde poetries as separate colludes in a kind of 
          essentializing of “identity” in American letters that leads one to draw 
          pre-formed conclusions about the ways in which African-American literature 
          is supposed to behave. Indeed, meeting normative expectations for how 
          and what an African-American writer should write has often been a prerequisite 
          to success. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Again, if 
          we go back to Nielsen, we see that the necessary critical acclaim from 
          predominantly white critics and editors was often achieved by black poets 
          who “sounded black” or included “black subject matter” or content. For 
          those writers who persisted in “sounding black” in a way that was not 
          recognizable to a white audience, publication was hard-won, or often non-existent.

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American 
          literatures that are seen as part and parcel of “identity”(eg. women’s 
          literature, African-American literature, lesbian literature) are pigeonholed 
          by particular expectations for form and content. Indeed, it has been the 
          texts that meet those expectations that have been more readily canonized. 
          In the particular case of “women’s writing,” texts that meet normative 
          expectations for narrative form have garnered favor from mainstream academic 
          critics, whereas texts which employ such techniques as visual experimentation 
          or use of the entire page as a field are still often absent from college 
          curricula. These choices were borne out of cultural feminist publishing 
          projects that celebrated women’s poetry, particularly writing about women’s 
          experiences. A range of “experiences” or subject matter constituted the 
          primary litmus test for what might be considered “feminist” writing. What 
          was ignored, however, was the fact that these writers were filling the 
          same container—the narrative poem which became institutionalized in American 
          literature after World War II—albeit with different content. As Lynn Keller 
          and Cristanne Miller illustrate in their paper “Gender and Avant-Garde 
          Editing: Comparing the 1920s with the 1990s,” the academy continues to 
          exacerbate the division between “testimonial” or primarily narrative-based 
          works, and feminist poetry that is concerned with linguistic innovation, 
          and therefore is more “experimental”: </span></font></p>

              contributions to experimental poetry publication today are not well

              and because the greatest impetus for reading, teaching, and publishing 
              works by women has come from feminist scholars, the view from academe 
              tends to obscure women’s publishing that does not fit this mold. Thus, 
              Kim Whitehead’s scholarly study, <i>The Feminist Poetry Movement</i> 
              (published in 1996), assumes that there is only one feminist poetry 
              movement, best represented by Minnie Bruce Pratt, June Jordan, Judy 
              Grahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Irena Klepfisz, and Joy Harjo. In her brief

              Wong’s <i>Dreams in Harrison Railroad Park</i>), but she seems generally 
              unaware of publishing ventures that exhibit versions of feminism concerned 
              with the gendered implications of literary conventions and linguistic

          of this tradition. Rather, it is more likely that work by writers such 
          as Erica Hunt did not fit neatly within Whitehead’s particular feminist 
          reading, ie. innovative writing does not “represent” in a way that a feminist

          and Miller go on to point out that the academic feminist focus on identity 
          politics in literature creates a particularly dire situation for women 
          of color doing experimental writing: “It has contributed especially to 
          the invisibility of the women of color whose experimentalist work resists 
          fulfilling conventional expectations for work that ‘represents’—in the 
          sense both of representational aesthetics and of demographic representativeness—cultural 
          diversity.” Those expectation for racial “representativeness” are now 
          institutionalized within white liberal ideological systems in such institutions 
          as the university which seek “diversity” in a way that collapses racial 
          categories into unitary structures that least threaten dominant power 
          systems. As Hunt points out in  “Notes for an Oppositional Poetics”:</span>

              the fissures. Opposition is alternately demonized or accommodated

          informed by identity politics. Michael Awkward examines this topic in

              text does, but what it can do for the Afro-American reader), and is 
              infinitely more concerned with content than with formal strategies. 
              Scholars whose use of critical theory suggests to Joyce that they

              of George Kent, a singular adventure of blackness in Western culture, 
              Joyce and other traditional Afro-American critics argue that experience 
              ought to lead to a common, overtly political interpretation that is 
              essentially unconcerned with the aesthetic qualities of black texts.(30)</span></font></p>

          interrogate what it means for a poet to participate in a conversation 
          about what a black aesthetic contains, means, and signifies. The work 
          does so in a way that engages form as well as what might broadly be called 
          “content.” Furthermore, her writing participates in dismantling normative 
          reading expectations while still concerning itself fundamentally with 
          issues of race and gender. By taking on constructions of race on the level

          is Booker T. Washington’s 1895 address to the Negro exhibit of the Atlanta 
          Cotton States and International Exposition, which Baker reads as an enactment 
          of the performance of minstrelsy: “And it is, first and foremost, the 
          mastery of the minstrel mask by blacks that constitutes a primary move 
          in Afro-American discursive modernism.”(17) This “mastery of form” is

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>For the African-American writer, then, mastery of dominant 
          forms took on a subversive quality. Indeed, this mastery had to take place 
          in African-American literature before what Baker calls the “deformation 
          of mastery” could occur. In learning to manipulate the dominant discursive 
          practice—which was the vernacular—Washington negotiated an effective method 
          of black speaking in which to “talk back” to the oppressor. Therefore, 
          Hunt’s refusal of “black vernacular” or the “authentic voice” must be 
          understood within its historical moment. It is a moment in which the very 
          notion of “authenticity” is called into question, and black speaking/writing 
          has attained multivalent structures. As always, the sanctioned or canonized 
          version of what that voice should entail is structured to support particular 
          ideologies. I propose that traditional scholars currently fail to recognize 
          those texts by African-American women that refuse to meet orderly narrative 
          expectations. If we were to project Baker’s argument further, Hunt’s work 
          takes the next logical step, in effect enacting “the deformation of the 
          deformation of mastery.”</span></font></p>

          witness to a world order in which appearances are not what they seem: 
          “In an era of palaces inhabited by officials who’ve inherited their squint 
          you have to do more than scratch the surface” (<i>Local History</i> 40). 
          Hunt’s first collection of poems, <i>Local History</i>(1993), was published 
          by small press publisher Roof Books in New York and includes three sections 
          of poems. In this book, Hunt does indeed do more than simply “scratch 
          the surface.” For Hunt the surreal is given over to the ordinary facts 
          of existence, which for her bear political import. She extends the feminist

              revealing, more authentic text. Frequently the female subject, as

          Hunt uses the form to her advantage in the series of letters punningly 
          entitled “Correspondence Theory.”(<i>Local History</i> 33) An exchange 
          addressed simply to “Dear” is in turn answered “Dear Dear” a salutation 
          that also functions as a kind of lament. One can imagine a womanly figure 
          looking out over Hunt’s landscape of urban decay, racial tension, a hurricane 
          about to hit the city, and shaking her head: “Dear Dear,” indeed. In this 
          world, the city has become a Disneyland façade, complete with “natives,” 
          in which the city’s functions have been commandeered for the comfort of 
          tourists. “Street signs are moved around, and streets renamed so that 
          tourists walk only sanctioned loops. The loops concentrate site; representative

            exemplified by such anthologies as Ron Silliman’s <i>In The American 
            Tree </i>and<i> The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book </i>edited by Bruce Andrews 
            and Charles Bernstein.</font></p>

  name="_edn2" title=""><span>[2]</span></a> This applies equally to writers of 
            fiction, as well as poets. Chester Himes’s novel <i>Yesterday Will Make 
            You Cry</i> was published in a barely recognizable version by editors 
            during his lifetime and was only recently released in its intended form 
            by Old School Press in 1998. As the Old School editors point out in 
            their introduction, “Himes had decided to tell the story of his life 
            using the voice of a white man, Jimmy Monroe, which enabled him to draw 
            a few red herrings across the trail and resolve what appeared at the 
            time as an irrevocable contradiction: being a black man <i>and</i> a 
            writer and demonstrating that it is possible for an African American 
            to go beyond ghetto experience…The editors deliberately and relentlessly 
            erased the tenderer and more artistic aspects to turn Himes’s manuscript 
            into a hard-boiled prison novel. For many publishers in those days, 
            the only place where the black man was not an invisible man was in a 
            prison cell.” (Himes, 8).</font></p>
