        Hunt is the inheritor of a legacy gone missing. A legacy of avant-garde 
        practice by African-American women poets including Julia Fields and Elouise 
        Loftin. A legacy of work that has escaped the notice of most scholars, 
        that has been allowed to go out of print, or was poorly published in the 
        first place. It is important to situate Hunt within this context of innovative 
        African-American writing, a corollary and a parallel process of which 
        is dismantling the construction of the American poetry avant-garde as 
        white. The history of avant-garde practice by African-American women poets 
        has been both misplaced and misread, leading to readings of avant-garde 
        literatures that are entirely too white, and collections of African-American 
        literature that eschew formal experimentation.</font></span></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt, 
        whose lineage includes Language poets, feminist writers, and politicized 
        writers of color, produces works that draw upon these categories while 
        at the same time exploding the boundaries between them. In drawing from 
        these multiple trajectories, a reading of Hunt’s work makes apparent the 
        ways in which scholarly mappings of these traditions have been insufficient. 
        While Hunt is commonly referred to as an “experimental” poet, the term 
        “experimental” as used in relation to American literatures is both an 
        over-used and under-theorized category. Erica Hunt's work requires one 
        to position the term “experimental” across literary traditions, to understand 
        how the term is used in the contemporary understandings of each tradition, 
        as well as how its meaning has migrated historically. This paper seeks 
        to position an understanding of experimentalism across the traditions 
        from which Hunt draws—African-American, women’s, and avant-garde literatures—in 
        order to both contextualize and provide a reading of Hunt’s writing practices.</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
        instructive to begin with a statement of poetics by Hunt, an essay entitled, 
        “Notes for an Oppositional Poetics.” This essay reveals that Hunt, a social 
        activist, is intimately involved with working to dismantle those social 
        structures that maintain racial and patriarchal hegemonic systems. She 
        has incorporated these ideals into the interrogation of language, a fundamental 
        part of her poetic experiment:</span></font></p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>One 
            troubling aspect of privileging language as the primary site to torque 
            new meaning and possibility is that it is severed from the political 
            question of for whom new meaning is produced. The ideal reader is 
            an endangered species, the committed reader has an ideological agenda 
            both open and closed, flawed and acute, that we do not address directly. 
            On one level the lack of address is a problem of the dispersed character 
            of the social movements in this country at present; on another level 
            it is the general difficulty of looking squarely at the roles we play 
            as writers in forming social consciousness (“Notes” 687).</span></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
       <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
        Hunt, then, language as a political tool—and the role writers play in 
        shaping, illuminating, or subverting it—is at the heart of her writing 
        practice. Hunt goes on to call for a poetics in which it is “important 
        to think how writing can begin to develop among oppositional groups, how 
        writing can begin to have a social existence in a world where authority 
        has become highly mobile, based less on identity and on barely discerned 
        or discussed relationships”(“Notes” 687). This passage from the one articulation 
        of poetics Hunt has published is particularly useful in understanding 
        the ways in which her writing negotiates between what might narrowly be 
        called “Language poetry” and a kind of “testimonial” social voice often 
        expected from African-American poets.<a
href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>  In short, Hunt incorporates 
        aspects of both projects in producing a work that contains recognizable 
        elements at the same time that it is entirely “new.”</font></span>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we 
        will see throughout this paper, critical readings which are based upon 
        and reinforce identity-based categories often perform a kind of normalizing 
        function, enforcing conservative reading practices and expectations. What 
        does it mean to read a writer such as Hunt up against the canonized versions 
        of African-American writing? I propose that a new critical history is 
        necessary to encompass readings of radical African-American literary practices, 
        a tradition that includes such writers as Fields, Oliver Pitcher, Lloyd 
        Addison, and Norman Henry Pritchard, and was carried forward through the 
        work of several poets including Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, and Bob Kaufman. 
        Readings that posit the avant-garde of American poetries as white have 
        contributed to the disappearance of a number of these writers equally 
        as well as a conservative black aesthetics that cannot account for their 
        language and poetic experiments. The influence of these writers is felt 
        on practicing contemporary African-American poets including Hunt, Harryette 
        Mullen, Will Alexander, and Nathaniel Mackey.</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we 
        widen the conversation about black writing to include the precursors to 
        the Black Arts Movement detailed in Aldon Nielsen’s excellent history 
        of post-World War II black experimental poetries, <i>Black Chant: Languages 
        of African-American Postmodernism</i>, we can begin to see how the work 
        of a writer such as Hunt participates in a dialogue which might include 
        both African-American poets from, for example, the Umbra Group, <i>and</i> 
        the Language poets, a loosely connected group that was never made up exclusively 
        of white men in the first place, though some critical histories may lead 
        readers to believe that to be the case.</span></font></p>
       
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        begin to see, then, with the example of Hunt’s work, that the question 
        was never “either/or:” either form or content, either black or avant-garde. 
        Her work illustrates the ways in which reading the histories of African-American 
        literature and avant-garde poetries as separate colludes in a kind of 
        essentializing of “identity” in American letters that leads one to draw 
        pre-formed conclusions about the ways in which African-American literature 
        is supposed to behave. Indeed, meeting normative expectations for how 
        and what an African-American writer should write has often been a prerequisite 
        to success. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> Again, if 
        we go back to Nielsen, we see that the necessary critical acclaim from 
        predominantly white critics and editors was often achieved by black poets 
        who “sounded black” or included “black subject matter” or content. For 
        those writers who persisted in “sounding black” in a way that was not 
        recognizable to a white audience, publication was hard-won, or often non-existent. 
        </font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American 
        literatures that are seen as part and parcel of “identity”(eg. women’s 
        literature, African-American literature, lesbian literature) are pigeonholed 
        by particular expectations for form and content. Indeed, it has been the 
        texts that meet those expectations that have been more readily canonized. 
        In the particular case of “women’s writing,” texts that meet normative 
        expectations for narrative form have garnered favor from mainstream academic 
        critics, whereas texts which employ such techniques as visual experimentation 
        or use of the entire page as a field are still often absent from college 
        curricula. These choices were borne out of cultural feminist publishing 
        projects that celebrated women’s poetry, particularly writing about women’s 
        experiences. A range of “experiences” or subject matter constituted the 
        primary litmus test for what might be considered “feminist” writing. What 
        was ignored, however, was the fact that these writers were filling the 
        same container—the narrative poem which became institutionalized in American 
        literature after World War II—albeit with different content. As Lynn Keller 
        and Cristanne Miller illustrate in their paper “Gender and Avant-Garde 
        Editing: Comparing the 1920s with the 1990s,” the academy continues to 
        exacerbate the division between “testimonial” or primarily narrative-based 
        works, and feminist poetry that is concerned with linguistic innovation, 
        and therefore is more “experimental”: </span></font></p>

            contributions to experimental poetry publication today are not well 
            recognized in current scholarly narratives. Because American academic 
            feminism has generally allied itself with an identity politics focus, 
            and because the greatest impetus for reading, teaching, and publishing 
            works by women has come from feminist scholars, the view from academe 
            tends to obscure women’s publishing that does not fit this mold. Thus, 
            Kim Whitehead’s scholarly study, <i>The Feminist Poetry Movement</i> 
            (published in 1996), assumes that there is only one feminist poetry 
            movement, best represented by Minnie Bruce Pratt, June Jordan, Judy 
            Grahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Irena Klepfisz, and Joy Harjo. In her brief

            Wong’s <i>Dreams in Harrison Railroad Park</i>), but she seems generally 
            unaware of publishing ventures that exhibit versions of feminism concerned

        of this tradition. Rather, it is more likely that work by writers such

        and Miller go on to point out that the academic feminist focus on identity 
        politics in literature creates a particularly dire situation for women 
        of color doing experimental writing: “It has contributed especially to 
        the invisibility of the women of color whose experimentalist work resists 
        fulfilling conventional expectations for work that ‘represents’—in the 
        sense both of representational aesthetics and of demographic representativeness—cultural 
        diversity.” Those expectation for racial “representativeness” are now 
        institutionalized within white liberal ideological systems in such institutions 
        as the university which seek “diversity” in a way that collapses racial 
        categories into unitary structures that least threaten dominant power 
        systems. As Hunt points out in  “Notes for an Oppositional Poetics”:</span>

        informed by identity politics. Michael Awkward examines this topic in

            text does, but what it can do for the Afro-American reader), and is 
            infinitely more concerned with content than with formal strategies. 
            Scholars whose use of critical theory suggests to Joyce that they 
            are more interested in exploring language of the black text than in 
            studying its potentially inspiring content are accused of disloyalty 
            to the cause of black liberation. Pre-supposing a uniform Afro-American 
            experience of racism or, in the words (if not the precise wording) 
            of George Kent, a singular adventure of blackness in Western culture, 
            Joyce and other traditional Afro-American critics argue that experience 
            ought to lead to a common, overtly political interpretation that is 
            essentially unconcerned with the aesthetic qualities of black texts.(30)</span></font></p>

        interrogate what it means for a poet to participate in a conversation 
        about what a black aesthetic contains, means, and signifies. The work 
        does so in a way that engages form as well as what might broadly be called 
        “content.” Furthermore, her writing participates in dismantling normative 
        reading expectations while still concerning itself fundamentally with 
        issues of race and gender. By taking on constructions of race on the level

        that the current canon of African-American literature (as exemplified 
        by the new Norton anthology) champions work that fulfills traditional

        of Hunt becomes more complex, however, when we consider Houston Baker’s 
        historical approach to reading black literary conservatism and black literary 
        experimentalism. Baker provides insight into the ways in which black writing 
        has negotiated, encompassed, and rebelled against normative literary expectations. 
        Readings of black vernacular have changed over time, having been seen 
        variously as reactionary and radical. In <i>Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance</i>, 
        Baker proposes that the defining moment in African-American modernism 
        is Booker T. Washington’s 1895 address to the Negro exhibit of the Atlanta 
        Cotton States and International Exposition, which Baker reads as an enactment 
        of the performance of minstrelsy: “And it is, first and foremost, the 
        mastery of the minstrel mask by blacks that constitutes a primary move 
        in Afro-American discursive modernism.”(17) This “mastery of form” is 
        an example of radical “back talk” for the African-American speaker/writer:</span></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
           <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Obviously, an Afro-American spokesperson who wished 
            to engage in a masterful and empowering play within the minstrel spirit 
            house needed the uncanny ability to manipulate bizarre phonic legacies. 
            For he or she had the task of transforming the mask and its sounds 
            into negotiable discursive currency. In effect, the task was the production 
            of a manual of black speaking, a book of speaking <i>back and black</i>.”(Baker 
            24)</span></font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For the African-American writer, then, mastery of dominant 
        forms took on a subversive quality. Indeed, this mastery had to take place 
        in African-American literature before what Baker calls the “deformation 
        of mastery” could occur. In learning to manipulate the dominant discursive 
        practice—which was the vernacular—Washington negotiated an effective method 
        of black speaking in which to “talk back” to the oppressor. Therefore, 
        Hunt’s refusal of “black vernacular” or the “authentic voice” must be 
        understood within its historical moment. It is a moment in which the very 
        notion of “authenticity” is called into question, and black speaking/writing 
        has attained multivalent structures. As always, the sanctioned or canonized 
        version of what that voice should entail is structured to support particular 
        ideologies. I propose that traditional scholars currently fail to recognize

        expectations. If we were to project Baker’s argument further, Hunt’s work 
        takes the next logical step, in effect enacting “the deformation of the

        playful prose-like poems shatter paradigms unprepared for texts that serve 
        up language into new histories, local histories of a black woman who is 
        witness to a world order in which appearances are not what they seem: 
        “In an era of palaces inhabited by officials who’ve inherited their squint 
        you have to do more than scratch the surface” (<i>Local History</i> 40). 
        Hunt’s first collection of poems, <i>Local History</i>(1993), was published 
        by small press publisher Roof Books in New York and includes three sections 
        of poems. In this book, Hunt does indeed do more than simply “scratch 
        the surface.” For Hunt the surreal is given over to the ordinary facts 
        of existence, which for her bear political import. She extends the feminist 
        engagement with the “personal” in both political content and her overall 
        project.</span></font></p>

            letters are usually presented as written for private not public purposes. 
            Once they have been made public—after some remarkable or fortuitous 
            chance—they are presumed to be part of a secret and therefore more 
            revealing, more authentic text. Frequently the female subject, as 
            in <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i> or <i>Clarissa</i>, is of a ‘propertied’

        the history of female subjectivity. Taken into the hands of a black woman

        Hunt uses the form to her advantage in the series of letters punningly 
        entitled “Correspondence Theory.”(<i>Local History</i> 33) An exchange 
        addressed simply to “Dear” is in turn answered “Dear Dear” a salutation 
        that also functions as a kind of lament. One can imagine a womanly figure 
        looking out over Hunt’s landscape of urban decay, racial tension, a hurricane 
        about to hit the city, and shaking her head: “Dear Dear,” indeed. In this 
        world, the city has become a Disneyland façade, complete with “natives,” 
        in which the city’s functions have been commandeered for the comfort of 
        tourists. “Street signs are moved around, and streets renamed so that 
        tourists walk only sanctioned loops. The loops concentrate site; representative

        For example, the “war at home” evokes the struggle both by and against

          using the voice of a white man, Jimmy Monroe, which enabled him to draw 
          a few red herrings across the trail and resolve what appeared at the

          writer and demonstrating that it is possible for an African American 
          to go beyond ghetto experience…The editors deliberately and relentlessly 
          erased the tenderer and more artistic aspects to turn Himes’s manuscript 
          into a hard-boiled prison novel. For many publishers in those days, 
          the only place where the black man was not an invisible man was in a
