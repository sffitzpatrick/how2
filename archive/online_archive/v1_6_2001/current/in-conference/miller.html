      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 
        1988, the Hungarian media artist, filmmaker, and sociologist Péter Forgács 
        has assembled the Private Hungary documentary series, now twelve films 
        from a collection of home movie stock dating back to the 1930s and up 
        to the present. These films draw upon the Private Film and Photo Archives 
        in Budapest, which comprises about 300 hours of home movies, predominantly 
        from the pre-World War II period, and an additional forty hours of interviews 
        with the relatives of the amateur filmmakers who shot the footage.  Most 
        are collaborations with Hungary’s most important minimalist composer, 
        Tibor Szemzõ.  Forgács’s films have aired on Hungarian television and 
        in international film festivals and art exhibitions; he was recently a 
        resident fellow at the Getty Institute in southern California.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reassembling 
        the cinematic traces of a world irreparably altered by the passing of 
        time and the dislocations of Central European history, Forgács movingly 
        evokes the pathos of individuals conducting their everyday, domestic lives 
        against the backdrop of historical events they can only partially comprehend.  
        At the same time, he reflects on the almost miraculous facticity of the 
        film material itself, its survival from the destruction that must have 
        engulfed thousands of amateur films for every one preserved in his archive. 
        As Joanne Richardson writes, Forgács “has given the private archive project 
        an ontological dimension, turning it into a reflection on the nature of 
        memory, the construction of history, and the phenomenology of film-making 
        itself.”<span> <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> </span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        ontological thickness of the film material is perhaps most spectacularly 
        evoked by his 1996 film, <i>Free Fall,</i> and its 1997 successor, <i>The 
        Maelstrom</i>, both of which document the story of Jewish families almost 
        up to the point at which they are incarcerated in concentration camps.  
        One reaction to these films is simple astonishment at the sheer will to 
        register daily life on film, even in situations of extreme danger and 
        hardship.  In the case of <i>Free Fall, </i>the survival of the film stock 
        parallels the remarkable survival of the filmmaker and his wife in the 
        camps; Forgács has recently made a follow-up that picks up their story 
        from their reunion after the war until the wife’s death in the 1950s.  
        In <i>The Maelstrom,</i> in contrast, the film becomes a posthumous memorial 
        to the filmmaker, who died in the camps.  The effect in both cases is 
        to set up an emotionally charged resonance between film, lived time, memory, 
        history, and death.  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        1992, Forgács made two films that utilize the same home movie materials, 
        but that stand out for their explicitly reflexive, metapoetic handling 
        of them and their innovative formal structure: <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> 
        and <i>Bourgeois Dictionaries</i>.  I will be concentrating my comments 
        on the former film, which arranges the film images against a backdrop 
        of quotes from Wittgenstein.  <i>Bourgeois Dictionaries, </i>however, 
        also explores “linguistic” and quasi-mathematical frameworks for presenting 
        the images, reflecting in a Wittgensteinian fashion on relations of saying 
        and seeing, names and pictures.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About 
        thirty minutes long, <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus </i>is organized into seven 
        sections, formally alluding to Wittgenstein’s book, which offers seven 
        basic propositions and a series of elucidating comments that are numerically 
        subordinated to the main propositions.  Although Wittgenstein’s words 
        and to a more limited extent his photographic image and his handwriting 
        are constant presences in the film, <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus </i>is neither 
        a wittily artful biographical fiction like Derek Jarman’s very different 
        <i>Wittgenstein</i>  nor a typical documentary presentation of Wittgenstein’s 
        philosophy.  Instead, it might be characterized as a poetic montage of 
        verbal and visual documents that resonate with the historical pathos of 
        the Central European, bourgeois, Jewish life-world that Wittgenstein shared 
        with the filmed subjects of Forgács found footage.   In this sense, Forgács’s 
        film might be understood as an historical critique of the Wittgenstein’s 
        <i>Tractatus</i>, revealing its schisming of the subject between the logically 
        speakable and the mystically inexpressible to be a profoundly <i>historical 
        </i>artifact of a specific culture, to be traceable to the contradictions 
        of everyday life of Central European Jewry in the twentieth century.  
        In addition, I want to suggest, <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> can be understood 
        as a metapoetics of the Private Hungary documentary project as a whole.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
        discerns in Forgács’s film very little of the Wittgenstein who, rightly 
        or wrongly, is taken to be the inspirer, first, of Vienna Circle logical 
        positivism and, later, of British ordinary language philosophy.  Rather, 
        the Wittgenstein of Forgács’s film is the theorist of the facticity of 
        the world as it is (“what is the case”), its composition from matters-of-fact 
        and the relations between them.  In analogy to the filmmaker himself, 
        this Wittgenstein is concerned with picturing the world in the arrangement 
        of his statements and with understanding the conditions of their meaningfulness.  
        He is the explorer of the limits of language and the indicator of a configurational 
        and gestural realm that can been seen rather than said.  He is the paradoxical 
        voice of an aesthetic and ethical realm that can only be pointed to in 
        silence, because nothing sensical can be said of either suffering or pleasure.  
        He is a mystical witness to the ontological wonder that the world is and 
        that it is in order as it is.  He is the author of that <i>Tractatus </i>that 
        Ernest Gellner characterized as a “poem to solitude,”<span><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> 
        [3]</a></span> a poetic assemblage of gnomic propositions that poignantly 
        bespeak, in their very austere and ascetic denial of worldliness, the 
        solipsistic isolation of the early Wittgenstein.  And finally, metonymically, 
        lacking a national-cultural home and seeking it despairingly in logic, 
        war, labor, and eventually everyday speech, he is a singular instance 
        of the Central European Jewish bourgeoisie that constitutes Forgács’s 
        primary focus in his documentary explorations.</font></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">*

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Everything 
        we see could also be otherwise,” Wittgenstein wrote, in arguing against 
        an <i>a priori</i>   order of things.  “Everything we can describe at 
        all could also be otherwise.”  Forgács quotes this passage in the film 
        and has identified it as a kind of summation of his documentary project.  
        Wittgenstein glosses his refusal of an <i>a priori</i> order as a denial 
        of a psychological agency that lends necessity to the fact that things 
        appear as they do; he emphasizes instead the sheer contingency of the 
        world’s advent to a subject.  That subject, he notes, is not part of that 
        world, a “constitutive ego,” as phenomenologists would have it, but is 
        rather a non-psychological edge at which the interpenetration of world 
        and thinking reaches its limit.  “Here,” Wittgenstein concludes, “we see 
        that solipsism strictly carried out coincides with pure realism.  The 
        I in solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and there remains the 
        reality co-ordinated with it” (<i>Tractatus</i> 5.64).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        editor of found film footage, Forgács is dealing with traces of a visual 
        world that he cannot enter except at the tangent of the film material 
        itself.  He is dealing with an intimate world that he was literally never 
        in and can never directly see.  As archivist and editor, he is the non-psychological 
        limit of that past world’s factual advent from possibility to actuality 
        in the present.   Through the bracketing of his own person involved in 
        the use of found footage, Forgács tends towards a “pure realism” in Wittgenstein’s 
        sense—a realism based less on the mimetic veracity of the images, which 
        like all home movies are often quite contrived and “hammy,” than on the 
        factical authenticity of the film material itself, from which the living 
        subject of experience has withdrawn into death, anonymity, or oblivion. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
        the same time, however, neither the original filmmaking nor Forgács’s 
        editing appear anything like “impersonal.”  On the contrary, there is 
        a strongly “personal” quality to many of the images.  The viewer is led 
        to ask: Who is that?  In what relation do these people stand?  To whom 
        is she speaking?  What caused him to glance away a moment?  Is he angry 
        or just bored?  For whom is she waiting?  Why does he look sad?  In many 
        cases, we simply can’t discover it from the filmed footage.  Though perhaps 
        the archived interviews suggest some clues, many times probably not even 
        the filmed subjects themselves could tell us now.  The films evoke a zone 
        of irreducible hiddenness that lies beyond the limits of the visually 
        manifest, a perhaps permanent “solipsistic” veiling of whatever personal 
        meanings and motivations the images might once have possessed.  What is 
        left is only a set of signs that can be seen, and as seen, seem to possess 
        a meaningful character; but what they mean, one can’t really say.  It 
        is as if the answers to the questions that the images evoke were held 
        in a space of privacy—but a paradoxically impersonal space, a privacy 
        belonging to no one in particular.</font></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">*  
        *  *</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Throughout 
        his film, Forgács offers a world in which language and image, word and 
        diagram, object and movement, sound and silence are complexly and enigmatically 
        intertwined.  The different dimensions in which meaning “takes place” 
        come in contact at only at shifting tangents rather than aligning in relations 
        of correspondence.  Meaning appears constantly—it can be seen—but resists 
        being stated in proposition form.  Forgács is as concerned to depict this 
        resistance of his material to speakable meaning, to map out its edges 
        and limits, as he is to motivate and formulate meaningful interpretations 
        of it.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus, 
        for example, Forgács overlays a geometrical diagram on the image of a 
        fallen horse and a clocklike diagram over the image of a topless woman 
        at a sewing machine.  Such juxtapositions demonstrate not that the world 
        can be reduced to a “logical picture,” but rather precisely the incommensurability 
        of the various ways in which the world can be apprehended.  For example, 
        one might ethically commiserate with the animal’s suffering or the woman’s 
        naked toil or, alternatively, aesthetically appreciate the abstract curve 
        of the woman’s moving arm and its contrary direction to circular rotation 
        of the sewing machine wheel.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Similarly, 
        words and letters appear in the urban environment in this final section 
        in ways that emphasize the indefiniteness and mobility of their meanings.  
        Words and letters may signify in a quasi-algebraic way within formal systems 
        of relations; for example, the letter G appears on a streetcar, indicating 
        a segment of the urban transportation network.   They may give names of 
        stores and people, which refer them to systems of kinship and the division 
        of labor.  They may also serve to cue practical functions such as forbidding 
        or inviting certain actions.  The word “Szabad” (free), for example, appears 
        in the final chapter in the window of a moving taxi from which street 
        scenes were shot.  This word signifies something humbly practical in this 
        context: that the taxi will pick up riders.  But seen, for example, in 
        another context, perhaps on a banner in the streetcar pushed down the 
        tracks by the people of occupied Budapest in Istvan Szabo’s film <i>25 
        Fireman Street,</i> it could mean something quite different.  Its meaning 
        holds for a world in which it is contingently the case, but it could be 
        otherwise.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Earlier 
        in the film, Forgács quotes Wittgenstein that language clothes the thought 
        in such a way that the thought cannot be recognized from the clothes.  
        Another detail in this final section refers this Wittgensteinian disjunction 
        of thinking and speaking, of seeing and saying, to the images of Forgács’s 
        own film and his editorial “tailoring” of them to quotations from Wittgenstein.   
        As if recalling this passage and providing a self-reflexive illustration, 
        Forgács includes in the final section a bizarre, masked sandwich-board 
        man who is walking around the city carrying words that literally cloth 
        and hide his body.  The signboard, which one can barely make out, reads 
        “A láthatatlan ember visszatér”—The Return of the Invisible Man.  Like 
        a cinematic ghost who walks the streets of Budapest, he is clothed in 
        the Hungarian language, advertising for a film made up of images synchronized, 
        originally, with English words.</font></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">*  
        *  *</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Forgács’s 
        interest in the non-correspondence of the visual and the verbal extends 
        to a different Wittgensteinian conception of documentary mimesis.  In 
        the opening propositions of the <i>Tractatus</i> , Wittgenstein introduces 
        a range of terms including “Ding” (thing), “Gegenstand” (object), “Sache” 
        (a matter, an affair), “Tatsache” (fact),  and “Sachverhalt” (which I’ll 
        translate, rejecting C.K. Ogden’s confusing “atomic facts,” as “state 
        of affairs”).   “The world is the totality of facts,” Wittgenstein writes, 
        “not of things.”   And: “The world divides [better translated “dissolves,” 
        “decomposes”] into facts” (<i>Tractatus </i>1.2). A state of affairs is 
        a “combination of objects (affairs, things)” (<i>Tractatus </i>2.01).  
        Facts (Tatsache) are composed of states of affairs (Sachverhalte), which 
        either exist (positive fact) or do not exist (negative fact). Facts, therefore, 
        are combinations of objects, affairs, and things as viewed in light of 
        their existence or non-existence.  And the world can be analyzed down 
        to these existing or non-existing combinations, not down to objects, things, 
        and affairs as such.  It is the facts—existing or non-existing combinations--not 
        objects, things, and affairs that we picture: “Wir machen uns Bilder der 
        Tatsachen” (We make to ourselves pictures of facts.) (<i>Tractatus </i>2.1).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        don’t wish to get lost here in the complexities of tractatian semantics, 
        nor am I suggesting that Forgács is simply depicting or applying ideas 
        derived from Wittgenstein.  I do, however, think that formal attention 
        to Forgács’s composition of images in <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> suggests 
        his Wittgensteinian rekeying of the question of documentary realism.  
        To formulate it broadly, Forgács shifts documentary realism away from 
        a conception of correspondences of the film image to an object, event, 
        person, or social category (Sachen, Dinge, Gegenstände) in favor of an 
        analogical circumscription of cultural, historical, and anthropological 
        “facts” (Tatsachen) and “states of affairs” (Sachverhalte).   The existence 
        of a configuration—its factuality, its facticity of “being the case” in 
        the world as captured at the moment of filming—<i>is</i> what is presented 
        by Forgács’s film in the first instance.  Only derivatively is he interested 
        in the object, event, or matter as such, the names of people and occasions 
        that may, in fact, be lost in time.  The resistance of the image to identifiable 
        meaning, thus, is not merely a matter of missing information, as if watching 
        the film with an archival finding aid would yield a better viewing.  It 
        is the very lack of identifiable reference in many of the scenes that 
        allows its analogical linkage to other images to be made, thus revealing 
        a common cultural / historical / social “fact” beneath continually varying 
        object, things, affairs.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        demonstrate this point, I have identified three prominent image-clusters 
        from <i>Wittgenstein Tractatus</i> that illustrate how Forgács’s selection 
        of materials represents contingent instantiations of basic situations.  
        In other words: how through different “objects,” he presents the same 
        ”facts.”  These clusters include:</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:
200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        scenes of animal suffering</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:
200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        scenes of dancing</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:
200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        scenes of transportation</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
        can relate, as I’ve already suggested, the scenes of suffering and of 
        dancing to the limits of representability that Wittgenstein assigns to 
        the ethical and aesthetic realms respectively.  Neither suffering nor 
        pleasure falls, for Wittgenstein, within the <i>logical</i> form of the 
        world and hence remains unspeakable, though silently apprehensible.  The 
        scenes of transportation are less easily interpretable in this sense, 
        but relate to the more general problems of relating the world as seen 
        and said.  What all these elements have in common, however, is that they 
        trace out relations in space that are tangential to propositional language.  
        If, however, movement is integral to the film medium, then we may read 
        Forgács’s concentration on these variably realized “facts” as making the 
        case for the ethical and aesthetic relevance of the documentary cinema, 
        as providing a crucial way of silently acknowledging that which it is 
        not possible to speak.</font></p>

        conclusion, I will refer to one brief sequence from Forgács’s extraordinary 
        addition to the Private Hungary series from the same year as he made <i>Wittgenstein 
        Tractatus</i>, the film<i> Bourgeois Dictionaries.</i>   In this film, 
        he moves through a series of topically organized images linked to a set 
        of words alphabetically marked.  These range from “jeweler” to  “life” 
        to “annexation” and “amnesia.”   Together they illustrate, in this index-like 
        form, the drift of Hungarian society towards collaboration and Nazi occupation, 
        with its connotations of both bureaucratic classification and racial exclusion.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        one particularly moving sequence, Forgács edits together a series of images 
        of a Jewish man in a number of different scenes, in which his appearance 
        is captioned with the logical variable “x.”  Throughout the sequence, 
        the man is referred to simply as “X ur” (Mr. X).  Mr. X is seen in a variety 
        of settings, from domestic to business to ceremonial occasions.  Towards 
        the end of the sequence, however, Forgács interpolates one of the more 
        standard “dictionary entries” of the rest of the—“Jewish labor service,” 
        “train”—film which suggests Mr. X’s ultimate fate as a victim of Nazi 
        racial policy.  Here Forgács’s historical “fact” becomes truly representative, 
        a picture of a world in which “what was the case” could have been otherwise, 
        but in the historical case we know, thousands of people stood in the factual 
        place of “Mr. X.”</font></p>
