        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          an increasingly technologised world varying degrees of liveness are already 
          in production. Our relationship to events is bound up with their representation 
          across a range of media including film, video and the internet. The work 
          of Leslie Scalapino, Fiona Templeton and Carla Harryman articulates a 
          complex investigation of the live subject in relation to the time of event 
          and to the time of writing itself. These relationships are acutely bound 
          up with an exploration of event as representation—representations which 
          paradoxically might occur simultaneously with their ‘live’ counterparts. 
          The term ‘degrees of liveness’ is not meant to imply that one degree is 
          more ‘live’ than another but that in each of the works considered the 
          temporal moment of the live cannot necessarily be fixed as occurring entirely 
          within the present moment. Through their work Scalapino, Templeton and 
          Harryman critique the idea of a monolithic live by unsettling the temporal 
          expectations of both the audience and subject.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          1992 L.A. riots and <i>The Disasters of War </i>(1811-12), a series of 
          etchings by Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) hover obliquely 
          over Leslie Scalapino’s play, <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> The play’s tangential 
          relation to these two sources raises questions concerning the construction 
          of the live subject in relation to events, specifically events that are 
          transmitted to the subject through live and electronic media. The play 
          looks at the way in which the ‘live’ subject might be constituted through 
          its relationship to the ‘technology’ of event. Both sources function as 
          a kind of lens through which to re-write/re-view the discourse of event, 
          the discourse of the live and electronically mediated subject. Scalapino 
          describes the play’s performance as “images occurring in a rhythm”(5). 
          “Images” in rhythm rather than words. This mimics the acute mediatisation 
          of images that accompanied the L.A. riots, and it also relates to the 
          hybrid nature of the play itself which includes directions for slide projections, 
          taped and live voices and characters ‘real’ and imaginary—many of the 
          visual techniques used by the media to ‘transmit’ the L.A. riots to those 
          inside and outside the city. The play calls for a paratactic form of reading 
          that posits meaning in the relationships between blocks of words and their 
          repetition. Scalapino describes these images as constituting narrative, 
          as “occurring in a rhythm of presentation as if ‘not planned’ as, but 
          are, elements of a linear plot...”(5). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          sequencing of images relates to Goya’s eighty five etchings, <i>The Disasters 
          of War</i> (1811-12). Each etching depicts a different view of the ongoing 
          guerrilla conflict between French troops and their Spanish opponents in 
          the wake of Napoleon’s occupation of Spain. <i>The Disasters</i> depict 
          a squalid and grotesque vision of humanity; rape, murder, mutilation of 
          corpses and the abandonment of children against a backdrop of the effects 
          of famine. Each plate bears a caption, and sometimes an observation about 
          what is taking place in the design; occasionally, Goya adds a moral or 
          an epigram: “with reason or without (rightly or wrongly); “the same;” 
          “and are like Wild Beasts;” “for this you were born;” “treat them and 
          then on again;” “bitter presence.” “I saw this,” reads the caption to 
          one of Goya’s etchings but what does this mean? Is it an inscribing of 
          the presence of the ‘live’ subject? And what exactly is this when considered 
          in relation to representations made <i>after</i> the event. Like Scalapino 
          he is writing from the ‘live’ standpoint of a subject who has experienced 
          some of the events, (hence “I saw this”) but many of the things that he 
          depicts have been transmitted to him, by word of mouth, by other sketchers, 
          just as the events of the L.A. riots have been mediated to Scalapino ‘live’ 
          via the television, via the newspapers. The live subject’s “I saw this” 
          is a tissue of varying degrees of liveness that have occurred over a period 
          of time. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fred 
          Licht compares <i>The Disasters</i> to twentieth century news photography 
          both in terms of content and in terms of material processes: “both are 
          almost infinitely reproducible, both reproduce imagery to black and white, 
          both are created by physical change wrought on the surface of a plate, 
          and both are meant to be broadcast very widely and at small expense”(134). 
          This is also true of writing itself, infinitely reproducible, in black 
          and white, made by physical changes to a surface, broadcast widely and 
          at small expense. This connection between etching, photography and writing 
          implies a direct relationship to the ‘live’ event and the performative 
          role of the subject or subjects in that event. It foregrounds a possibility 
          for writing in relation to performance that seems to stand in opposition 
          to Peggy Phelan’s definition of live performance as that which is not 
          reproducible. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Scalapino’s 
          writing presents ‘liveness’ as it is experienced by the subject in an 
          acutely mediatised society which is always ‘live’ but also infinitely 
          reproducible. This is not to confuse the idea of a series of gradations 
          of liveness with a discussion of the witnessing an event ‘at first hand,’ 
          gradations of liveness emerge at precisely the moment that the possibility 
          of representation comes into play which might be before, after or during 
          the event itself. Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> seems to explore positionings 
          of the writer/artist in relation to events mediated through electronic 
          communication systems and surveillance. Scalapino’s work, like Goya’s 
          <i>Disaster</i> series does not add up to one ‘version’ or perspective 
          of events and this is linked to the fact that both Scalapino and Goya 
          articulate ‘liveness’ in reproducible media. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gradations 
          or degrees of liveness are intimated on a number of levels within Scalapino’s 
          text: slides, voice-overs and video mediate the time of the subject. One 
          of the recurring images projected during the play is that of greyhounds 
          running, “in a blur of motion as if turning on each other in air”: </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her introduction Scalapino relates these images to the unfolding of the

          The movement induces a greyhound flying curled legless”(8):</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          gradations of liveness problematise an easy definition of the time of 
          event. Like the stills of the projected photographs, the voice-overs overlay 
          the live performance with another present, a live recorded speaking voice 
          that is re-played as a frozen moment of previous action. This mirrors 
          the construction of the play itself which is an overlapping of differing 
          moments. The voice-over also ‘reads’ projected slides of texts (but of 
          course she can’t read it at the same time as we, the audience see it). 
          There is a gap between her reading and our reading of the events, yet 
          the play assimilates them at the same time as drawing our attention to 
          it through the incorporation of a recorded ‘live’ voice. The overlapping 
          of live action with a previously recorded image or sound is also reversed 
          as projected images are themselves overlaid with other projected images: 
          “Another slide of rotting coyote landscape collaged with lotuses”(18). 
          The images of past actions are already themselves collaged and overlaid 
          with others which mimics the ebb and flow between memory, fantasy and 
          history. It also focuses on the power of the recording medium; writing, 
          memory, photography to themselves fabricate: “Memory’s being involuntary 
          and repeats things that do not occur—we have to do that—so that its motions 
          are the same as there. (She exits)”(33). The projections are also used 
          to refer to the intended site of the text as a serial in the newspaper: 
          “Slide of greyhound. Then slide in Japanese of the following passage, 
          as if vertical panels of newspaper columns.” Again there is a folding 
          of the outside in—the intended site of the writing becomes a space within 
          the live performance itself rather than being the container, the outside 
          frame, the outer boundary of the work, it is a cell within it. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          “Of the Refrain” Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari describe the way in 
          which sound and rhythm mark boundaries of territorial space and designate 
          order within that space as well as create nodes and networks beyond it. 
          The rhythm of images in <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> also mimics the space of the 
          city, a repetition of enclaves, discrete units for living in, barricading 
          oneself in, breaking out of, returning to. This territorial space is a 
          milieu, a milieu that is never static but which is “vibratory,” a piece 
          of space-time that resonates with its own refrain, its own periodic repetition 
          of itself as a subject.(313) The vibratory quality of the space-time block 
          is not limited to sound, “we call a refrain any aggregate of matters of 
          expression that draws a territory and develops into territorial motifs 
          and landscapes (there are optical, gestural, motor, etc., refrains).(323) 
          Rhythm equals plot, plot equals rhythm but these are not separate from 
          the subject itself; rhythm equals plot equals subject. A block of space-time 
          like the subject is coded to repeat its refrain and it is the variations 
          of this periodic repetition that constitutes itself and what is apart 
          from it. “Transcoding or transduction” is how Deleuze and Guattari refer 
          to the way in which the block of space-time that has been constituted 
          by the refrain can be built into or leads directly to another, that is 
          either dissipated or constituted in the exchange.(313) It is like a map 
          of a space, a plot which does not unfold in one direction from ‘a - b’ 
          but folds and unfolds, only to fold again and continue, plotting itself 
          unfolding: “<b>Dead Souls: </b>Every paragraph—sometimes a line is a paragraph—is 
          by itself. As if the segments are an expanse, or settings of separate 
          compartments. Which don’t blur into each other”(63). Like hypertextual 
          links or the rhythms of the refrain Scalapino’s subjects are self-generating 
          and produce others in periodic dissipation and exchange.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Goya’s 
          <i>Disasters</i> likewise represent a change in the usual relations of 
          space and time and therefore to the figuring of the live subject. There 
          is no fixed centre in Goya’s vision, “we cannot take our bearings in the 
          directionless world he shows us”(Licht, 141) and we are made emphatically 
          aware of the fragmentary nature of our perception, the fractional moment 
          of the “I saw this.” Similarly the cropping of the images means that “in 
          opposition to the Renaissance tradition, we are made aware of spaces that 
          are larger and possibly more important than the space we have actually 
          before us.” Our eyes are impelled beyond the frame of representation. 
          There is no containable ‘live’ moment. This can be compared to the excess 
          of viewpoints and overspill of event that is found in Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s 
          L.A. </i>:</font></p>

          visual image is at once previous to the event and the productive site 
          of fantasy, in which to ‘perform’ an event. She seems to be implying that 
          the transmission of the event and its occurrence are one and the same 
          thing. Ads, like riots do not occupy foreclosed spaces but spill out over 
          into that which is already spilling out of itself in various directions.

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Leslie 
          Savan makes a similar point in her analysis of the L.A. “Buy it riots”: 
          “Crisis calls for commercials...Ad age expanded the mission, running front-page 
          editorial—“A call to admen: Help stop riots.” It implored companies (like 
          sneaker firms) to make anti-violence ads...”(Savan:128), and in effect 
          to become central points of focus around which to re-organise order. Scalapino 
          refuses such totalizing measures, no controlling perspective ties the 
          elements together. There is no compositional climax that tells us that 
          the events described and enacted have importance in terms of a decipherable 
          meaning that can be measured against an ascertainable moral scale of values. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Goya’s 
          <i>Disaster </i>series, like Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> challenges 
          the compositional schemes of four centuries of Renaissance-Baroque tradition 
          in which a distinction is made between the central and the peripheral.  
          As Licht points out, “The most casual view of Dutch landscape or the most 
          neutral still life is still so articulated that there is a distinct center 
          at which the expressive potential of the composition is most compact. 
          Other areas of the painting, though they may be painted with equal care, 
          are ancillary”(144). Goya rejects this centrality of focus by suppressing 
          backgrounds/landscapes that are extraneous to the composition and this 
          has the effect of potentialising the whole field of the composition, “every 
          form within this field, whether it be a void or a volume, plays a part 
          that becomes progressively more equal in value to every other form within 
          the same field”(145). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          equality of forms within a field is a characteristic of Scalapino’s play. 
          There is no one perspective position or point of view which is privileged, 
          even the voices of the characters seem soluble into the elements of that 
          they seem to be witnessing and describing: “Presentation is the visual 
          events spoken, such as the sumo floating on the ocean horizon, being real 
          scrutiny of the vertical and horizontal line, of our vision as per the 
          set itself”(5). In this way, <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> presents layers of merging 
          and re-emerging planes of fantasy and reality that transcode and transduce 
          into series of multiple perspectives and subject positions that extend 
          not only laterally, but also vertically as the subject embeds itself at 
          different depth points. This merging posits a spatial configuration of 
          time which is similar to that which Deleuze finds in his description of 
          the time-image with its “coexistence of distant durations, or of levels 
          of duration; a single event can belong to several levels: the sheets of 
          the past coexist in a non-chronological order”(1988, xii). One of the 
          effects of this spatialisation is the difficulty of getting outside the 
          work in order to find a stable point from which to comment on it. Instead 
          the reader is returned inwards, folded back in.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Visually, 
          one sees in apparently inner captions. We don’t know what writing is,”(7) 
          claims Scalapino in her introduction to the work. The use of the image 
          of the caption again links her to Goya but in Scalapino’s work the caption 
          is inside. The verbal as merged with the visual, it is no longer separate. 
          Susan Sontag’s description of the caption in photography calls it “the 
          missing voice,” adding, “it is expected to speak for truth. But even an 
          entirely accurate caption is only one interpretation, necessarily a limiting 
          one, of the photograph to which it is attached. And the caption-glove 
          slips on so easily”(108). Scalapino allows no such reassuring gap between 
          caption and image, to see visually in inner captions implies an absorption 
          of writing into seeing: “I saw this,” becomes the opening up of the question, 
          ‘how’ this seeing was done? By posing this question Scalapino is critiquing 
          the way in which it is not only the world and its events which are mediated 
          for us through language, technology and economics but also our responses 
          to them, as if they had already occurred. </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          relationship of the ‘live’ subject to its physical geography of place 
          and site is becoming increasingly redefined through technology. In their 
          recent book, <i>Information Techtonics</i>, Mark Wilson and Kenneth Corey 
          assert “The ability of land and place to define our identity is also changing 
          with the replacement of the physical by the electronic”(1). The language 
          of Fiona Templeton’s <i>You - The City </i>seems to assimilate this change. 
          The film of <i>You - The City</i> is a record of her theatre project in 
          New York in 1988. In the theatre piece that Templeton wrote and directed, 
          actors were positioned in different locations around the city of New York 
          and the audience made an appointment for a particular time in the day 
          when he or she would arrive at a small office and be led away with one 
          of the actors, the audience member would follow the actor to the next 
          rendezvous point where they would meet the next speaker/actor who would 
          talk to them before taking them to the next point and so on. These rendezvous 
          were quite literally that, a rounding on you in a poetic monologue that 
          directs the ‘client’ through the streets of the city. The first line of 
          the entire film is, “If I could tell you that you are alive.” And subsequently 
          each line in the film up until the significant changeover scene contains 
          the word “you,” dramatising an exchange of “you for you.” The way in which 
          the film is recorded replaces the ‘live’ ‘you’ with the camera, thus opening 
          a space for the audience to take the place of the live subject, as if 
          <i>they</i> were there, live. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
          work can be linked to that of the work of the situationists, who during 
          the 1960’s advocated the production or construction of situations that 
          would break down the boundary between theatrical and non-theatrical space, 
          and integrate players and audience (Sadler: 105):</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
          work involves the creation of a network of communication that takes place 
          alongside those that already exist in the city. At the same time Templeton 
          accentuates the artifice of the constructed situation through the character’s 
          use of highly stylised/poetic language. <i>You  - The City</i> can be 
          read in terms of what the situationists would have called a detournment 
          of the usual networks of communication and exchange. Whereas the Situationists 
          had plans to replace the stairways in Piranesi’s etchings with lifts and 
          recast the street dustbins in ivory, Templeton presents a detournment 
          of encounter. In translation, detournment carries with it more than a 
          sense of turning aside from or of a diversion, it also includes the sense 
          of re-routing or hijacking, embezzlement, misappropriation, corruption 
          (Sadler 17). In Templeton’s film of <i>You - The City</i>, the audience 
          member loses control not only of where they will go but who they are;  
          “I didn’t say your name to tell you it but because it is not mine.” The 
          detournment of the routes through the city is paralleled by the detournements 
          of language itself.  The spectator/audience member actively participates 
          to create an urban dynamic that is outside the drives of capital and bureaucracy. 
          This itself is a risky position for the live-subject, “a trap would feel 
          safer” intones one of the speakers. The camera as a point of focus is 
          itself vulnerable to the environment of the city, the camera crew is ambushed 
          by lolly-sucking children trying to get in on the frame of the shots, 
          shouting “Was I on television...?” The uncertainty of the camera as participant 
          is captured in the jerky angles and foregrounding of itself as a handheld 
          device that points to a space of an absent human presence that we as spectators 
          are encouraged to inhabit, it leaves a space for the new ‘I’ of the film 
          watcher to assume the space of the previous live-subject. There is also 
          a connection between route making and the construction of identity, for 
          both might lead to dead ends: “you must invent the truth,” in the face 
          of possibilities that are “red herrings.” The question of who is in control, 
          addresser or addressee is continually articulated just as who or what 
          the ‘I’ of addresser and addressee is, is continually re-adjusted. This 
          ‘I’ is repositioned through the discourse of the speakers who range from 
          seducers of the live-subject (“what shall I be for you”), to positers 
          of a jilted I, (“you want, you want the impossible”), a collusive ‘I’ 
          (“You’re my right hand in this”), a lost ‘I’ (“following gives you away”), 
          an ‘I’ that is filled with longing and fear (“who are you to be you, do 
          you have it in you?”), and a guilty transgressing ‘I’ (“after what has 
          passed between us you and I will not expect to see me again”).  None of 
          these ‘I’s are any more <i>authentic </i>than the other, no single one 
          is the <i>true</i> ‘live’ I. Instead Templeton’s text presents a split 
          and refracted live subject that appears to be filtered through endless 
          representations of itself. These constant refigurations of the ‘I,’ as 
          it overlaps, dissolves and is successively reconstituted, parallel the 
          use of projections and taped voices in Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s LA.</i> </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
          text, like the situationists’ maps, works by describing an urban navigational 
          system that operates independently from the dominant patterns of circulation. 
          She draws attention to the routes of economic exchange, (“who gave you 
          to who?”) that dominate our networks of communication and identity through 
          the drama of the relationship of the pronouns to the city, (“you’re not 
          myself and that leaves you no one to say yes to”). This is the politics 
          of what the situationists called “drift”—i.e. a re rerouting of the subject 
          according to the chance and pleasure of encounter. Templeton’s work can 
          be read as a kind of situationist re-inscribing of the names of streets. 
          The city itself is also a live-subject, a body that is itself being re-inscribed 
          through the setting up of alternative networks of communication. These 
          alternative networks refigure the habitual journey from A to B by making 
          the journey, rather than the final destination, the focal point of the 
          text. Implicated in all these networks is a live-subject (the ‘you’ of 
          the audience) that is actively de-familiarised from itself: “wouldn’t 
          you like to know what it is like to see through someone else’s eyes?,” 
          “I wanna be you to you and I want you to be you,” before being urged to 
          take responsibility for this ‘you,’ this “shadow that is attached to the 
          body.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although 
          the version of the play ultimately comes to an end it is far from being 
          a closed text—the live-subject is “released” back into the city, the same 
          space that moments before had been channelled into a different use. Language, 
          like the city is re-routed and through becoming involved in the process 
          of the film as participants, we as ‘live’ audience are also re-routed 
          and refigured. Near the end of the film the ‘live-subject’ is asked to 
          make a telephone call, “say, I to you” the performer tells the client 
          and this call is put through to another ‘live-subject’ about to embark 
          on the performance. The live-subject of the audience communicates directly 
          to a past self, another participant at a different stage on the route. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
          mediation both of the time of the event via the telephone and the virtual 
          filmic space of the ‘live-subject’ through electronic technology parallels 
          Stephen Graham’s formulation of, “Actor-Network Theories.” ANT emphasise 
          how particular social institutions and human actors “enroll” pieces of 
          technology, machines, as well as documents, texts, and money, into “actor-networks”(23). 
          There is a direct relationship between Templeton’s figuration of her project 
          as a film that moves through, across and into the city to redefine the 
          identity of the live subject and contemporary metaphors of the city used 
          to conceptualise a virtual geography of cyberspace.  In cyberspace an 
          Internet “point-of-presence” becomes a web site, on an information superhighway, 
          the satellite node becomes the teleport, the Bulletin Board system becomes 
          a virtual community or electronic neighbourhood. Web sites run by municipalities 
          become virtual cities located near electronic frontiers that are traversed 
          by web surfers, virtual travellers and electronic flaneurs.(9) Cyber-space 
          is in a way like a fragmented city; “‘Cyberspace,’” argues Graham, “therefore 
          needs to be considered as a fragmented, divided, and contested multiplicity 
          of heterogeneous infrastructures and actor-networks”(24). These are also 
          the qualities that Fiona Templeton highlights through her portrayal of 
          the city in relation to the live subject, who proceeds from fragmented 
          voice to voice, each of which contest the definition of ‘I’, ‘you,’ and 
          the city.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          statement by Templeton implies a relationship between the writer and the 
          reader or audience that is fraught with tension. Narrative figures as 
          the principle actant in the struggle here. The audience/reader wants a 
          story, they want blood but Templeton won’t give it to them until they 
          have given. She demands of them even as they demand of her, literally 
          baying for blood. For audience and reader there is “something dangerous 
          that looks like a story.(1985, 80) In the book version of <i>YOU - The 
          City,</i> Templeton tries to create a similar space for the reader as 
          she did for the ‘live’ you of the theatre version by transcribing the 
          conversations of the actors and the clients that took place during or 
          after the performance into a column of the text alongside the script, 
          which she refers to as the “unintendable.” The documentation of the event 
          becomes one in which the script of the original <i>YTC</i> is not extracted 
          from its moment of performance but accrues it as another voice, so the 
          text itself becomes its own narrative with implicit degrees or levels 
          of ‘liveness.’ This represents a juxtaposition of chance encounter and 
          pre-scripted event that was an essential component of the original piece:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So the

            throughout. Real situations and events, objectively; or with their own 
            intentions; or subjectively, for whoever was you; or whether you wanted 
            to speak as well as hear. Reception is also intention: what I meant 
            depended on what you thought I meant, and this was what I meant. If 
            I mean, I mean you. (vii)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here 
          Templeton compares the chance encounter of the play with the relationship 
          between the reader coming by chance upon a text, while surrounded by an 
          ongoing reality, very much as the clients and actors were in the performance 
          version of the text. She effectively invites the reader to participate, 
          “what I meant depended on what you thought I meant.” Meaning is the production 
          of the chance encounter between a scripted you and the ‘live’ subject 
          as reader, his/her previous selves already embedded as a layer of narrative 
          within the text. Templeton’s attitude to the text is one which keeps in 
          play the ‘live’ and provisional nature of the script as a direct address 
          to the ‘live’ subject who has metamorphosed into the reader: “The structure 
          allows the piece to be vertically apprehended and should perhaps be seen 
          as not rules but solutions, and questions I have of you”(viii). The notes 
          to the performer/reader also indicate a space for improvisation and so 
          allow for another degree of ‘liveness’ within the text. Each performer 
          is given a different strategy for improvisation if “it becomes necessary,” 
          i.e. if they are interrupted. Templeton’s only proviso is that “all improvised 
          lines must use the word ‘you’”(IYT, viii). By leaving her performers this 
          space for improvisation Templeton introduces a radical degree of liveness 
          into the text which allows for the interaction between client and performer. 
          This is quite different from the degree of liveness experienced in the 
          conventional theatrical space in which a stable text is delivered to a 
          passive audience. Ironically the effect of this is that the ‘you’ of the 
          live subject becomes the one constant of the performance at the same time 
          as it is the structure that is most radically challenged. What remains 
          constant is not the audience's passivity but their ability to influence 
          the course of the production, so the are kept in a state of perpetual 
          ‘liveness’ rather than being subsumed into a fourth wall.</font></p>

          Rauschenberg’s early works for theatre productions such as “Minutiae”(1954) 
          and “The Tower”(1957) and his later combine “Canyon”(1959), provide interesting 
          points of departure in relation to the participants of <i>You -  the City 
          </i>because of the way in which they fuse two apparently different media 
          from differing contexts. Rauschenberg uses materials such as paint and 
          canvas and found or every day materials such as wood, doors, household 
          rubbish, as well as more exotic junk, like the crow in “Canyon.” “Minutiae” 
          was actually made for use in performances of a ballet by Merce Cunningham 
          with music by John Cage and “The Tower” was created as part of the set 
          for the Paul Taylor Dance Company. The catalogue essay to an exhibition 
          of Rauschenberg’s work at the Tate in 1981 makes a parallel between the 
          relationship between the dance and the music and the combination of materials 
          in Rauschenberg’s constructions:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is 
            a distinctive feature of Cunningham’s dance that it is frequently performed 
            at the same time as the music without being determined by it or attempting 
            to illustrate it. Rauschenberg’s constructions exhibit the same kind 
            of dissociation but internally. The structural, incorporated and painted 
            elements seem to function independently of each other but simultaneously. 
            The constructions that were made for the dance theatre were characteristically 
            neither back-drops nor, quite, props. They approximate to the human 
            scale and were free-standing and self-contained, occupying the same 
            space as the dancers. When used on the stage they took on the role of 
            additional dancers. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          relates on a number of levels to Templeton’s project. <i>You - the City</i> 
          exists in relation to the world around it without trying to illustrate 
          it. Just as the elements that incorporated into the “combines” have been 
          part of everyday life before they were incorporated into the work to be 
          viewed, so the baseball court and the streets themselves are already part 
          of the everyday life of the viewer. The difference is that Rauschenberg 
          ultimately relies on the resonance of this former context to be carried 
          with the work once it is removed from the world and posited in a gallery. 
          Thus the simultaneity of elements described in the catalogue, “incorporated 
          and painted elements [that] seem to function independently of each other 
          but simultaneously” is quite different from the simultaneity of contexts 
          which Templeton’s project allows as the piece is not bracketed from the 
          world by use of a conventional theatrical space. This disassociation “internally” 
          that the writer notes in Rauschenberg’s work isn’t possible to locate 
          in Templeton because of the lack of ‘frame.’ At the same time it is there 
          because of the effect of the piece on its participants, “I remember standing 
          in that / kid’s playground, and / thinking, what a set. Like if / you 
          look at a painting by / Rauschenberg or Johns and / you have painted parts 
          and / then you have a real broom / stuck in, and you think, / what is 
          that doing there?”(54).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          might or might not be a direct reference to Rauschenberg’s “Tower” which 
          combines a broom, an umbrella, a light and a table in a painted structure. 
          These elements, like the clients and the performers in <i>You - The City</i>, 
          are a mix of “structural, incorporated and painted elements [that] seem 
          to function independently of each other but simultaneously.” In this sense 
          the performers and the clients become the elements of the combine and 
          the Changeover scene allows them to temporarily suspend their apparently 
          designated role as “incorporated or painted element.” Just as the best 
          of Rauschenberg’s combines start to open the question: which bits are 
          made and which found? Was it painted like that when he found it or did 
          he paint it? In the same way so the designated roles of the ‘live-subject’ 
          in <i>You - the City</i> blur. This figuration of the client as the readymade 
          element of a combine is emphasised by the fact that at the moment the 
          client leaves his/her performer and walks toward the two people, the performer 
          from that couple leaves his client: “Meanwhile, one of those two (in fact 
          Performer J, although the client will not be aware of this fact) leaves 
          the other and walks towards Performer H and her client.” The performer 
          and the client cross at the centre of the courts and the client moves 
          forward to join the other client:</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
          Templeton points out, “The success of this changeover scene rests on the 
          assumption that, judging from previous base scenes the client will take 
          the person he or she is approaching to be the performer of the next scene”(54). 
          Thus, the success of the scene is based on the misrecognition of the self 
          as other. The ‘I’ which is mistaken for ‘you.’ The readymade is itself 
          duped into thinking it is making its way toward its other when in fact 
          it is making its way toward a future version of itself. In the text of 
          the play the subsequent scene, Act II Scene iii - With Other, is itself 
          a blank, “The details of this scene are of course unknown”(56), an unknown 
          quantity of event and chance encounter between two live subjects that 
          cannot be scripted. Instead the people that had been performers watch 
          it and for a moment the relationship between client and performer is reversed.

            kinds of delays). The important thing then is just this matter of timing, 
            this snapshot effect, like a speech delivered on no matter what occasion 
            but at such and such an hour. It is a kind of rendezvous. </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          idea of the readymade as encounter relates to Templeton’s <i>You - the 
          City</i> in a number of ways. The play does not rely on the foreclosed 
          and pre-designated space of the theatre for its existence and is therefore 
          more open to chance and encounter as action. Like Duchamp, Templeton designates 
          the piece by planning to “inscribe a readymade” at a specific moment in 
          time at various points of this unbounded terrain. Just as the contexts 
          of Duchamp’s readymades are not limited to their art context so too Templeton’s 
          encounters are not confined to the theatre. The play is a series of simultaneous 
          speeches that cannot be heard at once by any one spectator/viewer/client 
          but each one represents “a kind of rendezvous” between the client and 
          the performer that also emphasises the “serial characteristic of the readymade.” 
          The appointment that the client is given to turn up at a particular time 
          at No. 1 Times Square marks the moment that the readymade of the piece 
          is inscribed and so comes into being.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          his book, <i>Kant After Duchamp</i>, Thierry de Duve extracts three essential 
          conditions for the readymade: the first of these is to specify the readymade, 
          the second is to inscribe the readymade and the third is to sign it. The 
          question of signing the readymade becomes an interesting problem in relation 
          to the play. The book is certainly signed, the words inside are attributed 
          to Fiona Templeton and therefore the words of the script and interestingly 
          the background noise and fallout of the conversations around the play 
          are also attributed to her. By designating the time and space of the readymade 
          she in a sense chooses to author this designated duration of space/time. 
          As I have suggested the work becomes more like one of Rauschenberg’s combines—elements 
          of found objects meeting in chance encounters with a scripted (painted 
          element). Just as Duchamp’s signature does not designate control over 
          the production of the objects (that they are often factory produced is 
          masked by their newly designated context), so Templeton’s appropriation 
          does not imply an authorship or control over all the words. This is interesting 
          to consider in the role of the artist as figured by Duchamp as a chooser 
          of what to designate as art rather than a maker: “once the idea of fabrication 
          has dropped off, the act of naming the object becomes a relevant condition 
          for specifying its encounter with an author who chooses it as much as 
          he is chosen by it...”(397). Interestingly the weight of this choice in 
          <i>You - the City</i> is shifted from the author (Templeton) to the client. 
          As “knowing broom” they designate themselves as readymades by choosing 
          to take part in the structure of the play. The “knowing broom” chooses 
          to designate itself as a readymade rather than waiting to be chosen by 
          the author/artist. </font></p>

          incorporates them into the book version of the play as if to emphasise 
          the integral importance of these ‘live’ blind-spots within the play in 
          which participants and the scenes and objects around them oscillate across 
          a number of contexts and meaning itself becomes unstable. The decision 
          to include these parts foregrounds the way in which both the written text 
          and the performed text rely on a process of accrual for the generation 
          of meaning. The interjections that accompany the written text are taken 
          from performances of the play in both New York and London as if to suggest 
          that the text will accrue more and more of these blind-spots as it moves 
          from site to site. In the performance the participant learns through participating

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          relationship between metaphor and the live and electronic subject’s relationship 
          to language is a central question in Carla Harryman’s collaboration with 
          the artist Amy Trachtenberg. Their text, “The Games” (http://www.markszine.com), 
          addresses the objectness of words. It is a game of whether words are things 
          and by extension, at what point the metaphor becomes the thing itself 
          both literally and figuratively. The ‘live subject’ must negotiate both 
          visual and verbal readings of text in order to proceed. In a sense, Harryman’s 
          project rejects this distinction between word and thing, and between language 
          and image while at the same time investigating its boundaries. In a similar 
          way she rejects the representation of a bounded subject embedded within 
          a wider objective framework of time-space. This hypertext project is also, 
          as the title suggests, a game with the aim, “to prevent, and if unable 
          to prevent, destroy triangulations, triads, triangles, trinities, threesomes, 
          the third party, the party line, closure.” It involves both visual and 
          verbal elements and extends Harryman’s interest in the possibilities of 
          the performativity of language on the page. As Harryman explains, “I use 
          the page to perform the dialogue, first, although I think of the page 
          also as a staging device.” This staging device further extends its possibilities 
          through the use of the interactive computer screen. The ‘live-subject’ 
          activates ‘live’ elements on the screen via clicking on the icons of “dice” 
          or an “ear” or a “seed pod” and this leads her/him to small blocks of 
          writing. The reading live subject participates directly in choosing the 
          pathway through the text while aware of other choices s/he could have 
          taken. There is a choice of whether to continue in a linear way, i.e. 
          to keep returning to the same icon (“dice,” “ear,” “pod”) or whether to 
          move between games (to go from “ear” to “dice” to “pod.”) This process 
          encourages the reader to become self-consciously aware of her relationship 
          to the reading of the text itself. It creates a space for a reader whose 
          degree of liveness is figured by a recognition of the radical possibility 
          of the subjunctive: <i>what if I were to click here...what if I might....would 
          it make a difference if I...</i></font></p>

          a way these observations on the work could be generalised to include most 
          projects carried out in a hypertext format. What interests me is the way 
          in which the writing itself raises questions about how it situates the 
          live and electronic ‘I’ at the level of actual as opposed to virtual language 
          use. Harryman’s text is an investigation of the relationship between performativity 
          and dialogue that occurs across discourses.  As she said in her 1996 interview 
          with Megan Simpson, “I like to put families of language in conversation 
          with each other, such as theoretical discourse, fiction, and nonsense.”

            underwater. Each player as the centre of the universe, watched the themes 
            unfold  in godly fashion. The weight of empires, the industrial revolution, 
            class struggle spread out from the images observed by the selves holding 
            the cards. The cards colonized continents. The players orchestrated 
            the rise and fall of civilizations.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          game and players become analogous to the live-subject that imagines he/she 
          is the “centre of the universe.” The very structure of the hyper-text 
          work calls this idea of the possibility of the unitary ‘live’ subject 
          into question. Layers of games begin to emerge, games within games that 
          are themselves representations of other games. And what is a game? A network 
          of players, a structure governing rules of behaviour, a hypertextual system 
          that is itself one node within the networks of the global communication 
          and exchange. Harryman raises the question of whether/if/should the ‘live-subject’ 
          play along with the route that has been laid out for them or skip  in 
          electronic jouissance—outside to other sites, or on to other games, networks, 
          structures of information. But this is not an easy option: “When a player 
          gets that card, the player usually folds for fear of betraying secret 
          partnerships outside the gaming room. If the player doesn’t fold, the 
          others around the table begin to sweat.” The author is herself inside 
          the web, she too is a live-subject struggling with and within the systems 
          of language and representation, “I can’t tell you how many times I have 
          tried myself; for instance, if you open the back door to irrationality, 
          the door can’t shut i.e. if the door shuts the you/one (the player, performer, 
          or agent) is/are again defeated.” It is this threshold between the semiotic 
          and the symbolic utterance that the subject negotiates with risk, and 
          in a sense this potential risk is the narrative of the live-subject in 
          action. As <i>The Game of Memorializing </i>makes clear, “The most feared 
          card is an image of abstract entanglements after the asphalt jungle has 
          peeled away.” Between words and things, between abstraction and the concrete, 
          the hypertext web of <i>The Games</i> invents a space for a live-subject 
          who is not a self.  This is not necessarily a negative dilemma, as suggested 
          in <i>The Game of Memorializing</i>, “There is no self. No ball supported 
          by gleaming muscles, no heroic dragging of singularity. But others connected 
          to her.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          discussing her plays, <i>The Third Man</i> and <i>La Quotidienne,</i> 
          Harryman illuminates this use of dialogic relationships between speakers 
          that contain selves within selves that are themselves caught in another 
          network of giving and receiving by saying: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’m interested 
            in a measure of dialogue in which, on the one hand, somebody asks a 
            question and somebody answers the question; on the other, the person 
            answering the question is only talking to herself, and the question 
            itself is only heard as a question she would ask herself, something 
            that would be a product of her own mind. Thus you ask me, “Do you like 
            roses?” And I answer with the question “Have you disposed of the fading 
            roses?” because I had been thinking about tossing the wilting cut flowers 
            out. Your question might be, “Do you like roses?” And my answer might 
            be, “I’ve been thinking about it off and on all morning.” It might in 
            a peculiar way sound like I’m answering a different question, not necessarily 
            knowing that what I’m answering and your question differ. (Simpson, 
            518)</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          a sense this type of language use in writing—to not necessarily know that 
          the answer may (note the use of the subjunctive again) end up differing 
          from the question—is the relationship between the theory and practice 
          of writing and reading the live and/or electronic subject; theoretically 
          there is the possibility to proceed in a  linear fashion, sticking to 
          the path offered by the successive texts in a <i>The Game of Moisture</i> 
          or in <i>The Game of Memorializing</i> but there is also the possibility 
          of veering off in other directions, to cross-reference to other games 
          within that game, to exit and remove oneself to another site-of-presence, 
          another place on the geographical map. What I want to stress is that although 
          these are formal options of hypertext they are not exclusively their domains. 
          Harryman in all her writings examines and inhabits a mode of hybridity 
          (as she says, “crossing boundaries is important if one wants to get a 
          sense of how to live”(524)) and it is this sense of how to live that radically 
          questions what Megan Simpson calls the “authenticity of the subject” through 
          its constant redefinitions in flux across media. </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Rather 
          than denying narrative Harryman distributes it. This redistribution of 
          narrative relates to the economies of redistribution that function at 
          the level of language but which propose a different teleology of desire 
          and gratification in language. The story is not there. It has more of 
          an abject status, not <i>not</i> there but there in a different form, 
          scattered rather than ordered to suggest a corporate recoverable whole. 
          According to Harryman, to deny narrative is in many ways the same as believing 
          in it: “Narrative is only a ping-pong ball among blindspots when considered 
          in the light of its advantages and defects”(1985, 104). To approach the 
          question of narrative and therefore the question of teleology in writing 
          as good or bad is therefore misguided. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like 
          narrative, ‘character’ in Harryman’s work is distributed across points, 
          points that include animate and inanimate objects. In Harryman’s most 
          recent play, <i>Performing Objects Stationed In Platform on the Sub (Urban) 
          World</i> the potential of the imagination and therefore, of the possibility 
          of fantasy and Utopia is recognised but not bracketed from the everyday. 
          The language of fairytales, of children in the “trail of breadcrumbs,” 
          is used in relation to the alienation and sense of estrangement that the 
          play examines in the contemporary city: “the village took their/breadcrumbs 
          for granted having forgotten where / they came from.” The live-subject 
          or performing object exists on a ground that is recognised both in terms 
          of the reality of the theatrical spectacle and of the world itself as 
          little more than a temporary platform on which to trade versions of these 
          realities, </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          piece of cloth (the tongue) is a product of the imagination in the same 
          way that the voices themselves are. The play seems to try to reach for 
          an accord between the performing objects and the objects such as the piece 
          of cloth, the feathers, gloves, the clothes pegs; each of them are objects 
          “stationed in platform,” not on platform but in platform, in plat form. 
          The OED defines “plat” as, among other things; a flat surface, a surface 
          or space generally, a plan or diagram of anything, an outline and the 
          collateral form of plot. The play then might in some sense be read as 
          a drawing of itself, with its own plot as a diagram of its performing 
          objects. The logic of which seems in a sense to be one of substitution 
          of the kind that might be made in a child’s game:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>C2b:</b> 
            She runs out of dolls before she<br>
            runs out of names, so uses large leaves<br>
            as substitutes for dolls: these leaves are<br>
            Kathy 1, Kathy 1/2, and Kathy 3.7. She<br>
            then resumes the “real” part of her job,<br>
            pinning blouses, dresses, shorts,<br>
            underwear, bras, and jeans to the line...  (3)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
          in this example the refracted performing objects carry out the actions 
          of their other ‘half’ on the stage. At this point C2a is pinning lengths 
          of coloured feather boas to the curtain. C2b provides a commentary on 
          the action. There is a sense that this action is a kind of sign for itself. 
          She doesn’t pin clothes to the curtain but the audience sees the bright 
          shapes of the feather boas against the black of the curtain that look 
          like a series of abstract clouds which themselves stand for the performing 
          objects on the stage; amorphous entities that shift with fluidity. The 
          challenge in Harryman’s plays as in her description of narrative is to 
          present bodies as she does narrative but redistributed. The performing 
          objects are always in excess or at an angle to that which could be considered 
          a bounded subject position and in this sense the live subject on the stage 
          multiplies itself, refracts and visually exceeds the sum total of named 
          parts. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Harryman’s 
          work seem to offer a space for the engagement of the process of a movement 
          between narrative points, points which if analysed in order to produce 
          a kind of teleology of event become blindspots. Instead the focus of the 
          reader or audience member of her plays needs to be mobile enough to offer 
          a consideration of the process of the teleology of the narrative rather 
          than it’s points of arrival and departure. This suggests a reader or live-subject 
          who is also in process as s/he engages with the work. Narrative, like 
          the reader is a mutable live subject that “mutates throughout history”(1985, 
          104). As Harryman suggests this is not something that can be stepped aside 
          from by the subject, even a denial of narrative is “part of the story”(1985, 
          104). The structure of narrative in Harryman’s work is reveals a degree 
          of ‘liveness’ in the sense that, like the situationists concept of detournment, 
          it is always on the point of being interrupted and diverted “en route 
          by a question”(1985, 104). This detournment, this interruption itself 
          becomes the ‘live’ subject of the narrative. As Harryman points out this 
          means that her work is both able to incorporate narrative and critique 
          it, by holding itself (the narrative) up as its own example. “Toy Boats,” 
          a theoretical critique on her writing practice, begins to enact this formulation 
          of narrative:</font></p>

          literally answering the question, “What is the Status of Narrative in 
          Your Work?” with a question Harryman redistributes the economy of question 
          and answer, of interlocutor and interlocutee. In doing so in this context 
          she blurs the boundaries between theory and practice, narrative becomes 
          an essential component of her theory just as theory is an essential component 
          and directing force in her so called ‘poetic’ practice. That Harryman’s 
          redistribution of narrative is directly related to her desire to redistribute 
          the economies of meaning in language, the labels of people and things, 
          can be clearly seen in the discussion of the zoo. “When you read the labels, 
          snakes occur someplace other than in their cages...” Narrative is like 
          an animal in the zoo, it can be confined and exhibited to a paying public 
          but ultimately this is an artificial state of affairs and the animal might 
          be better observed in its natural habitat, as it moves across other territories, 
          contexts and zones that are not containable. </font></p>

          similar point in relation to Gertrude Stein’s language which she describes 
          as “many animals.” She uses Deleuze and Guattari’s example of language 
          as an animal to show how necessary it is to oppose the cages of language

          describes the way in which the reading of Stein leads to a practice of 
          ‘wild’ reading which re-locates the ‘live’ subject. Spahr’s book is about 
          the necessity of extending literary criticism’s central question of what 
          kind of subjects literary works create to a consideration of the value 
          of works that generate connection between ‘live’ subjects through connection:</font></p>

            I mean forms of writing that take advantage of reading’s dynamic and 
            reciprocal nature. (5)</font></p>

          subjects find themselves, not kept separate from the world in cages, in 
          an apparently “natural recreation of habitat.” Spahr’s “changing notions 
          of the public, of everybody” describes the importance of a ‘live’ community 
          of readers that “respect[s] unlikeness”(5) and embraces alterity, who 
          resist assimilation into the dominant norms of culture and society through 
          their ability to remain ‘live’ by maintaining interaction and reciprocity 
          among themselves.  As Harryman  points out, “The question of the status
