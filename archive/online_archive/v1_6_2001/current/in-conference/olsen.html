      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        an increasingly technologised world varying degrees of liveness are already 
        in production. Our relationship to events is bound up with their representation 
        across a range of media including film, video and the internet. The work 
        of Leslie Scalapino, Fiona Templeton and Carla Harryman articulates a 
        complex investigation of the live subject in relation to the time of event 
        and to the time of writing itself. These relationships are acutely bound 
        up with an exploration of event as representation—representations which 
        paradoxically might occur simultaneously with their ‘live’ counterparts. 
        The term ‘degrees of liveness’ is not meant to imply that one degree is 
        more ‘live’ than another but that in each of the works considered the 
        temporal moment of the live cannot necessarily be fixed as occurring entirely 
        within the present moment. Through their work Scalapino, Templeton and 
        Harryman critique the idea of a monolithic live by unsettling the temporal 
        expectations of both the audience and subject.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        1992 L.A. riots and <i>The Disasters of War </i>(1811-12), a series of 
        etchings by Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) hover obliquely 
        over Leslie Scalapino’s play, <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> The play’s tangential 
        relation to these two sources raises questions concerning the construction 
        of the live subject in relation to events, specifically events that are 
        transmitted to the subject through live and electronic media. The play 
        looks at the way in which the ‘live’ subject might be constituted through 
        its relationship to the ‘technology’ of event. Both sources function as 
        a kind of lens through which to re-write/re-view the discourse of event, 
        the discourse of the live and electronically mediated subject. Scalapino 
        describes the play’s performance as “images occurring in a rhythm”(5). 
        “Images” in rhythm rather than words. This mimics the acute mediatisation 
        of images that accompanied the L.A. riots, and it also relates to the 
        hybrid nature of the play itself which includes directions for slide projections, 
        taped and live voices and characters ‘real’ and imaginary—many of the 
        visual techniques used by the media to ‘transmit’ the L.A. riots to those 
        inside and outside the city. The play calls for a paratactic form of reading 
        that posits meaning in the relationships between blocks of words and their 
        repetition. Scalapino describes these images as constituting narrative, 
        as “occurring in a rhythm of presentation as if ‘not planned’ as, but 
        are, elements of a linear plot...”(5). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        sequencing of images relates to Goya’s eighty five etchings, <i>The Disasters 
        of War</i> (1811-12). Each etching depicts a different view of the ongoing 
        guerrilla conflict between French troops and their Spanish opponents in 
        the wake of Napoleon’s occupation of Spain. <i>The Disasters</i> depict 
        a squalid and grotesque vision of humanity; rape, murder, mutilation of 
        corpses and the abandonment of children against a backdrop of the effects 
        of famine. Each plate bears a caption, and sometimes an observation about 
        what is taking place in the design; occasionally, Goya adds a moral or 
        an epigram: “with reason or without (rightly or wrongly); “the same;” 
        “and are like Wild Beasts;” “for this you were born;” “treat them and 
        then on again;” “bitter presence.” “I saw this,” reads the caption to 
        one of Goya’s etchings but what does this mean? Is it an inscribing of 
        the presence of the ‘live’ subject? And what exactly is this when considered 
        in relation to representations made <i>after</i> the event. Like Scalapino 
        he is writing from the ‘live’ standpoint of a subject who has experienced 
        some of the events, (hence “I saw this”) but many of the things that he 
        depicts have been transmitted to him, by word of mouth, by other sketchers, 
        just as the events of the L.A. riots have been mediated to Scalapino ‘live’ 
        via the television, via the newspapers. The live subject’s “I saw this” 
        is a tissue of varying degrees of liveness that have occurred over a period 
        of time. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fred 
        Licht compares <i>The Disasters</i> to twentieth century news photography 
        both in terms of content and in terms of material processes: “both are 
        almost infinitely reproducible, both reproduce imagery to black and white, 
        both are created by physical change wrought on the surface of a plate, 
        and both are meant to be broadcast very widely and at small expense”(134). 
        This is also true of writing itself, infinitely reproducible, in black 
        and white, made by physical changes to a surface, broadcast widely and 
        at small expense. This connection between etching, photography and writing 
        implies a direct relationship to the ‘live’ event and the performative 
        role of the subject or subjects in that event. It foregrounds a possibility 
        for writing in relation to performance that seems to stand in opposition 
        to Peggy Phelan’s definition of live performance as that which is not 
        reproducible. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Scalapino’s 
        writing presents ‘liveness’ as it is experienced by the subject in an 
        acutely mediatised society which is always ‘live’ but also infinitely 
        reproducible. This is not to confuse the idea of a series of gradations 
        of liveness with a discussion of the witnessing an event ‘at first hand,’ 
        gradations of liveness emerge at precisely the moment that the possibility 
        of representation comes into play which might be before, after or during 
        the event itself. Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> seems to explore positionings 
        of the writer/artist in relation to events mediated through electronic 
        communication systems and surveillance. Scalapino’s work, like Goya’s 
        <i>Disaster</i> series does not add up to one ‘version’ or perspective 
        of events and this is linked to the fact that both Scalapino and Goya 
        articulate ‘liveness’ in reproducible media. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gradations 
        or degrees of liveness are intimated on a number of levels within Scalapino’s 
        text: slides, voice-overs and video mediate the time of the subject. One 
        of the recurring images projected during the play is that of greyhounds 
        running, “in a blur of motion as if turning on each other in air”: </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        her introduction Scalapino relates these images to the unfolding of the

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
        gradations of liveness problematise an easy definition of the time of 
        event. Like the stills of the projected photographs, the voice-overs overlay 
        the live performance with another present, a live recorded speaking voice 
        that is re-played as a frozen moment of previous action. This mirrors 
        the construction of the play itself which is an overlapping of differing 
        moments. The voice-over also ‘reads’ projected slides of texts (but of 
        course she can’t read it at the same time as we, the audience see it). 
        There is a gap between her reading and our reading of the events, yet 
        the play assimilates them at the same time as drawing our attention to 
        it through the incorporation of a recorded ‘live’ voice. The overlapping 
        of live action with a previously recorded image or sound is also reversed 
        as projected images are themselves overlaid with other projected images: 
        “Another slide of rotting coyote landscape collaged with lotuses”(18). 
        The images of past actions are already themselves collaged and overlaid 
        with others which mimics the ebb and flow between memory, fantasy and 
        history. It also focuses on the power of the recording medium; writing, 
        memory, photography to themselves fabricate: “Memory’s being involuntary 
        and repeats things that do not occur—we have to do that—so that its motions 
        are the same as there. (She exits)”(33). The projections are also used 
        to refer to the intended site of the text as a serial in the newspaper: 
        “Slide of greyhound. Then slide in Japanese of the following passage, 
        as if vertical panels of newspaper columns.” Again there is a folding 
        of the outside in—the intended site of the writing becomes a space within 
        the live performance itself rather than being the container, the outside 
        frame, the outer boundary of the work, it is a cell within it. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        “Of the Refrain” Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari describe the way in 
        which sound and rhythm mark boundaries of territorial space and designate 
        order within that space as well as create nodes and networks beyond it. 
        The rhythm of images in <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> also mimics the space of the 
        city, a repetition of enclaves, discrete units for living in, barricading 
        oneself in, breaking out of, returning to. This territorial space is a 
        milieu, a milieu that is never static but which is “vibratory,” a piece 
        of space-time that resonates with its own refrain, its own periodic repetition 
        of itself as a subject.(313) The vibratory quality of the space-time block 
        is not limited to sound, “we call a refrain any aggregate of matters of 
        expression that draws a territory and develops into territorial motifs 
        and landscapes (there are optical, gestural, motor, etc., refrains).(323) 
        Rhythm equals plot, plot equals rhythm but these are not separate from 
        the subject itself; rhythm equals plot equals subject. A block of space-time 
        like the subject is coded to repeat its refrain and it is the variations 
        of this periodic repetition that constitutes itself and what is apart 
        from it. “Transcoding or transduction” is how Deleuze and Guattari refer 
        to the way in which the block of space-time that has been constituted 
        by the refrain can be built into or leads directly to another, that is 
        either dissipated or constituted in the exchange.(313) It is like a map 
        of a space, a plot which does not unfold in one direction from ‘a - b’ 
        but folds and unfolds, only to fold again and continue, plotting itself 
        unfolding: “<b>Dead Souls: </b>Every paragraph—sometimes a line is a paragraph—is 
        by itself. As if the segments are an expanse, or settings of separate 
        compartments. Which don’t blur into each other”(63). Like hypertextual 
        links or the rhythms of the refrain Scalapino’s subjects are self-generating 
        and produce others in periodic dissipation and exchange.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Goya’s 
        <i>Disasters</i> likewise represent a change in the usual relations of 
        space and time and therefore to the figuring of the live subject. There 
        is no fixed centre in Goya’s vision, “we cannot take our bearings in the 
        directionless world he shows us”(Licht, 141) and we are made emphatically 
        aware of the fragmentary nature of our perception, the fractional moment 
        of the “I saw this.” Similarly the cropping of the images means that “in 
        opposition to the Renaissance tradition, we are made aware of spaces that 
        are larger and possibly more important than the space we have actually 
        before us.” Our eyes are impelled beyond the frame of representation. 
        There is no containable ‘live’ moment. This can be compared to the excess 
        of viewpoints and overspill of event that is found in Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s

        included and escaping the frame; a frame itself which could “be an ad.” 
        An ad presents an already mediated event, at least one step from its ‘live’ 
        occurrence.  The time of the live-event is problematised by the fact that 
        the record may actually precede the event:</font></p>

        of fantasy, in which to ‘perform’ an event. She seems to be implying that 
        the transmission of the event and its occurrence are one and the same 
        thing. Ads, like riots do not occupy foreclosed spaces but spill out over 
        into that which is already spilling out of itself in various directions.

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Leslie 
        Savan makes a similar point in her analysis of the L.A. “Buy it riots”: 
        “Crisis calls for commercials...Ad age expanded the mission, running front-page 
        editorial—“A call to admen: Help stop riots.” It implored companies (like 
        sneaker firms) to make anti-violence ads...”(Savan:128), and in effect 
        to become central points of focus around which to re-organise order. Scalapino 
        refuses such totalizing measures, no controlling perspective ties the 
        elements together. There is no compositional climax that tells us that 
        the events described and enacted have importance in terms of a decipherable

        <i>Disaster </i>series, like Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> challenges 
        the compositional schemes of four centuries of Renaissance-Baroque tradition 
        in which a distinction is made between the central and the peripheral.  
        As Licht points out, “The most casual view of Dutch landscape or the most 
        neutral still life is still so articulated that there is a distinct center 
        at which the expressive potential of the composition is most compact. 
        Other areas of the painting, though they may be painted with equal care, 
        are ancillary”(144). Goya rejects this centrality of focus by suppressing 
        backgrounds/landscapes that are extraneous to the composition and this 
        has the effect of potentialising the whole field of the composition, “every 
        form within this field, whether it be a void or a volume, plays a part 
        that becomes progressively more equal in value to every other form within 
        the same field”(145). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        equality of forms within a field is a characteristic of Scalapino’s play. 
        There is no one perspective position or point of view which is privileged, 
        even the voices of the characters seem soluble into the elements of that 
        they seem to be witnessing and describing: “Presentation is the visual 
        events spoken, such as the sumo floating on the ocean horizon, being real 
        scrutiny of the vertical and horizontal line, of our vision as per the 
        set itself”(5). In this way, <i>Goya’s L.A.</i> presents layers of merging 
        and re-emerging planes of fantasy and reality that transcode and transduce 
        into series of multiple perspectives and subject positions that extend 
        not only laterally, but also vertically as the subject embeds itself at 
        different depth points. This merging posits a spatial configuration of 
        time which is similar to that which Deleuze finds in his description of 
        the time-image with its “coexistence of distant durations, or of levels 
        of duration; a single event can belong to several levels: the sheets of 
        the past coexist in a non-chronological order”(1988, xii). One of the 
        effects of this spatialisation is the difficulty of getting outside the 
        work in order to find a stable point from which to comment on it. Instead 
        the reader is returned inwards, folded back in.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Visually, 
        one sees in apparently inner captions. We don’t know what writing is,”(7) 
        claims Scalapino in her introduction to the work. The use of the image 
        of the caption again links her to Goya but in Scalapino’s work the caption 
        is inside. The verbal as merged with the visual, it is no longer separate. 
        Susan Sontag’s description of the caption in photography calls it “the 
        missing voice,” adding, “it is expected to speak for truth. But even an 
        entirely accurate caption is only one interpretation, necessarily a limiting 
        one, of the photograph to which it is attached. And the caption-glove 
        slips on so easily”(108). Scalapino allows no such reassuring gap between 
        caption and image, to see visually in inner captions implies an absorption 
        of writing into seeing: “I saw this,” becomes the opening up of the question, 
        ‘how’ this seeing was done? By posing this question Scalapino is critiquing 
        the way in which it is not only the world and its events which are mediated 
        for us through language, technology and economics but also our responses 
        to them, as if they had already occurred. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        relationship of the ‘live’ subject to its physical geography of place 
        and site is becoming increasingly redefined through technology. In their 
        recent book, <i>Information Techtonics</i>, Mark Wilson and Kenneth Corey 
        assert “The ability of land and place to define our identity is also changing 
        with the replacement of the physical by the electronic”(1). The language 
        of Fiona Templeton’s <i>You - The City </i>seems to assimilate this change. 
        The film of <i>You - The City</i> is a record of her theatre project in 
        New York in 1988. In the theatre piece that Templeton wrote and directed, 
        actors were positioned in different locations around the city of New York 
        and the audience made an appointment for a particular time in the day 
        when he or she would arrive at a small office and be led away with one 
        of the actors, the audience member would follow the actor to the next 
        rendezvous point where they would meet the next speaker/actor who would 
        talk to them before taking them to the next point and so on. These rendezvous 
        were quite literally that, a rounding on you in a poetic monologue that 
        directs the ‘client’ through the streets of the city. The first line of 
        the entire film is, “If I could tell you that you are alive.” And subsequently 
        each line in the film up until the significant changeover scene contains 
        the word “you,” dramatising an exchange of “you for you.” The way in which 
        the film is recorded replaces the ‘live’ ‘you’ with the camera, thus opening 
        a space for the audience to take the place of the live subject, as if 
        <i>they</i> were there, live. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
        work can be linked to that of the work of the situationists, who during 
        the 1960’s advocated the production or construction of situations that 
        would break down the boundary between theatrical and non-theatrical space, 
        and integrate players and audience (Sadler: 105):</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
        work involves the creation of a network of communication that takes place 
        alongside those that already exist in the city. At the same time Templeton 
        accentuates the artifice of the constructed situation through the character’s 
        use of highly stylised/poetic language. <i>You  - The City</i> can be 
        read in terms of what the situationists would have called a detournment 
        of the usual networks of communication and exchange. Whereas the Situationists 
        had plans to replace the stairways in Piranesi’s etchings with lifts and 
        recast the street dustbins in ivory, Templeton presents a detournment 
        of encounter. In translation, detournment carries with it more than a 
        sense of turning aside from or of a diversion, it also includes the sense 
        of re-routing or hijacking, embezzlement, misappropriation, corruption 
        (Sadler 17). In Templeton’s film of <i>You - The City</i>, the audience 
        member loses control not only of where they will go but who they are;  
        “I didn’t say your name to tell you it but because it is not mine.” The 
        detournment of the routes through the city is paralleled by the detournements 
        of language itself.  The spectator/audience member actively participates 
        to create an urban dynamic that is outside the drives of capital and bureaucracy. 
        This itself is a risky position for the live-subject, “a trap would feel 
        safer” intones one of the speakers. The camera as a point of focus is 
        itself vulnerable to the environment of the city, the camera crew is ambushed 
        by lolly-sucking children trying to get in on the frame of the shots, 
        shouting “Was I on television...?” The uncertainty of the camera as participant 
        is captured in the jerky angles and foregrounding of itself as a handheld 
        device that points to a space of an absent human presence that we as spectators 
        are encouraged to inhabit, it leaves a space for the new ‘I’ of the film 
        watcher to assume the space of the previous live-subject. There is also 
        a connection between route making and the construction of identity, for 
        both might lead to dead ends: “you must invent the truth,” in the face 
        of possibilities that are “red herrings.” The question of who is in control, 
        addresser or addressee is continually articulated just as who or what 
        the ‘I’ of addresser and addressee is, is continually re-adjusted. This 
        ‘I’ is repositioned through the discourse of the speakers who range from 
        seducers of the live-subject (“what shall I be for you”), to positers 
        of a jilted I, (“you want, you want the impossible”), a collusive ‘I’ 
        (“You’re my right hand in this”), a lost ‘I’ (“following gives you away”), 
        an ‘I’ that is filled with longing and fear (“who are you to be you, do 
        you have it in you?”), and a guilty transgressing ‘I’ (“after what has 
        passed between us you and I will not expect to see me again”).  None of 
        these ‘I’s are any more <i>authentic </i>than the other, no single one 
        is the <i>true</i> ‘live’ I. Instead Templeton’s text presents a split 
        and refracted live subject that appears to be filtered through endless 
        representations of itself. These constant refigurations of the ‘I,’ as 
        it overlaps, dissolves and is successively reconstituted, parallel the 
        use of projections and taped voices in Scalapino’s <i>Goya’s LA.</i> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
        text, like the situationists’ maps, works by describing an urban navigational 
        system that operates independently from the dominant patterns of circulation. 
        She draws attention to the routes of economic exchange, (“who gave you 
        to who?”) that dominate our networks of communication and identity through 
        the drama of the relationship of the pronouns to the city, (“you’re not 
        myself and that leaves you no one to say yes to”). This is the politics 
        of what the situationists called “drift”—i.e. a re rerouting of the subject 
        according to the chance and pleasure of encounter. Templeton’s work can 
        be read as a kind of situationist re-inscribing of the names of streets. 
        The city itself is also a live-subject, a body that is itself being re-inscribed 
        through the setting up of alternative networks of communication. These 
        alternative networks refigure the habitual journey from A to B by making 
        the journey, rather than the final destination, the focal point of the 
        text. Implicated in all these networks is a live-subject (the ‘you’ of 
        the audience) that is actively de-familiarised from itself: “wouldn’t 
        you like to know what it is like to see through someone else’s eyes?,” 
        “I wanna be you to you and I want you to be you,” before being urged to 
        take responsibility for this ‘you,’ this “shadow that is attached to the 
        body.” </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although 
        the version of the play ultimately comes to an end it is far from being 
        a closed text—the live-subject is “released” back into the city, the same 
        space that moments before had been channelled into a different use. Language, 
        like the city is re-routed and through becoming involved in the process 
        of the film as participants, we as ‘live’ audience are also re-routed 
        and refigured. Near the end of the film the ‘live-subject’ is asked to 
        make a telephone call, “say, I to you” the performer tells the client 
        and this call is put through to another ‘live-subject’ about to embark 
        on the performance. The live-subject of the audience communicates directly 
        to a past self, another participant at a different stage on the route. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Templeton’s 
        mediation both of the time of the event via the telephone and the virtual 
        filmic space of the ‘live-subject’ through electronic technology parallels 
        Stephen Graham’s formulation of, “Actor-Network Theories.” ANT emphasise 
        how particular social institutions and human actors “enroll” pieces of 
        technology, machines, as well as documents, texts, and money, into “actor-networks”(23). 
        There is a direct relationship between Templeton’s figuration of her project 
        as a film that moves through, across and into the city to redefine the 
        identity of the live subject and contemporary metaphors of the city used 
        to conceptualise a virtual geography of cyberspace.  In cyberspace an 
        Internet “point-of-presence” becomes a web site, on an information superhighway, 
        the satellite node becomes the teleport, the Bulletin Board system becomes 
        a virtual community or electronic neighbourhood. Web sites run by municipalities 
        become virtual cities located near electronic frontiers that are traversed 
        by web surfers, virtual travellers and electronic flaneurs.(9) Cyber-space 
        is in a way like a fragmented city; “‘Cyberspace,’” argues Graham, “therefore 
        needs to be considered as a fragmented, divided, and contested multiplicity 
        of heterogeneous infrastructures and actor-networks”(24). These are also 
        the qualities that Fiona Templeton highlights through her portrayal of 
        the city in relation to the live subject, who proceeds from fragmented 
        voice to voice, each of which contest the definition of ‘I’, ‘you,’ and 
        the city.</font></p>

        statement by Templeton implies a relationship between the writer and the 
        reader or audience that is fraught with tension. Narrative figures as 
        the principle actant in the struggle here. The audience/reader wants a 
        story, they want blood but Templeton won’t give it to them until they 
        have given. She demands of them even as they demand of her, literally 
        baying for blood. For audience and reader there is “something dangerous 
        that looks like a story.(1985, 80) In the book version of <i>YOU - The 
        City,</i> Templeton tries to create a similar space for the reader as 
        she did for the ‘live’ you of the theatre version by transcribing the 
        conversations of the actors and the clients that took place during or 
        after the performance into a column of the text alongside the script, 
        which she refers to as the “unintendable.” The documentation of the event 
        becomes one in which the script of the original <i>YTC</i> is not extracted 
        from its moment of performance but accrues it as another voice, so the 
        text itself becomes its own narrative with implicit degrees or levels 
        of ‘liveness.’ This represents a juxtaposition of chance encounter and 
        pre-scripted event that was an essential component of the original piece:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So the

          intentions; or subjectively, for whoever was you; or whether you wanted 
          to speak as well as hear. Reception is also intention: what I meant 
          depended on what you thought I meant, and this was what I meant. If 
          I mean, I mean you. (vii)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here 
        Templeton compares the chance encounter of the play with the relationship 
        between the reader coming by chance upon a text, while surrounded by an 
        ongoing reality, very much as the clients and actors were in the performance 
        version of the text. She effectively invites the reader to participate, 
        “what I meant depended on what you thought I meant.” Meaning is the production 
        of the chance encounter between a scripted you and the ‘live’ subject 
        as reader, his/her previous selves already embedded as a layer of narrative 
        within the text. Templeton’s attitude to the text is one which keeps in 
        play the ‘live’ and provisional nature of the script as a direct address 
        to the ‘live’ subject who has metamorphosed into the reader: “The structure 
        allows the piece to be vertically apprehended and should perhaps be seen 
        as not rules but solutions, and questions I have of you”(viii). The notes 
        to the performer/reader also indicate a space for improvisation and so 
        allow for another degree of ‘liveness’ within the text. Each performer 
        is given a different strategy for improvisation if “it becomes necessary,” 
        i.e. if they are interrupted. Templeton’s only proviso is that “all improvised 
        lines must use the word ‘you’”(IYT, viii). By leaving her performers this 
        space for improvisation Templeton introduces a radical degree of liveness 
        into the text which allows for the interaction between client and performer. 
        This is quite different from the degree of liveness experienced in the 
        conventional theatrical space in which a stable text is delivered to a 
        passive audience. Ironically the effect of this is that the ‘you’ of the 
        live subject becomes the one constant of the performance at the same time 
        as it is the structure that is most radically challenged. What remains 
        constant is not the audience's passivity but their ability to influence 
        the course of the production, so the are kept in a state of perpetual 
        ‘liveness’ rather than being subsumed into a fourth wall.</font></p>

        points of departure in relation to the participants of <i>You -  the City

        from differing contexts. Rauschenberg uses materials such as paint and 
        canvas and found or every day materials such as wood, doors, household 
        rubbish, as well as more exotic junk, like the crow in “Canyon.” “Minutiae” 
        was actually made for use in performances of a ballet by Merce Cunningham 
        with music by John Cage and “The Tower” was created as part of the set 
        for the Paul Taylor Dance Company. The catalogue essay to an exhibition 
        of Rauschenberg’s work at the Tate in 1981 makes a parallel between the

          of dissociation but internally. The structural, incorporated and painted 
          elements seem to function independently of each other but simultaneously. 
          The constructions that were made for the dance theatre were characteristically 
          neither back-drops nor, quite, props. They approximate to the human 
          scale and were free-standing and self-contained, occupying the same 
          space as the dancers. When used on the stage they took on the role of 
          additional dancers. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        relates on a number of levels to Templeton’s project. <i>You - the City</i> 
        exists in relation to the world around it without trying to illustrate 
        it. Just as the elements that incorporated into the “combines” have been 
        part of everyday life before they were incorporated into the work to be 
        viewed, so the baseball court and the streets themselves are already part 
        of the everyday life of the viewer. The difference is that Rauschenberg 
        ultimately relies on the resonance of this former context to be carried 
        with the work once it is removed from the world and posited in a gallery. 
        Thus the simultaneity of elements described in the catalogue, “incorporated 
        and painted elements [that] seem to function independently of each other 
        but simultaneously” is quite different from the simultaneity of contexts 
        which Templeton’s project allows as the piece is not bracketed from the 
        world by use of a conventional theatrical space. This disassociation “internally” 
        that the writer notes in Rauschenberg’s work isn’t possible to locate 
        in Templeton because of the lack of ‘frame.’ At the same time it is there 
        because of the effect of the piece on its participants, “I remember standing 
        in that / kid’s playground, and / thinking, what a set. Like if / you 
        look at a painting by / Rauschenberg or Johns and / you have painted parts 
        and / then you have a real broom / stuck in, and you think, / what is 
        that doing there?”(54).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        might or might not be a direct reference to Rauschenberg’s “Tower” which 
        combines a broom, an umbrella, a light and a table in a painted structure. 
        These elements, like the clients and the performers in <i>You - The City</i>, 
        are a mix of “structural, incorporated and painted elements [that] seem 
        to function independently of each other but simultaneously.” In this sense 
        the performers and the clients become the elements of the combine and 
        the Changeover scene allows them to temporarily suspend their apparently 
        designated role as “incorporated or painted element.” Just as the best 
        of Rauschenberg’s combines start to open the question: which bits are 
        made and which found? Was it painted like that when he found it or did 
        he paint it? In the same way so the designated roles of the ‘live-subject’ 
        in <i>You - the City</i> blur. This figuration of the client as the readymade 
        element of a combine is emphasised by the fact that at the moment the 
        client leaves his/her performer and walks toward the two people, the performer 
        from that couple leaves his client: “Meanwhile, one of those two (in fact 
        Performer J, although the client will not be aware of this fact) leaves 
        the other and walks towards Performer H and her client.” The performer 
        and the client cross at the centre of the courts and the client moves 
        forward to join the other client:</font></p>

        Templeton points out, “The success of this changeover scene rests on the 
        assumption that, judging from previous base scenes the client will take 
        the person he or she is approaching to be the performer of the next scene”(54). 
        Thus, the success of the scene is based on the misrecognition of the self 
        as other. The ‘I’ which is mistaken for ‘you.’ The readymade is itself 
        duped into thinking it is making its way toward its other when in fact 
        it is making its way toward a future version of itself. In the text of 
        the play the subsequent scene, Act II Scene iii - With Other, is itself 
        a blank, “The details of this scene are of course unknown”(56), an unknown 
        quantity of event and chance encounter between two live subjects that 
        cannot be scripted. Instead the people that had been performers watch 
        it and for a moment the relationship between client and performer is reversed.

          this snapshot effect, like a speech delivered on no matter what occasion

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        idea of the readymade as encounter relates to Templeton’s <i>You - the 
        City</i> in a number of ways. The play does not rely on the foreclosed 
        and pre-designated space of the theatre for its existence and is therefore 
        more open to chance and encounter as action. Like Duchamp, Templeton designates 
        the piece by planning to “inscribe a readymade” at a specific moment in 
        time at various points of this unbounded terrain. Just as the contexts 
        of Duchamp’s readymades are not limited to their art context so too Templeton’s 
        encounters are not confined to the theatre. The play is a series of simultaneous 
        speeches that cannot be heard at once by any one spectator/viewer/client 
        but each one represents “a kind of rendezvous” between the client and 
        the performer that also emphasises the “serial characteristic of the readymade.” 
        The appointment that the client is given to turn up at a particular time 
        at No. 1 Times Square marks the moment that the readymade of the piece 
        is inscribed and so comes into being.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        his book, <i>Kant After Duchamp</i>, Thierry de Duve extracts three essential 
        conditions for the readymade: the first of these is to specify the readymade, 
        the second is to inscribe the readymade and the third is to sign it. The 
        question of signing the readymade becomes an interesting problem in relation 
        to the play. The book is certainly signed, the words inside are attributed 
        to Fiona Templeton and therefore the words of the script and interestingly 
        the background noise and fallout of the conversations around the play 
        are also attributed to her. By designating the time and space of the readymade 
        she in a sense chooses to author this designated duration of space/time. 
        As I have suggested the work becomes more like one of Rauschenberg’s combines—elements 
        of found objects meeting in chance encounters with a scripted (painted 
        element). Just as Duchamp’s signature does not designate control over 
        the production of the objects (that they are often factory produced is 
        masked by their newly designated context), so Templeton’s appropriation 
        does not imply an authorship or control over all the words. This is interesting 
        to consider in the role of the artist as figured by Duchamp as a chooser 
        of what to designate as art rather than a maker: “once the idea of fabrication 
        has dropped off, the act of naming the object becomes a relevant condition 
        for specifying its encounter with an author who chooses it as much as 
        he is chosen by it...”(397). Interestingly the weight of this choice in 
        <i>You - the City</i> is shifted from the author (Templeton) to the client. 
        As “knowing broom” they designate themselves as readymades by choosing 
        to take part in the structure of the play. The “knowing broom” chooses 
        to designate itself as a readymade rather than waiting to be chosen by 
        the author/artist. </font></p>

        the integral importance of these ‘live’ blind-spots within the play in 
        which participants and the scenes and objects around them oscillate across 
        a number of contexts and meaning itself becomes unstable. The decision 
        to include these parts foregrounds the way in which both the written text 
        and the performed text rely on a process of accrual for the generation 
        of meaning. The interjections that accompany the written text are taken 
        from performances of the play in both New York and London as if to suggest 
        that the text will accrue more and more of these blind-spots as it moves 
        from site to site. In the performance the participant learns through participating 
        in the piece what to expect at certain points. At its most successful

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        relationship between metaphor and the live and electronic subject’s relationship 
        to language is a central question in Carla Harryman’s collaboration with 
        the artist Amy Trachtenberg. Their text, “The Games” (http://www.markszine.com), 
        addresses the objectness of words. It is a game of whether words are things 
        and by extension, at what point the metaphor becomes the thing itself 
        both literally and figuratively. The ‘live subject’ must negotiate both 
        visual and verbal readings of text in order to proceed. In a sense, Harryman’s 
        project rejects this distinction between word and thing, and between language 
        and image while at the same time investigating its boundaries. In a similar 
        way she rejects the representation of a bounded subject embedded within 
        a wider objective framework of time-space. This hypertext project is also, 
        as the title suggests, a game with the aim, “to prevent, and if unable 
        to prevent, destroy triangulations, triads, triangles, trinities, threesomes, 
        the third party, the party line, closure.” It involves both visual and 
        verbal elements and extends Harryman’s interest in the possibilities of 
        the performativity of language on the page. As Harryman explains, “I use 
        the page to perform the dialogue, first, although I think of the page 
        also as a staging device.” This staging device further extends its possibilities 
        through the use of the interactive computer screen. The ‘live-subject’ 
        activates ‘live’ elements on the screen via clicking on the icons of “dice” 
        or an “ear” or a “seed pod” and this leads her/him to small blocks of 
        writing. The reading live subject participates directly in choosing the 
        pathway through the text while aware of other choices s/he could have 
        taken. There is a choice of whether to continue in a linear way, i.e. 
        to keep returning to the same icon (“dice,” “ear,” “pod”) or whether to 
        move between games (to go from “ear” to “dice” to “pod.”) This process 
        encourages the reader to become self-consciously aware of her relationship 
        to the reading of the text itself. It creates a space for a reader whose 
        degree of liveness is figured by a recognition of the radical possibility 
        of the subjunctive: <i>what if I were to click here...what if I might....would 
        it make a difference if I...</i></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        a way these observations on the work could be generalised to include most 
        projects carried out in a hypertext format. What interests me is the way 
        in which the writing itself raises questions about how it situates the 
        live and electronic ‘I’ at the level of actual as opposed to virtual language 
        use. Harryman’s text is an investigation of the relationship between performativity 
        and dialogue that occurs across discourses.  As she said in her 1996 interview 
        with Megan Simpson, “I like to put families of language in conversation 
        with each other, such as theoretical discourse, fiction, and nonsense.”

          unfold  in godly fashion. The weight of empires, the industrial revolution, 
          class struggle spread out from the images observed by the selves holding

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        game and players become analogous to the live-subject that imagines he/she 
        is the “centre of the universe.” The very structure of the hyper-text 
        work calls this idea of the possibility of the unitary ‘live’ subject 
        into question. Layers of games begin to emerge, games within games that 
        are themselves representations of other games. And what is a game? A network 
        of players, a structure governing rules of behaviour, a hypertextual system 
        that is itself one node within the networks of the global communication 
        and exchange. Harryman raises the question of whether/if/should the ‘live-subject’ 
        play along with the route that has been laid out for them or skip  in 
        electronic jouissance—outside to other sites, or on to other games, networks, 
        structures of information. But this is not an easy option: “When a player 
        gets that card, the player usually folds for fear of betraying secret 
        partnerships outside the gaming room. If the player doesn’t fold, the 
        others around the table begin to sweat.” The author is herself inside 
        the web, she too is a live-subject struggling with and within the systems 
        of language and representation, “I can’t tell you how many times I have 
        tried myself; for instance, if you open the back door to irrationality, 
        the door can’t shut i.e. if the door shuts the you/one (the player, performer, 
        or agent) is/are again defeated.” It is this threshold between the semiotic 
        and the symbolic utterance that the subject negotiates with risk, and 
        in a sense this potential risk is the narrative of the live-subject in 
        action. As <i>The Game of Memorializing </i>makes clear, “The most feared 
        card is an image of abstract entanglements after the asphalt jungle has 
        peeled away.” Between words and things, between abstraction and the concrete, 
        the hypertext web of <i>The Games</i> invents a space for a live-subject 
        who is not a self.  This is not necessarily a negative dilemma, as suggested 
        in <i>The Game of Memorializing</i>, “There is no self. No ball supported 
        by gleaming muscles, no heroic dragging of singularity. But others connected 
        to her.” </font></p>

        discussing her plays, <i>The Third Man</i> and <i>La Quotidienne,</i> 
        Harryman illuminates this use of dialogic relationships between speakers 
        that contain selves within selves that are themselves caught in another 
        network of giving and receiving by saying: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’m interested

          itself is only heard as a question she would ask herself, something 
          that would be a product of her own mind. Thus you ask me, “Do you like 
          roses?” And I answer with the question “Have you disposed of the fading 
          roses?” because I had been thinking about tossing the wilting cut flowers 
          out. Your question might be, “Do you like roses?” And my answer might 
          be, “I’ve been thinking about it off and on all morning.” It might in

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        a sense this type of language use in writing—to not necessarily know that 
        the answer may (note the use of the subjunctive again) end up differing 
        from the question—is the relationship between the theory and practice 
        of writing and reading the live and/or electronic subject; theoretically 
        there is the possibility to proceed in a  linear fashion, sticking to 
        the path offered by the successive texts in a <i>The Game of Moisture</i> 
        or in <i>The Game of Memorializing</i> but there is also the possibility 
        of veering off in other directions, to cross-reference to other games 
        within that game, to exit and remove oneself to another site-of-presence, 
        another place on the geographical map. What I want to stress is that although 
        these are formal options of hypertext they are not exclusively their domains. 
        Harryman in all her writings examines and inhabits a mode of hybridity 
        (as she says, “crossing boundaries is important if one wants to get a 
        sense of how to live”(524)) and it is this sense of how to live that radically 
        questions what Megan Simpson calls the “authenticity of the subject” through 
        its constant redefinitions in flux across media. </font></p>

        to get from A to C by way of, at least, D. This is not only the story

        305)</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Rather 
        than denying narrative Harryman distributes it. This redistribution of 
        narrative relates to the economies of redistribution that function at 
        the level of language but which propose a different teleology of desire 
        and gratification in language. The story is not there. It has more of 
        an abject status, not <i>not</i> there but there in a different form, 
        scattered rather than ordered to suggest a corporate recoverable whole. 
        According to Harryman, to deny narrative is in many ways the same as believing 
        in it: “Narrative is only a ping-pong ball among blindspots when considered 
        in the light of its advantages and defects”(1985, 104). To approach the 
        question of narrative and therefore the question of teleology in writing 
        as good or bad is therefore misguided. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like 
        narrative, ‘character’ in Harryman’s work is distributed across points, 
        points that include animate and inanimate objects. In Harryman’s most 
        recent play, <i>Performing Objects Stationed In Platform on the Sub (Urban) 
        World</i> the potential of the imagination and therefore, of the possibility 
        of fantasy and Utopia is recognised but not bracketed from the everyday. 
        The language of fairytales, of children in the “trail of breadcrumbs,” 
        is used in relation to the alienation and sense of estrangement that the 
        play examines in the contemporary city: “the village took their/breadcrumbs 
        for granted having forgotten where / they came from.” The live-subject 
        or performing object exists on a ground that is recognised both in terms 
        of the reality of the theatrical spectacle and of the world itself as 
        little more than a temporary platform on which to trade versions of these 
        realities, </font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What serves

      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        piece of cloth (the tongue) is a product of the imagination in the same 
        way that the voices themselves are. The play seems to try to reach for 
        an accord between the performing objects and the objects such as the piece 
        of cloth, the feathers, gloves, the clothes pegs; each of them are objects 
        “stationed in platform,” not on platform but in platform, in plat form. 
        The OED defines “plat” as, among other things; a flat surface, a surface 
        or space generally, a plan or diagram of anything, an outline and the 
        collateral form of plot. The play then might in some sense be read as 
        a drawing of itself, with its own plot as a diagram of its performing 
        objects. The logic of which seems in a sense to be one of substitution 
        of the kind that might be made in a child’s game:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>C2b:</b> 
          She runs out of dolls before she<br>
          runs out of names, so uses large leaves<br>
          as substitutes for dolls: these leaves are<br>
          Kathy 1, Kathy 1/2, and Kathy 3.7. She<br>
          then resumes the “real” part of her job,<br>
          pinning blouses, dresses, shorts,<br>
          underwear, bras, and jeans to the line...  (3)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        in this example the refracted performing objects carry out the actions 
        of their other ‘half’ on the stage. At this point C2a is pinning lengths 
        of coloured feather boas to the curtain. C2b provides a commentary on 
        the action. There is a sense that this action is a kind of sign for itself. 
        She doesn’t pin clothes to the curtain but the audience sees the bright 
        shapes of the feather boas against the black of the curtain that look 
        like a series of abstract clouds which themselves stand for the performing 
        objects on the stage; amorphous entities that shift with fluidity. The 
        challenge in Harryman’s plays as in her description of narrative is to 
        present bodies as she does narrative but redistributed. The performing 
        objects are always in excess or at an angle to that which could be considered 
        a bounded subject position and in this sense the live subject on the stage 
        multiplies itself, refracts and visually exceeds the sum total of named 
        parts. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Harryman’s 
        work seem to offer a space for the engagement of the process of a movement 
        between narrative points, points which if analysed in order to produce 
        a kind of teleology of event become blindspots. Instead the focus of the 
        reader or audience member of her plays needs to be mobile enough to offer 
        a consideration of the process of the teleology of the narrative rather 
        than it’s points of arrival and departure. This suggests a reader or live-subject 
        who is also in process as s/he engages with the work. Narrative, like 
        the reader is a mutable live subject that “mutates throughout history”(1985, 
        104). As Harryman suggests this is not something that can be stepped aside 
        from by the subject, even a denial of narrative is “part of the story”(1985, 
        104). The structure of narrative in Harryman’s work is reveals a degree 
        of ‘liveness’ in the sense that, like the situationists concept of detournment, 
        it is always on the point of being interrupted and diverted “en route 
        by a question”(1985, 104). This detournment, this interruption itself 
        becomes the ‘live’ subject of the narrative. As Harryman points out this 
        means that her work is both able to incorporate narrative and critique 
        it, by holding itself (the narrative) up as its own example. “Toy Boats,” 
        a theoretical critique on her writing practice, begins to enact this formulation 
        of narrative:</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>What 
        Is the Status of Narrative in Your Work?</b></font></p>

            the boats are large, are they not?<br>
            Whatever gave you that idea?<br>

            You are introspective?<br>
            I am an indication of what occurs around me. For instance, some snakes 
            occur in forests; whereas, others occur at the zoo. This is something 
            zoos will not confess, for when you read the labels, snakes occur 
            someplace other than in their cages.<br>
            Your argument doesn’t follow. You are a false philosopher.

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
        literally answering the question, “What is the Status of Narrative in 
        Your Work?” with a question Harryman redistributes the economy of question 
        and answer, of interlocutor and interlocutee. In doing so in this context 
        she blurs the boundaries between theory and practice, narrative becomes 
        an essential component of her theory just as theory is an essential component 
        and directing force in her so called ‘poetic’ practice. That Harryman’s 
        redistribution of narrative is directly related to her desire to redistribute 
        the economies of meaning in language, the labels of people and things, 
        can be clearly seen in the discussion of the zoo. “When you read the labels, 
        snakes occur someplace other than in their cages...” Narrative is like 
        an animal in the zoo, it can be confined and exhibited to a paying public 
        but ultimately this is an artificial state of affairs and the animal might 
        be better observed in its natural habitat, as it moves across other territories, 
        contexts and zones that are not containable. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        her excellent book, <i>Everybody’s Autonomy</i>, Juliana Spahr makes a 
        similar point in relation to Gertrude Stein’s language which she describes 
        as “many animals.” She uses Deleuze and Guattari’s example of language 
        as an animal to show how necessary it is to oppose the cages of language 
        use that shore up the monolithic structures/strictures of society:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To make 
          use of the polylingualism of one’s own language, to make a minor or 
          intensive use of it, to oppose the oppressed quality of this language 
          to its oppressive quality, to find points of nonculture or underdevelopment, 
          linguistic Third World zones by which language can escape, an animal 
          enters into things, an assemblage comes into play (48).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Spahr 
        describes the way in which the reading of Stein leads to a practice of 
        ‘wild’ reading which re-locates the ‘live’ subject. Spahr’s book is about 
        the necessity of extending literary criticism’s central question of what 
        kind of subjects literary works create to a consideration of the value 
        of works that generate connection between ‘live’ subjects through connection:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By “connection” 
          here I mean works that present and engage with large, public worlds 
          that are in turn shared with readers. I mean forms of writing that well 
          represent and expand changing notions of the public, of everybody. And 
          I mean forms of writing that take advantage of reading’s dynamic and 
          reciprocal nature. (5)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        connection is important in relation to the figuring of the text in relation 
        to and not separate from the “large, public worlds” in which these live 
        subjects find themselves, not kept separate from the world in cages, in 
        an apparently “natural recreation of habitat.” Spahr’s “changing notions 
        of the public, of everybody” describes the importance of a ‘live’ community 
        of readers that “respect[s] unlikeness”(5) and embraces alterity, who 
        resist assimilation into the dominant norms of culture and society through 
        their ability to remain ‘live’ by maintaining interaction and reciprocity 
        among themselves.  As Harryman  points out, “The question of the status 
        of narrative presupposes a hierarchy of literary values I do not entertain 
        in my work”(1985, 106). </font></p>
