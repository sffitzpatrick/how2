            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writing 
              from an Australian context it is difficult to think about “women’s 
              experimental writing” as anything other than a luxurious indulgence––whether 
              local or global. But there are, of course, many experimental women 
              writers here. There is great value in “experimentation” in its disruption 
              of existing oppressions and its obvious undermining of power. Poetry’s 
              verticality and lineation guarantees its placement in the “experimental 
              writing” category. In my own work I have tended to code and abstract 
              out from the quotidian &amp; the colloquial and by floating or severely 
              shortening the lines, my aim is to achieve an opposition to restrictive 
              forms and “conservative” lyrical and linear poetry.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
              this country it has been too easy to forget, or to deny that the 
              land was stolen by whites and that “we” are responsible for the 
              actions of the earlier colonisers––even though many of “us” are 
              immigrants or have arrived recently. In this situation, in order 
              to reconcile past misdemeanours, it is absolutely necessary that 
              the local dominate at this point in time. But I can’t see how didacticism 
              could have any use or give any pleasure to a reader––so I react 
              against it. All I can do is assist indigenous writers in coming 
              to the attention of readers.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, 
              here, it’s a tricky time for experimentation. Australia is an extremely 
              diverse, multicultural society. Here, we call many people NESBs––people 
              from Non-English-Speaking Backgrounds. (This is probably an international 
              acronym). Generations of these people have influenced Australian 
              culture-at-large, especially since the second world war, Korean 
              war and Vietnamese war, the bombing of Lebanon, the Gulf war, Tiananmen 
              Square incidents in China, Bosnia-Herzogovinian war, the East-Timorese 
              struggle for independence and so on, as waves of refugees and immigrants, 
              including writers and other artists, have settled here.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">English 
              is my language. I have the usual Euro-centric smatterings of romance 
              languages and, once, I attempted to learn Vietnamese. I regret the 
              dominance of English over other languages.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’m 
              not “fascinated” by the untranslatability of poetry. I’m saddened 
              and frustrated by it. I’ve participated in translation workshops 
              at the “Festival franco-anglais de poésie” in Paris. Although the 
              experience was enriching, untranslatability was the conclusion. 
              There is so much writing that I have read ONLY in translation.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
              does seem to be a transnational “community” of women experimenters––but 
              I am only aware of this because of the internet and it does seem 
              to be mostly led by women from the United States. I don’t see this 
              as hindering women writers but then I write &amp; read in English.</font><br>

            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              aesthetic world of the Australian word artist thalia is a veritable 
              mine of poetic <i>and</i> political possibilities for visual expression.&nbsp; 
              The chief mode of thalia’s compositions is Pitman’s Shorthand, a 
              now antiquated system of secretarial notation widely used by stenographers 
              through the 1970s.&nbsp; By arranging such shorthand symbols on 
              the page, providing a key at the bottom of the page to decipher 
              for the reader the symbols' meanings, and giving the poem a title 
              that locates the subtext of its iconography, thalia produces poems 
              of extraordinary elaboration, subtlety, and conscience.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Karl 
              Young says that thalia’s method of writing “completely recast(s) 
              and reform(s) an existing writing system, without making it arcane 
              or inaccessible to many readers throughout the world”(<a href="http://www.concentric.net/%7Elndb/thalia/kthal00.htm" target="_blank">“thalia:&nbsp; 
              a survey”</a>).&nbsp;The prior system Young alludes to is of course 
              shorthand, insinuating that thalia reconstitutes the shorthand form 
              by removing it from its cultural circumstance and installing it 
              in the discourse of art, thus attributing an aesthetic function 
              to the writing rather than merely its original, practical denotation.&nbsp; 
              thalia transforms what once was a language of the female administrator 
              in the corporate world into a code of artistic declaration that 
              enfranchises the feminine artist, transforming the subordinate into 
              the subversive.&nbsp; As Young remarks: “On one level, thalia’s 
              subversion of this language suggests a revolt against authority 
              of all sorts; on another level, it suggests a revolt against the 
              arrogance of wealth and power; on perhaps yet another, it could 
              suggest just how much rebellion of secretaries [then and now] could 
              bring the industrial world to a screeching halt.”&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">thalia’s 
              appropriation of the underlings’ language to exercise a voice of 
              artistic agency has obvious political undertones of both class and 
              gender.&nbsp; However, the dimension of cultural critique in her 
              poetry extends beyond the impact of the medium.&nbsp; With poems 
              such as “Army,” “nuclear fears,” and “Desert Storm,” thalia composes 
              visual images that resonate within current counter-ideological thought 
              and explicitly draw attention to the contentious relationships of 
              the State.&nbsp; Yet the central notion of each poem is thoroughly 
              felt in the plainness of its language, hence thalia’s ability to 
              not “mak(e) it arcane or inaccessible to many readers throughout 
              the world.”&nbsp; Ironically, it is the abstractness (and therefore 
              minimalism and simplicity) of the visual designs that make them 
              accessible “to many readers throughout the world.”&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
              the artistic impulse to compose in the abstract visual form has 
              very esoteric roots; in the literary avant-gardes of Futurism, Dadaism, 
              and Concretism, elite circles of artists in select urban enclaves 
              dialogue with(in) the university and are protected by the Arts.&nbsp; 
              The established literary sense that enables visual poetics is far 
              removed from the ordinary mass appeal implied by Young's perception 
              of thalia’s creations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one enables the other, 
              as the meaning of thalia’s visual poems conforms to both theory 
              and simplicity.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
              this is the brilliance of thalia’s work.&nbsp; Within the context 
              of globalization and experimentation in women’s poetries, thalia’s 
              shorthand poems exemplify the nexus of possibilities available for 
              contemporary expression.&nbsp; The aesthetic of concrete poetry 
              visible in her work borrows from the Brazilian and German avant-garde 
              of the 1950s, while the shorthand comes from the corporate world 
              of the Anglophone woman pre-1980s, and the poems’ themes reflect 
              more recent political turmoil such as the Persian Gulf War and expanding 
              nuclear armament.&nbsp; The diversity of inspirational resources 
              refracted in thalia’s poetry exhibits an extraordinarily sophisticated 
              level of poetic process, one that weaves together the political 
              and the aesthetic in ways that minimize the matter of writing by 
              encoding it simultaneously with social critique and literary theory.&nbsp; 
              thalia’s shorthand poems demonstrate not only a present but a future 
              for the continuing globalization of subaltern poetries, one that 
              necessarily engages narrative and style, the histories of people 
              as well as of scripture.&nbsp; Both are vital to the global experiment, 
              and no one shows it more starkly than thalia.</font></p>

              from the vantage point of those who do not consider the Western, 
              Western (or the Eastern, Eastern), of those who do not regard the 
              Anglophone World as the next best emergence to that of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, 
              there, where poetry exists with no qualifier, is where I go and 
              therefore am––race, gender, class, religion, regardless––there, 
              a swarm, a transnational community, always marginal and post-colonial, 
              always coming through. The Anglophone World cannot draw the swarm 
              into complicity or eccentricity, rather, is itself transformed into 
              one of the many scapegoats to the ongoing proliferation of <i>Gesellschaft</i> 
              (society) vs. <i>Gemeinschaft</i> (community), of materialism/consumerism/capitalism, 
              sailing through the pearly gates of “democratization,” enhancing 
              desire while multiplying signs and aesthetic values, and poetry 
              (art) is waning. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Globalization 
              is yet another phenomenon the Anglophone (digital) World has created. 
              Therein lies discomfort due to proximity. But the poet is always 
              experiencing discomfort, regardless of proximity or distance (most 
              preferring distance, as it orders, provides neutrality, transformation). 
              Distance need not evaporate in the presence of globalization, however, 
              and it would not, if we were to withstand the demands of conformity 
              cast by the information age, by its sucking (perforation) through 
              the surveillance and management of desire, withering the senses, 
              ethics, our voice. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              mist of philosophy hovers around art. Still, the lag between cultural 
              practice and the theorization of that practice prevails, as does 
              the lag between poetry and literature. We are thankful for that. 
              Personal and cultural histories linger in the body memory of the 
              globalized and transnational poet. No need to be concerned with 
              the translatability or not of the poem. There is no <i>Gestalt</i>, 
              no <i>Bildung, </i>when it comes to poetry. Linguistic and cultural 
              specificity can be experienced (if at all necessary) in ways other 
              than translation. The poem is beyond labels (the work was never 
              conceived, let alone created by a poet). Poetry comes from feeling—a 
              universal experience—such that literary theory and thought need 
              not create clones as they transverse the organs of the poet, the 
              organs that vary according to his or her sensibilities. There is 
              always simulation. Simulation suggests, therefore, may be considered 
              good enough. The theme song from the film <i>Love Story</i> simulates 
              Oum Kulthoum’s <i>Anta ’Omri</i>; more so with different periods, 
              as in Peter Maxwell Davis’ <i>Black Pentecost</i> simulating Kurt 
              Weil’s <i>Petroleum Song</i>. Leopardi to Nazim Hikmet to Siamando 
              to Laura Riding––transposition, semblance. We fall apart as we come 
              together; we come together as we fall apart. There is a deterritorialization 
              only poetry (art) can reach, matter passing into sensation, faceless, 
              genderless, voiceless, awaiting the future as a new version of itself––a 
              pattern, not the thread.</font></p>

              i would be belanguing to? How would i join? And where? What are 
              the dues? Especially, this is disturbing when i think that membership 
              from même (self-same) is predicated on some fantasy of autonomous 
              identity. Premised on patriarchal relations of the reproduction 
              of sameness. And, as i can not re-member where i was, who i wanted 
              to be; and, as i shift with every letter, every syntagmatic fracture, 
              fission, pericope a go-go, i cannot re-member one moment to the 
              next. Rather, i think it's crucial to acknowledge that member comes 
              from meme (as in a unit of cultural meaning virally replicating 
              itself across languages, cultures, codes) and thus would produce 
              a memetics of instability. A dis-membership or embership of traces, 
              residues, specters, ghosts and hauntings. i want to join a membership 
              that feverishly hangs on to some loose sense of fractured assembly. 
              For, when what is same is always different, and “every other is 
              every bit other,” i am smothered, bothered&nbsp; by a notion of 
              bonding and community, when, really i am just obsessed with commuting.

              and in what language but HOW. It must call into question institutions,

              <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
              my desk, crammed atop stacks of poetry books and holding down scraps 
              and scraps of loose paper, balances (precariously) the dented plastic 
              globe I’ve had since grade three.&nbsp; I always loved the bumps 
              and ridges that embroider each continent, the red, green and black 
              lines that interrupt the oceans, the countries so clearly designated 
              by colour and borders.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Had 
              I heard the word “globalization” in grade three, I would have known 
              it to be a word that perfectly describes the teetering spin that 
              sets my globe careening round and round, the pivot of a finger that 
              both halts the spinning and randomly chooses: a dot on the map, 
              a place to happen upon, a global coincidence.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Then––and 
              now––I spun my rickety globe in anticipation of where my finger 
              might land (the Kara Sea or Hyderabad? Dar es Salaam or Reindeer 
              Lake?). I spun out of nervous habit (probably how the globe came 
              to be rickety and unstable) and with delight that, so easily, I 
              could set the world speeding speeding––faster than my eyes.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              word, globalization, has come to mean everything and nothing. It’s 
              a catch-word for advertisers who wish to expand their marketing 
              plans into countries other than where they locate their home-base. 
              It’s the reason fewer Spanish people take siestas, instead of more 
              North Americans emulating the practice. It’s a description of how 
              fewer and fewer languages express more and more business and social 
              exchanges. Globalized thinking allows the political, religious, 
              economic, and environmental concerns of one region swiftly to become 
              the concerns of an entirely distinct region. It also sometimes forces 
              the cares of one group onto the backs of others. Globalization, 
              for me, means I get to eat out-of-season fruit and watch Czech movies 
              dubbed into English; at the same time, globalization ensures that 
              supermarkets sell Florida oranges often in place of B.C. fresh fruit, 
              and that French-language Canadian films rarely play in English Canada’s 
              cinemas.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
              one and the same time, I’m irritated by people who resent “globalization” 
              because they do not wish to expand their ideas of the world farther 
              than their backyard fences, and I fear a capitulation to the “globalization” 
              that compels farmers to grow questionable or dubious crops.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But, 
              like most people, I’m ignorant of the economic and environmental 
              ramifications of a life-sized globe, spinning out of control. Which 
              means, rather than ostrich myself in some vague and ridiculous notion 
              of apolitical writing (“how can writers possibly know or change 
              politics?”), that, as a writer, I must investigate these issues 
              as they are represented <i>textually</i>.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
              a writer, the increasing availability of texts not originally written 
              in English has helped my thinking and my written work. I value the 
              easy access I have to texts which make my heart lurch and my head 
              spin. I’m amazed and delighted when I receive emails from German 
              or Spanish readers who have encountered my writing. Such interchange 
              generates dialogue, generates––for me––<i>thinking</i>. As a writer 
              (and especially as a poet?), part of my job is to write down my 
              thinking: my fears and hopes and worries and misgivings about the 
              glib assumptions about “global” and what such a tiny word might 
              mean to my world, their world, our world.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Erin 
              Mouré (or as she is known on her latest cover, Eirin Moure) has, 
              in her latest book, <i>Sheep’s Vigil by a Fervent Person</i>, written 
              an ecstatic series of translations of poetry by Alberto Caeiro, 
              one of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa’s literary personas. Mouré 
              shifts from the anonymity of a supposedly invisible translator to 
              the overtly discernible context of writer responding to writer. 
              She absorbs, displays, identifies, and claims Pessoa’s original 
              poem, even as she toys with and deflects their meanings. In this 
              way, Pessoa, who wrote his poetry almost a century ago, enters Toronto, 
              Canada at the same time Mouré does, and in the same way: through 
              words.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Appearing 
              sometimes as a character in her own words (in Pessoa’s words), Mouré 
              presents her poems on pages facing the original Portuguese. She 
              searches for creeks heard faintly through Toronto’s urban manhole 
              covers, and bends her smile to greet the mysterious choices that 
              words offer both sides of the page. One of the poems (Pessoa’s “XX,” 
              and Mouré’s “XX The Humber is pretty fabulous, really”) speaks to 
              the very particular location that each persona wishes to address.

            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mouré 
              not only hints as the imagination and concentration necessary to 
              see what is not there (at least not in the now), but she supplies 
              a concrete Canadian-specific image to her reader, an example of 
              one of the many “not there”s we do not see. For most Torontonians, 
              there is no actual “memory” of a canoe-travelled past. But this 
              line, punctuating the end of the stanza, reminds readers to remember 
              what the official story itself has prepared most Ontario residents 
              to forget. The threads connecting forgotten past to overlaid present 
              are the creek under the persona’s avenue and the Humber streaming 
              its way, ultimately, almost to Niagara Falls. She ends the poem 
              by saying, “The creek under my avenue makes no one think of anything. 
              / Whoever goes to the edge of it has only reached the curb,” and 
              yet the “edge” of the avenue/creek curbs/curves into the Portuguese 
              on the next page. In the same way that flat maps lead from the edge 
              of one country to the depth of an ocean on the other side of the 
              planet, so too do these poems veer from English to Portuguese, from 
              then to now, from specific detail to also but different specific 
              detail.</font></p>

            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 
              the early nineties, when global cultural inextricability was becoming 
              more and more obvious to me, I’ve been advocating polylingualism 
              as a primary “poethical” strategy for the world context in which 
              we live—one of electronic and live intercultural intimacy. The poethical 
              imperative as I see it is to make art as forms of life that help 
              us live with vitality, and even joy, in a world whose complexity 
              (including the Babel effect) might otherwise be experienced as entirely 
              overwhelming. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
              there’s a big difference between “polylingualism” and “multi” or 
              “trans” nationalism, not to say globalization. The experimental 
              practitioners of polylingualism whose work most interests me are 
              those who are precisely counter to the homogenizing, transcendent 
              and universalizing implications of such terms. They are working 
              with the intricate vectors and textures of several languages at 
              once, demonstrating incommensurability (untranslatability) by a 
              simultaneous presentation that is in fact a refusal to translate. 
              Anne Tardos’s <i>Cat Licked the Garlic</i> is a lovely example of 
              this—a book written in the four languages (English, German, Hungarian, 
              French) of Tardos’s childhood, none subordinate to any other. The 
              structure of the book implies a readership of all four categories 
              of native speaker each of whom can find homophonic pleasures in 
              the “other” (unfamiliar) languages. This work enacts an ethos of 
              joyous simultaneity, rather than dominance. The languages are not 
              competing, not attempting to obliterate (translate) one another; 
              they are in conversation (literally, turning toward one another 
              for infusions of aesthetic energy). I’d like to think that the time 
              has come when polylingual persons no longer feel they must choose 
              one language that suppresses all others—to become a writer in English, 
              say, extinguishing not only untranslatable expressions and vocabularies, 
              but a sense of “foreignness” that might jar the ear of the reader. 
              Jarring the ear of the reader is important for any kind of social 
              change. The jarred ear is alive to difference in the world. Jarring 
              can become a pleasurable, erotic rather than exotic, excitation.

            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              fifth issue of the magazine <i>Chain</i> (“Different Languages,” 
              eds. Jena Osman, Juliana Spahr, Janet Zweig) as well as much of 
              my own work (most recently <i>MONGRELISME</i>) and more and more 
              of the work coming, particularly, out of urban areas explores the 
              all-terrain language vehicles of mongrelized sensibilities. This 
              quite contrary to political agendas—rules of borders and identity—takes 
              place in the realm of aesthetics—dynamic systems of the sensual 
              intellect that create atmospheres of possibility within cultural 
              climates. Cultural climates, as gossamer and subject to capricious 
              shifts as they can be, are nonetheless the only direct source of 
              transformative ethical and political thought we have.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hence, 
              polylingualism is an aesthetic—not political—principle that draws 
              its energies from the polylingual cultural ambience in which we 
              experience our everyday lives. Think, for instance, of how directions, 
              instructions for the most common objects and experiences, CD liner 
              notes, etc. are now routinely printed in six or more languages.&nbsp; 
              Think of the number of languages, dialects, accents one hears walking 
              a few blocks in any large urban environment. The poethics in using 
              this ambient polylingualism as material for a poesis—a making of 
              an aesthetic form of life out of the events in ordinary life—is 
              a valuing, a foregrounding, of the most crucial fact of our existence: 
              We, in all our reciprocal alterities, are “in it” together; everything 
              depends on the quality of the conversation we can manage between 
              ourselves and ourselves and the natural world.&nbsp; Those reciprocal 
              alterities of race, class, gender, religion, age, species…. prime 
              us for intolerance and misunderstanding. An inherently messy polylingualism 
              is intelligently transgressive of nationalist grammars while coming 
              out of nothing other than one’s situatedness in a specific time 
              and place. The caveat is of course that in today’s world every specific 
              time and place is intersected by global information, every “local” 
              is affected by, is part of global weather.&nbsp; It’s the mix that’s 
              simultaneously exhilarating, unintelligible, potentially richer 
              than any one can presently imagine, daunting, exhausting, frustrating, 
              full of emerging patterns we have much and little to do with…..The 
              point is not to transcend it, but to live in it, in conversation 
              and collaboration, to make (<i>poesis</i>) the best of it, to rise 
              to the occasion of our improbably situated, compound otherness.</font></p>

              women’s experimental verse, and we have certainly moved a long way 
              in this respect. When I first joined the experimental poetry scene 
              in England in the mid-eighties, the people who encouraged me were 
              mainly men, and it was difficult to obtain texts by experimental 
              women writers from other countries. The proliferation of anthologies, 
              the availability of material on the internet, email, and increased

              scouting’ of editors such as Susan Schultz and Elizabeth Treadwell 
              are all interventions which are helping to counteract this.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              formulations on which this forum are based, however, deserve close 
              scrutiny, because they could be said to suppress the very differences 
              they are designed to foreground. For example, the concept of a “community 
              in women’s experimental verse” inadvertently espouses the uni-vers(e)-lising 
              principle it attempts to undercut, and conveys the sense of a homogenous, 
              bounded and static group, purged of stylistic, political and gender 
              differences. In addition the term “experimental” is the product 
              of a particular westernised perspective, a stylistic opposition 
              to the artistic mainstream, which is not necessarily relevant to 
              non-western poetries. And the word “verse” collapses the fertile 
              range of stylistic variations between experimental writers, whose 
              habitus may be the prose poem, the electronic media, the visual 
              arts, or performance. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              idea of an Anglo-American imperium might also need some modification. 
              Even though English is hegemonic as a language, American poetry 
              has been, and still is, much more dominant than British poetry (particularly 
              amongst American critics).&nbsp; And it is difficult, I think, to 
              maintain a binary opposition between English and non-English poetries 
              in terms of their inclusion, or exclusion, as part of a transnational 
              community. This is not only because of the complex position of migrant 
              poets, but also because poets in general from a location such as 
              Australia have had difficulty in taking their place within the international 
              poetry community, due to problems of distance and perception. For 
              example, the work of writers such as Ania Walwicz and Anna Couani, 
              who became prominent as experimental writers in Australia fifteen 
              to twenty years ago, would still not be very well known in America 
              and England: Australian writers have also not generally been included 
              in anthologies of women’s writing such as <i>Out of Everywhere</i>. 
              And while Ann Vickery’s<i> Leaving Lines of Gender</i> is a major 
              study by an Australian of American women’s poetry, the reverse situation 
              (an American publishing a comparable study of contemporary Australian 
              women’s writing) seems some way ahead. Nevertheless, the situation 
              is changing at an enormous speed, particularly because the internet 
              is making the work of younger Australian poets more available.</font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              would therefore theorise my own ideal as a community of difference, 
              itself a collection of <i>communities </i>which work in constantly 
              shifting alignments across formal interests, ethnicities, sexualities, 
              the mainstream and the popular—and also, some of the time, across 
              gender. I believe it is important that such a community is interactive 
              and critical, so that we do not only support each other, but also 
              challenge each other’s assumptions and outputs. There are communities 
              of women working in areas as diverse as prose poetry, performance, 
              visual texts and cyberpoetry. But awareness of work in different 
              areas can be quite low —those interested in page-based poetry for 
              example, may be relatively uninformed about work by women such as 
              Christy Sheffield Sanford in the new media. Similarly, we need to 
              take account of groups of women (such as indigenous American and 
              Australian writers) who work in opposition to the political mainstream, 
              without assimilating them into largely westernised ideas of experimentalism. 
              In Australia, for example, the powerful political critiques of Anita 
              Heiss are radical in a different way from the linguistic experiments 
              of Geraldine McKenzie. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Experimentalism 
              also varies from place to place: what it means to be experimental 
              in Australia is different from what it means in America, and the 
              range is quite broad. It includes the poetry of Emma Lew, which 
              pivots on a dramatic disjuncture rather different from the linguistic 
              or semantic disjuncture characteristic of language writing. But 
              it also includes the fictocritical writing of Anne Brewster which 
              crosses the boundaries between theory and creative writing, prose 
              and poetry, writer and critic, and demonstrates a cultural empathy 
              both with indigenous women’s writing and American language writing. 
              It is a continuing challenge for a journal like <i>HOW2 </i>to make 
              sure that it does not ossify into nostalgic celebration of the language 
              writing heritage (however much we might admire such work) but keeps 
              representation of women’s experimental writing fluid, transnational 
              and constantly evolving. This challenge is met in recent <i>HOW2</i> 
              features on Australian and British women’s writing edited by Debbie 
              Commerford and Caroline Bergvall, which bring together different 
              poetries across a variety of different stylistic, ethnic and technological 
              divides.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
              the critic there can be a considerable tension between the wish 
              to preserve the distinctiveness of experimental writing and the 
              need to address poetries which are written from very different cultural, 
              linguistic and formal perspectives. What is required are theoretical 
              frameworks which more readily take accounts of alignments between 
              poetic communities, without assimilating one to the other. When 
              I spoke and wrote about sonic poetries some years ago, I was keen 
              to address the matter of gender imbalance in the history of sound 
              poetry, which I saw as a precursor to what I called “new sonic poetries.” 
              I was amazed by the way in which two major collections of sound 
              poetry contained no work by women. I also addressed the way that 
              some poets were using linguistic de-formation to confront ethnic 
              and national differences. However my accounts did not draw—beyond 
              a passing mention—on other kinds of oral poetry such as rap or Jamaican 
              dub poetry––and I now see this as an unnecessary form of exclusion. 
              The main reason I did not include them was that performance poetries 
              such as rap and dub seemed to employ a syntax which was radically 
              dissimilar to the asyntactic musical and linguistic structures which 
              characterised my own sonic collaborations and the work of other 
              ”experimental” sonic poets, such as Amanda Stewart. Dub and rap 
              sounded different to me, had different objectives, and also seemed 
              closer to popular culture. I realise now, however, that a theoretical 
              framework which stressed cultural alignments more fully, and was 
              less hemmed in by definitions of the experimental, might have allowed 
              me to be more inclusive. I could have pointed out similarities while 
              maintaining fundamental differences, and without subordinating one 
              cultural perspective to the other. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              also think we need to address, theoretically, the fact that writers 
              often do not live continuously in one place. Most anthologies and 
              critical commentaries are still assembled as if people lived their 
              lives always in the same place, or as if they migrated to a single 
              permanent destination. This seems short-sighted because a creative 
              and celebratory engagement with continuous displacement is symptomatic 
              of globalisation. “The poet who travels” (the title of one of my 
              recent prose poems!) is becoming commonplace, and may be one of 
              the main ways in which poetry addresses the tension between the 
              local and the global. At the very least the notion of the geographical 
              <i>movement </i>of experimental women writers, typical of globalisation, 
              needs to be more fully addressed. </font></p>
            <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Finally, 
              unless we are all prepared to make a lot more effort to be multi-lingual—and 
              perhaps this should be one of our goals—the hegemonic hold of the 
              English language seems to me to be fairly intractable. However, 
              I still believe we can make powerful interventions to interrupt 
              this domination, and many poets do. Parallel versions of text in 
              different languages can be juxtaposed to create an interaction between 
              them, creating a stimulating ‘take’ on the process of translation.&nbsp; 
              And English can be pushed beyond itself and—as it is in the work 
              of Maggie O’Sullivan and many others—made to both evoke other languages 
              and register their absence in English. Particularly important is 
              the role of mixed media work which relies less on language, and 
              more on trans-linguistic phenomena such as images and sound, for 
              communication—despite their various exclusions, sound and concrete 
              poetry in the middle of the last century were awesomely successful 
              in their capacity to communicate over linguistic boundaries. There 
              is room for optimism here, and the potential to harness relationships 
              between text, image and sound, in ways which undercut the dominance 
              of any one verbal language, is an understated aspect of the new 
              media. It is likely to have radical effects on our writing, and 
              our sense of connection as writers, in ways which go far beyond 
              the simple availability of material on the internet. </font></p>
