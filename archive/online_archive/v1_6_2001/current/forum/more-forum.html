              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writing 
                from an Australian context it is difficult to think about “women’s 
                experimental writing” as anything other than a luxurious indulgence––whether 
                local or global. But there are, of course, many experimental women 
                writers here. There is great value in “experimentation” in its disruption 
                of existing oppressions and its obvious undermining of power. Poetry’s 
                verticality and lineation guarantees its placement in the “experimental 
                writing” category. In my own work I have tended to code and abstract 
                out from the quotidian &amp; the colloquial and by floating or severely 
                shortening the lines, my aim is to achieve an opposition to restrictive 
                forms and “conservative” lyrical and linear poetry.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
                this country it has been too easy to forget, or to deny that the 
                land was stolen by whites and that “we” are responsible for the 
                actions of the earlier colonisers––even though many of “us” are 
                immigrants or have arrived recently. In this situation, in order 
                to reconcile past misdemeanours, it is absolutely necessary that 
                the local dominate at this point in time. But I can’t see how didacticism 
                could have any use or give any pleasure to a reader––so I react 
                against it. All I can do is assist indigenous writers in coming 
                to the attention of readers.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, 
                here, it’s a tricky time for experimentation. Australia is an extremely 
                diverse, multicultural society. Here, we call many people NESBs––people 
                from Non-English-Speaking Backgrounds. (This is probably an international 
                acronym). Generations of these people have influenced Australian 
                culture-at-large, especially since the second world war, Korean 
                war and Vietnamese war, the bombing of Lebanon, the Gulf war, Tiananmen 
                Square incidents in China, Bosnia-Herzogovinian war, the East-Timorese 
                struggle for independence and so on, as waves of refugees and immigrants, 
                including writers and other artists, have settled here.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">English 
                is my language. I have the usual Euro-centric smatterings of romance 
                languages and, once, I attempted to learn Vietnamese. I regret the 
                dominance of English over other languages.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’m 
                not “fascinated” by the untranslatability of poetry. I’m saddened 
                and frustrated by it. I’ve participated in translation workshops 
                at the “Festival franco-anglais de poésie” in Paris. Although the 
                experience was enriching, untranslatability was the conclusion. 
                There is so much writing that I have read ONLY in translation.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
                does seem to be a transnational “community” of women experimenters––but 
                I am only aware of this because of the internet and it does seem 
                to be mostly led by women from the United States. I don’t see this 
                as hindering women writers but then I write &amp; read in English.</font><br>

              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                aesthetic world of the Australian word artist thalia is a veritable 
                mine of poetic <i>and</i> political possibilities for visual expression.&nbsp; 
                The chief mode of thalia’s compositions is Pitman’s Shorthand, a 
                now antiquated system of secretarial notation widely used by stenographers 
                through the 1970s.&nbsp; By arranging such shorthand symbols on 
                the page, providing a key at the bottom of the page to decipher 
                for the reader the symbols' meanings, and giving the poem a title 
                that locates the subtext of its iconography, thalia produces poems 
                of extraordinary elaboration, subtlety, and conscience.&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Karl 
                Young says that thalia’s method of writing “completely recast(s) 
                and reform(s) an existing writing system, without making it arcane 
                or inaccessible to many readers throughout the world”(<a href="http://www.concentric.net/%7Elndb/thalia/kthal00.htm" target="_blank">“thalia:&nbsp; 
                a survey”</a>).&nbsp;The prior system Young alludes to is of course 
                shorthand, insinuating that thalia reconstitutes the shorthand form 
                by removing it from its cultural circumstance and installing it 
                in the discourse of art, thus attributing an aesthetic function 
                to the writing rather than merely its original, practical denotation.&nbsp; 
                thalia transforms what once was a language of the female administrator 
                in the corporate world into a code of artistic declaration that 
                enfranchises the feminine artist, transforming the subordinate into 
                the subversive.&nbsp; As Young remarks: “On one level, thalia’s 
                subversion of this language suggests a revolt against authority 
                of all sorts; on another level, it suggests a revolt against the 
                arrogance of wealth and power; on perhaps yet another, it could 
                suggest just how much rebellion of secretaries [then and now] could 
                bring the industrial world to a screeching halt.”&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">thalia’s 
                appropriation of the underlings’ language to exercise a voice of 
                artistic agency has obvious political undertones of both class and 
                gender.&nbsp; However, the dimension of cultural critique in her 
                poetry extends beyond the impact of the medium.&nbsp; With poems 
                such as “Army,” “nuclear fears,” and “Desert Storm,” thalia composes 
                visual images that resonate within current counter-ideological thought 
                and explicitly draw attention to the contentious relationships of 
                the State.&nbsp; Yet the central notion of each poem is thoroughly 
                felt in the plainness of its language, hence thalia’s ability to 
                not “mak(e) it arcane or inaccessible to many readers throughout 
                the world.”&nbsp; Ironically, it is the abstractness (and therefore 
                minimalism and simplicity) of the visual designs that make them 
                accessible “to many readers throughout the world.”&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
                the artistic impulse to compose in the abstract visual form has 
                very esoteric roots; in the literary avant-gardes of Futurism, Dadaism, 
                and Concretism, elite circles of artists in select urban enclaves 
                dialogue with(in) the university and are protected by the Arts.&nbsp; 
                The established literary sense that enables visual poetics is far 
                removed from the ordinary mass appeal implied by Young's perception 
                of thalia’s creations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one enables the other, 
                as the meaning of thalia’s visual poems conforms to both theory 
                and simplicity.&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
                this is the brilliance of thalia’s work.&nbsp; Within the context 
                of globalization and experimentation in women’s poetries, thalia’s 
                shorthand poems exemplify the nexus of possibilities available for 
                contemporary expression.&nbsp; The aesthetic of concrete poetry 
                visible in her work borrows from the Brazilian and German avant-garde 
                of the 1950s, while the shorthand comes from the corporate world 
                of the Anglophone woman pre-1980s, and the poems’ themes reflect 
                more recent political turmoil such as the Persian Gulf War and expanding 
                nuclear armament.&nbsp; The diversity of inspirational resources 
                refracted in thalia’s poetry exhibits an extraordinarily sophisticated 
                level of poetic process, one that weaves together the political 
                and the aesthetic in ways that minimize the matter of writing by 
                encoding it simultaneously with social critique and literary theory.&nbsp; 
                thalia’s shorthand poems demonstrate not only a present but a future 
                for the continuing globalization of subaltern poetries, one that 
                necessarily engages narrative and style, the histories of people 
                as well as of scripture.&nbsp; Both are vital to the global experiment, 
                and no one shows it more starkly than thalia.</font></p>

                from the vantage point of those who do not consider the Western, 
                Western (or the Eastern, Eastern), of those who do not regard the 
                Anglophone World as the next best emergence to that of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, 
                there, where poetry exists with no qualifier, is where I go and 
                therefore am––race, gender, class, religion, regardless––there, 
                a swarm, a transnational community, always marginal and post-colonial, 
                always coming through. The Anglophone World cannot draw the swarm 
                into complicity or eccentricity, rather, is itself transformed into 
                one of the many scapegoats to the ongoing proliferation of <i>Gesellschaft</i> 
                (society) vs. <i>Gemeinschaft</i> (community), of materialism/consumerism/capitalism, 
                sailing through the pearly gates of “democratization,” enhancing 
                desire while multiplying signs and aesthetic values, and poetry 
                (art) is waning. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Globalization 
                is yet another phenomenon the Anglophone (digital) World has created. 
                Therein lies discomfort due to proximity. But the poet is always 
                experiencing discomfort, regardless of proximity or distance (most 
                preferring distance, as it orders, provides neutrality, transformation). 
                Distance need not evaporate in the presence of globalization, however, 
                and it would not, if we were to withstand the demands of conformity 
                cast by the information age, by its sucking (perforation) through 
                the surveillance and management of desire, withering the senses, 
                ethics, our voice. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                mist of philosophy hovers around art. Still, the lag between cultural 
                practice and the theorization of that practice prevails, as does 
                the lag between poetry and literature. We are thankful for that. 
                Personal and cultural histories linger in the body memory of the 
                globalized and transnational poet. No need to be concerned with 
                the translatability or not of the poem. There is no <i>Gestalt</i>, 
                no <i>Bildung, </i>when it comes to poetry. Linguistic and cultural 
                specificity can be experienced (if at all necessary) in ways other 
                than translation. The poem is beyond labels (the work was never 
                conceived, let alone created by a poet). Poetry comes from feeling—a 
                universal experience—such that literary theory and thought need 
                not create clones as they transverse the organs of the poet, the 
                organs that vary according to his or her sensibilities. There is 
                always simulation. Simulation suggests, therefore, may be considered 
                good enough. The theme song from the film <i>Love Story</i> simulates 
                Oum Kulthoum’s <i>Anta ’Omri</i>; more so with different periods, 
                as in Peter Maxwell Davis’ <i>Black Pentecost</i> simulating Kurt

                identity. Premised on patriarchal relations of the reproduction

                next. Rather, i think it's crucial to acknowledge that member comes 
                from meme (as in a unit of cultural meaning virally replicating 
                itself across languages, cultures, codes) and thus would produce

                <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
                my desk, crammed atop stacks of poetry books and holding down scraps 
                and scraps of loose paper, balances (precariously) the dented plastic 
                globe I’ve had since grade three.&nbsp; I always loved the bumps 
                and ridges that embroider each continent, the red, green and black 
                lines that interrupt the oceans, the countries so clearly designated 
                by colour and borders.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Had 
                I heard the word “globalization” in grade three, I would have known 
                it to be a word that perfectly describes the teetering spin that 
                sets my globe careening round and round, the pivot of a finger that 
                both halts the spinning and randomly chooses: a dot on the map, 
                a place to happen upon, a global coincidence.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Then––and 
                now––I spun my rickety globe in anticipation of where my finger 
                might land (the Kara Sea or Hyderabad? Dar es Salaam or Reindeer 
                Lake?). I spun out of nervous habit (probably how the globe came 
                to be rickety and unstable) and with delight that, so easily, I 
                could set the world speeding speeding––faster than my eyes.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                word, globalization, has come to mean everything and nothing. It’s 
                a catch-word for advertisers who wish to expand their marketing 
                plans into countries other than where they locate their home-base. 
                It’s the reason fewer Spanish people take siestas, instead of more 
                North Americans emulating the practice. It’s a description of how 
                fewer and fewer languages express more and more business and social 
                exchanges. Globalized thinking allows the political, religious, 
                economic, and environmental concerns of one region swiftly to become 
                the concerns of an entirely distinct region. It also sometimes forces 
                the cares of one group onto the backs of others. Globalization, 
                for me, means I get to eat out-of-season fruit and watch Czech movies 
                dubbed into English; at the same time, globalization ensures that 
                supermarkets sell Florida oranges often in place of B.C. fresh fruit, 
                and that French-language Canadian films rarely play in English Canada’s 
                cinemas.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
                one and the same time, I’m irritated by people who resent “globalization” 
                because they do not wish to expand their ideas of the world farther 
                than their backyard fences, and I fear a capitulation to the “globalization” 
                that compels farmers to grow questionable or dubious crops.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But, 
                like most people, I’m ignorant of the economic and environmental 
                ramifications of a life-sized globe, spinning out of control. Which 
                means, rather than ostrich myself in some vague and ridiculous notion 
                of apolitical writing (“how can writers possibly know or change 
                politics?”), that, as a writer, I must investigate these issues 
                as they are represented <i>textually</i>.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
                a writer, the increasing availability of texts not originally written 
                in English has helped my thinking and my written work. I value the 
                easy access I have to texts which make my heart lurch and my head 
                spin. I’m amazed and delighted when I receive emails from German 
                or Spanish readers who have encountered my writing. Such interchange 
                generates dialogue, generates––for me––<i>thinking</i>. As a writer 
                (and especially as a poet?), part of my job is to write down my 
                thinking: my fears and hopes and worries and misgivings about the 
                glib assumptions about “global” and what such a tiny word might 
                mean to my world, their world, our world.</font></p>

                Mouré (or as she is known on her latest cover, Eirin Moure) has, 
                in her latest book, <i>Sheep’s Vigil by a Fervent Person</i>, written 
                an ecstatic series of translations of poetry by Alberto Caeiro, 
                one of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa’s literary personas. Mouré 
                shifts from the anonymity of a supposedly invisible translator to 
                the overtly discernible context of writer responding to writer. 
                She absorbs, displays, identifies, and claims Pessoa’s original 
                poem, even as she toys with and deflects their meanings. In this 
                way, Pessoa, who wrote his poetry almost a century ago, enters Toronto, 
                Canada at the same time Mouré does, and in the same way: through 
                words.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Appearing 
                sometimes as a character in her own words (in Pessoa’s words), Mouré 
                presents her poems on pages facing the original Portuguese. She 
                searches for creeks heard faintly through Toronto’s urban manhole 
                covers, and bends her smile to greet the mysterious choices that 
                words offer both sides of the page. One of the poems (Pessoa’s “XX,” 
                and Mouré’s “XX The Humber is pretty fabulous, really”) speaks to 
                the very particular location that each persona wishes to address.

              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mouré 
                not only hints as the imagination and concentration necessary to 
                see what is not there (at least not in the now), but she supplies 
                a concrete Canadian-specific image to her reader, an example of 
                one of the many “not there”s we do not see. For most Torontonians, 
                there is no actual “memory” of a canoe-travelled past. But this 
                line, punctuating the end of the stanza, reminds readers to remember 
                what the official story itself has prepared most Ontario residents 
                to forget. The threads connecting forgotten past to overlaid present 
                are the creek under the persona’s avenue and the Humber streaming 
                its way, ultimately, almost to Niagara Falls. She ends the poem 
                by saying, “The creek under my avenue makes no one think of anything. 
                / Whoever goes to the edge of it has only reached the curb,” and 
                yet the “edge” of the avenue/creek curbs/curves into the Portuguese 
                on the next page. In the same way that flat maps lead from the edge 
                of one country to the depth of an ocean on the other side of the 
                planet, so too do these poems veer from English to Portuguese, from 
                then to now, from specific detail to also but different specific 
                detail.</font></p>

              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 
                the early nineties, when global cultural inextricability was becoming 
                more and more obvious to me, I’ve been advocating polylingualism 
                as a primary “poethical” strategy for the world context in which 
                we live—one of electronic and live intercultural intimacy. The poethical 
                imperative as I see it is to make art as forms of life that help 
                us live with vitality, and even joy, in a world whose complexity 
                (including the Babel effect) might otherwise be experienced as entirely 
                overwhelming. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
                there’s a big difference between “polylingualism” and “multi” or 
                “trans” nationalism, not to say globalization. The experimental 
                practitioners of polylingualism whose work most interests me are 
                those who are precisely counter to the homogenizing, transcendent 
                and universalizing implications of such terms. They are working 
                with the intricate vectors and textures of several languages at 
                once, demonstrating incommensurability (untranslatability) by a 
                simultaneous presentation that is in fact a refusal to translate. 
                Anne Tardos’s <i>Cat Licked the Garlic</i> is a lovely example of 
                this—a book written in the four languages (English, German, Hungarian, 
                French) of Tardos’s childhood, none subordinate to any other. The 
                structure of the book implies a readership of all four categories 
                of native speaker each of whom can find homophonic pleasures in 
                the “other” (unfamiliar) languages. This work enacts an ethos of 
                joyous simultaneity, rather than dominance. The languages are not 
                competing, not attempting to obliterate (translate) one another; 
                they are in conversation (literally, turning toward one another 
                for infusions of aesthetic energy). I’d like to think that the time 
                has come when polylingual persons no longer feel they must choose 
                one language that suppresses all others—to become a writer in English, 
                say, extinguishing not only untranslatable expressions and vocabularies, 
                but a sense of “foreignness” that might jar the ear of the reader. 
                Jarring the ear of the reader is important for any kind of social 
                change. The jarred ear is alive to difference in the world. Jarring 
                can become a pleasurable, erotic rather than exotic, excitation.

                my own work (most recently <i>MONGRELISME</i>) and more and more 
                of the work coming, particularly, out of urban areas explores the 
                all-terrain language vehicles of mongrelized sensibilities. This 
                quite contrary to political agendas—rules of borders and identity—takes 
                place in the realm of aesthetics—dynamic systems of the sensual 
                intellect that create atmospheres of possibility within cultural 
                climates. Cultural climates, as gossamer and subject to capricious 
                shifts as they can be, are nonetheless the only direct source of 
                transformative ethical and political thought we have.&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hence, 
                polylingualism is an aesthetic—not political—principle that draws 
                its energies from the polylingual cultural ambience in which we 
                experience our everyday lives. Think, for instance, of how directions, 
                instructions for the most common objects and experiences, CD liner 
                notes, etc. are now routinely printed in six or more languages.&nbsp; 
                Think of the number of languages, dialects, accents one hears walking 
                a few blocks in any large urban environment. The poethics in using 
                this ambient polylingualism as material for a poesis—a making of 
                an aesthetic form of life out of the events in ordinary life—is 
                a valuing, a foregrounding, of the most crucial fact of our existence: 
                We, in all our reciprocal alterities, are “in it” together; everything 
                depends on the quality of the conversation we can manage between 
                ourselves and ourselves and the natural world.&nbsp; Those reciprocal 
                alterities of race, class, gender, religion, age, species…. prime 
                us for intolerance and misunderstanding. An inherently messy polylingualism 
                is intelligently transgressive of nationalist grammars while coming 
                out of nothing other than one’s situatedness in a specific time 
                and place. The caveat is of course that in today’s world every specific 
                time and place is intersected by global information, every “local” 
                is affected by, is part of global weather.&nbsp; It’s the mix that’s 
                simultaneously exhilarating, unintelligible, potentially richer

              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
                think there is an emergent sense of a transnational community in 
                women’s experimental verse, and we have certainly moved a long way 
                in this respect. When I first joined the experimental poetry scene 
                in England in the mid-eighties, the people who encouraged me were 
                mainly men, and it was difficult to obtain texts by experimental 
                women writers from other countries. The proliferation of anthologies, 
                the availability of material on the internet, email, and increased 
                numbers of relevant conferences, have radically altered this situation. 
                There are still exclusions, hierarchies and omissions. But the laudable 
                appointment of an Australian, Ann Vickery, as editor of <i>HOW2</i>;<i> 
                </i>the presence of magazines such as <i>Tinfish</i> which highlight 
                the work of poets in particular regions; and the international ‘talent 
                scouting’ of editors such as Susan Schultz and Elizabeth Treadwell 
                are all interventions which are helping to counteract this.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                formulations on which this forum are based, however, deserve close 
                scrutiny, because they could be said to suppress the very differences 
                they are designed to foreground. For example, the concept of a “community 
                in women’s experimental verse” inadvertently espouses the uni-vers(e)-lising 
                principle it attempts to undercut, and conveys the sense of a homogenous, 
                bounded and static group, purged of stylistic, political and gender 
                differences. In addition the term “experimental” is the product 
                of a particular westernised perspective, a stylistic opposition 
                to the artistic mainstream, which is not necessarily relevant to 
                non-western poetries. And the word “verse” collapses the fertile 
                range of stylistic variations between experimental writers, whose 
                habitus may be the prose poem, the electronic media, the visual 
                arts, or performance. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
                idea of an Anglo-American imperium might also need some modification. 
                Even though English is hegemonic as a language, American poetry 
                has been, and still is, much more dominant than British poetry (particularly 
                amongst American critics).&nbsp; And it is difficult, I think, to 
                maintain a binary opposition between English and non-English poetries 
                in terms of their inclusion, or exclusion, as part of a transnational 
                community. This is not only because of the complex position of migrant 
                poets, but also because poets in general from a location such as 
                Australia have had difficulty in taking their place within the international 
                poetry community, due to problems of distance and perception. For 
                example, the work of writers such as Ania Walwicz and Anna Couani, 
                who became prominent as experimental writers in Australia fifteen 
                to twenty years ago, would still not be very well known in America 
                and England: Australian writers have also not generally been included 
                in anthologies of women’s writing such as <i>Out of Everywhere</i>. 
                And while Ann Vickery’s<i> Leaving Lines of Gender</i> is a major 
                study by an Australian of American women’s poetry, the reverse situation 
                (an American publishing a comparable study of contemporary Australian 
                women’s writing) seems some way ahead. Nevertheless, the situation 
                is changing at an enormous speed, particularly because the internet 
                is making the work of younger Australian poets more available.</font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
                would therefore theorise my own ideal as a community of difference, 
                itself a collection of <i>communities </i>which work in constantly 
                shifting alignments across formal interests, ethnicities, sexualities, 
                the mainstream and the popular—and also, some of the time, across 
                gender. I believe it is important that such a community is interactive 
                and critical, so that we do not only support each other, but also 
                challenge each other’s assumptions and outputs. There are communities 
                of women working in areas as diverse as prose poetry, performance, 
                visual texts and cyberpoetry. But awareness of work in different 
                areas can be quite low —those interested in page-based poetry for 
                example, may be relatively uninformed about work by women such as 
                Christy Sheffield Sanford in the new media. Similarly, we need to 
                take account of groups of women (such as indigenous American and 
                Australian writers) who work in opposition to the political mainstream, 
                without assimilating them into largely westernised ideas of experimentalism. 
                In Australia, for example, the powerful political critiques of Anita 
                Heiss are radical in a different way from the linguistic experiments 
                of Geraldine McKenzie. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Experimentalism 
                also varies from place to place: what it means to be experimental 
                in Australia is different from what it means in America, and the 
                range is quite broad. It includes the poetry of Emma Lew, which 
                pivots on a dramatic disjuncture rather different from the linguistic 
                or semantic disjuncture characteristic of language writing. But 
                it also includes the fictocritical writing of Anne Brewster which 
                crosses the boundaries between theory and creative writing, prose 
                and poetry, writer and critic, and demonstrates a cultural empathy 
                both with indigenous women’s writing and American language writing. 
                It is a continuing challenge for a journal like <i>HOW2 </i>to make 
                sure that it does not ossify into nostalgic celebration of the language 
                writing heritage (however much we might admire such work) but keeps 
                representation of women’s experimental writing fluid, transnational 
                and constantly evolving. This challenge is met in recent <i>HOW2</i> 
                features on Australian and British women’s writing edited by Debbie 
                Commerford and Caroline Bergvall, which bring together different 
                poetries across a variety of different stylistic, ethnic and technological 
                divides.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
                the critic there can be a considerable tension between the wish 
                to preserve the distinctiveness of experimental writing and the 
                need to address poetries which are written from very different cultural, 
                linguistic and formal perspectives. What is required are theoretical 
                frameworks which more readily take accounts of alignments between 
                poetic communities, without assimilating one to the other. When 
                I spoke and wrote about sonic poetries some years ago, I was keen 
                to address the matter of gender imbalance in the history of sound 
                poetry, which I saw as a precursor to what I called “new sonic poetries.” 
                I was amazed by the way in which two major collections of sound 
                poetry contained no work by women. I also addressed the way that 
                some poets were using linguistic de-formation to confront ethnic 
                and national differences. However my accounts did not draw—beyond 
                a passing mention—on other kinds of oral poetry such as rap or Jamaican 
                dub poetry––and I now see this as an unnecessary form of exclusion. 
                The main reason I did not include them was that performance poetries 
                such as rap and dub seemed to employ a syntax which was radically 
                dissimilar to the asyntactic musical and linguistic structures which 
                characterised my own sonic collaborations and the work of other 
                ”experimental” sonic poets, such as Amanda Stewart. Dub and rap 
                sounded different to me, had different objectives, and also seemed 
                closer to popular culture. I realise now, however, that a theoretical 
                framework which stressed cultural alignments more fully, and was 
                less hemmed in by definitions of the experimental, might have allowed 
                me to be more inclusive. I could have pointed out similarities while 
                maintaining fundamental differences, and without subordinating one 
                cultural perspective to the other. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
                also think we need to address, theoretically, the fact that writers 
                often do not live continuously in one place. Most anthologies and 
                critical commentaries are still assembled as if people lived their 
                lives always in the same place, or as if they migrated to a single 
                permanent destination. This seems short-sighted because a creative 
                and celebratory engagement with continuous displacement is symptomatic 
                of globalisation. “The poet who travels” (the title of one of my 
                recent prose poems!) is becoming commonplace, and may be one of 
                the main ways in which poetry addresses the tension between the 
                local and the global. At the very least the notion of the geographical 
                <i>movement </i>of experimental women writers, typical of globalisation, 
                needs to be more fully addressed. </font></p>
              <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Finally, 
                unless we are all prepared to make a lot more effort to be multi-lingual—and 
                perhaps this should be one of our goals—the hegemonic hold of the 
                English language seems to me to be fairly intractable. However, 
                I still believe we can make powerful interventions to interrupt 
                this domination, and many poets do. Parallel versions of text in 
                different languages can be juxtaposed to create an interaction between 
                them, creating a stimulating ‘take’ on the process of translation.&nbsp; 
                And English can be pushed beyond itself and—as it is in the work 
                of Maggie O’Sullivan and many others—made to both evoke other languages 
                and register their absence in English. Particularly important is 
                the role of mixed media work which relies less on language, and 
                more on trans-linguistic phenomena such as images and sound, for 
                communication—despite their various exclusions, sound and concrete 
                poetry in the middle of the last century were awesomely successful 
                in their capacity to communicate over linguistic boundaries. There 
                is room for optimism here, and the potential to harness relationships 
                between text, image and sound, in ways which undercut the dominance 
                of any one verbal language, is an understated aspect of the new 
                media. It is likely to have radical effects on our writing, and 
                our sense of connection as writers, in ways which go far beyond 
                the simple availability of material on the internet. </font></p>
