          Byron’s  “Stanzas for Music.” This is the one part from the <i>Hebrew 
          Melodies</i> that he suppressed, allowing the other poems to be set to 
          music by Isaac Nathan. This strange model, the <b>model of absence</b>, 
          stands behind Susan Gevirtz’s <i>CAESAREA: Herod’s City </i>as metamodel, 
          containing and generating a structure of strange models. It silently introduces 
          and permits, “like the night,” the many intersecting and merging arms 
          or armatures (the woman’s hundred arms”—<i>Thrall</i>, Gevirtz) that create 
          the multiple rhythms, tones and trajectories of Gevirtz’s long poem<i>.</i>

          One of Byron’s <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, “Herod’s Lament for Mariamne,” 
          is cited in the transitional passage or threshold between the title on 
          the title page,</font></p>

          the title “C A E S A R E A : . : Herod’s City” at the top of page 29 where 
          the body/text of the poem begins—or continues, depending on where you 
          think it starts. About the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, poems written at the 
          request of composer Isaac Nathan, Byron writes to Annabella, his fiancée, 
          that his words would be accompanied by the “real old undisputed Hebrew 
          melodies which are beautiful and to which David &amp; the prophets actually 
          sang the ‘songs of Zion.’ It is odd enough that this should fall to my 
          lot, who have been abused as ‘an infidel.’ Augusta says ‘they will call 
          you a <i>Jew</i> next”(Benita Eisler).</font></p>

          “I speak not… thy name”—Augusta—the referent of that sign or name’s sake 
          was Byron’s beloved, his half-sister whose shadow haunts the <i>Hebrew 
          Melodies</i>. The suppressed poem from “Stanzas for Music” might be called 
          “Stanzas Forbidden” just as Gevirtz’s <i>CAESAREA :.: Herod’s City </i>might<i> 
          </i>be called “Stanzas Standing in for a Crime.” Behind and before <i>CAESAREA</i> 
          are crimes including the murder committed in name of inevitability, stand-in 
          for the suppressed<i> </i><b>model of the forbidden-to-be-called-by-its-name</b>, 
          in this case <b>beloved</b>, or what Laura Riding in her <i>Lives of Wives</i> 
          refers to as “The Silence of Mariamne.” The written inscription in my 
          copy of <i>CAESAREA</i> says “to which we reply / and we do.”</font></p>

          The poem <i>CAESAREA</i> will dismantle the strangely conventional <b>model 
          of power</b> represented by this fabulously constructed harbor.  On the 
          eastern shore of <i>Mare Nostrum</i>, the Mediterranean Sea, “… he lowered 
          blocks of limestone [in a different translation, “soft white stone”] into 
          twenty fathoms [in another account, twenty-five fathoms] of water, most 
          of them measuring fifty feet in length by nine in depth and ten in breadth, 
          some being even bigger”(Josephus).  This he is Herod, King of the Jews 
          and the husband and murderer of Mariamne and the subject of Byron’s poem.

          The harbor of Caesarea, named for Augustus Caesar who ceded much territory 
          to Herod in gratitude for his support, was the more ancient site of<i>

          <b>entrepôt</b> in the tradition or <b>model</b> of Delos and Rhodes, 
          Carthage, Alexandria, Troy, Aden, Palmyra, Petra, Bactria, Oc Eo, Peshawar,

          and do not meet a main character named Miriam Henderson—she is there when 
          we meet ourselves in the act of reading and so she is never actually there 
          without us.” Gevirtz quotes Stephen Heath: “‘Miriam’ is the possibility 
          of ‘mirror I am.’” Miriam and Mariamne are the same name, “…the basic 
          name known to the Chaldeans as Marratu, to the Jews as Marah, to the Persians
