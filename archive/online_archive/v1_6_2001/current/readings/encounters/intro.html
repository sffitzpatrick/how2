        <p align="left"><b><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Introduction 
          by Kimberly Lamm</font></b>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
          they are distinct in form, subject matter, and purpose, all the work within 
          this “Readings” section stage and investigate poetic encounters. I am 
          not speaking of encounters with literature, but rather, an attentive testing 
          of how literature illuminates and complicates the ways language structures 
          one’s encounter with the world.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Though 
          there are different levels of attention to politics and history in these 
          essays, each text resists a conception and practice of literature as, 
          in Joan Retallack’s description, a “time machine” that can imaginatively 
          enfold reader and writer, excluding the persistent ticking of the present 
          as it transforms into history. Many of the essays acknowledge that we 
          only encounter others through literature’s medium—language—and that literature 
          can—and does—forge attentive encounters between oneself and the world 
          of others. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her interview with Redell Olson, Retallack reminds us that making is at 
          the root of poesis. And many of these essays attempt to make or forge 
          into awareness John Cage’s definition of silence: “what we are not noticing 
          at any given moment.” In other words, these texts draw our attention to 
          encounters within language and culture that are present, but are not easily 
          or always perceived. This absence that inscribes its presence on the present 
          moment aligns with “the model of absence” Norma Cole shows us is at work 
          in Susan Gevirtz’s <i>CAESURA</i>. And in the essay that inspired my decision 
          to title </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">this 
          section “Poetics of Encounter,” Kate Fagan explains Lyn Hejinian’s conception 
          of the possibility within encounter: “for in encounters, we discover not 
          only our reasons, but evidence of our reasoning.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          evidence and reasoning elucidated by encounter often have contradictory 
          relations to power. As Susan M. Schultz reveals in her essay “The Stutter 
          in the Text: Editing and Historical Authority in the Work of Susan Howe,” 
          power is at stake in literary and historical encounters, especially in 
          texts such as Howe’s, which attempt to reshape the rhetorics of history 
          and “search for a new authority.” Howe is known as the poet who speaks 
          to and for the voices that have been rendered mute by history; Schultz’s 
          essay elucidates Howe’s complicated relations to the powers shaping the 
          tropes, exclusions, and valorizations of history. Howe is “captive” to 
          both her restrictions and her privileges as well as their uncanny repetitions 
          within her poetic dismantlings. Michael Eng’s essay “Among Murderers and 
          Madmen—Ingeborg Bachmann, Fascism, and the Experience of Writing” revisits 
          the space opened up between philosophy and writing in Bachmann’s 1959 
          Frankfurt lectures on poetics in order to draw attention to the persistence 
          of fascism in her work—“not only historical fascism,” as Michel Foucault 
          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">says, 
          “but the fascism within us all.” Eng argues that Bachman’s concern is 
          for the possibility of responding to “the experience of language” when 
          historical and personal experiences have been called into doubt by fascism.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          essays and the work they encounter pursue language as a medium of inquiry 
          and form as “a conduit of intention.” They are wary of rendering literature 
          as a mirror, wary of the political and ethical dangers of valorizing “being 
          for the other.” Perhaps this resistance to a mimetic model of literature 
          and the self stems from an awareness that women have so often served as 
          the conceptual and material ground that mirrors how male writers have 
          seen themselves. Susan Gevirtz’s essay on Norma Cole’s <i>Ruth</i> draws 
          attention to the figure of the mother as an unacknowledged structure of 
          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">absence. 
          Imitating patriarchal imperatives, Cole writes, “The mother better not 
          speak.” The mother’s “anonymous viligance” in silence becomes, in Gevirtz’s 
          words “something or someone that is not audible, or might be heard only 
          in the wings.” And yet, Cole’s innovative forms, and Gevirtz’s poetic 
          and critical encounter with those forms, makes that unheard voice present.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Perhaps 
          this is the ideal motivating all the essays in this section: illuminating 
          how a poetics of encounter allows us to hear and perceive the absence 
          that wouldn't be present otherwise.  </font></p>
