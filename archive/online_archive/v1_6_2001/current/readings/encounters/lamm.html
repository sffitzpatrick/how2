        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          asked Kristin Prevallet and Melissa Buzzeo if they would like to discuss 
          Lyn Hejinian’s <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>. I wanted to break beyond 
          the privacy and silence that usually defines my reading practice, not 
          only because this collection of essays addresses questions of community, 
          but because of its intellectual density. I thought that like many of 
          the best texts, like Gertrude Stein’s texts, the full complexity of 
          Hejinian’s work would emerge in the shared relay of a conversation. 
          Melissa and Kristin came to mind when I wanted to engage this formidable 
          but deceptively straightforward text because I knew they can be both 
          intellectually and emotionally responsive. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          met once without recording our conversation in order to see what sparked 
          our interests. Both Kristin and Melissa share my respect for <i>The 
          Language of Inquiry</i>; we all feel that it is an enactment of poetics 
          in the best sense; it is both about poetry and poetic in its own way; 
          it enlivens our understanding and appreciation for Hejinian’s poetry. 
          Hejinian describes herself and language itself as restless, but what 
          we all ending up appreciating about the book is its calm, meditative, 
          sustained intellectual pursuit. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Predictably, 
          different aspects of <i>The Language of Inquiry</i> piqued our individual 
          curiosities. Kristin was appreciative of Hejinian’s thoughts on poetic 
          form. Melissa was taken with the intertwining threads of spirituality 
          and time. I was interested in Gertrude Stein’s crucial presence in Hejinian's 
          thinking and the status of gender and feminism in <i>The Language of 
          Inquiry</i>. We decided we would come to the next conversation ready 
          with written introductions on these topics, and then the conversation 
          could develop from those individual framings.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Questions 
          about community evoked different and interesting responses from each 
          of us. We had varied knowledge and understanding of the so-called “<i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> 
          school” as a community of writers committed to defamiliarizing, highlighting, 
          and subverting the discursive layers of language that commodify, and 
          many senses determine American lives. While acknowledging that we always 
          already live and circulate within real and imaginary communities, we 
          articulated resistances to and suspicions of community: we have seen, 
          in a variety of personal and professional circumstances, the hypocrisies 
          of self-proclaimed communities. We also talked about risks and exposures, 
          and situations in which voices are often and predictably usurped, silenced. 
          These responses led us to questions and concerns about power and gender 
          and the predictable exclusions along those lines. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly: 
          </b>When I was thinking about how to approach Hejinian’s work through 
          the words feminism and gender, I thought about Virginia Woolf’s <i>A 
          Room of One’s Own</i> and the distinction she makes between Charlotte 
          Brontë’s and Jane Austen’s work. Brontë’s work reveals the cracks and 
          seams of rage; Austen’s work is polished and detached. Remarking on 
          an “awkward break” in <i>Jane Eyre, </i>Woolf writes: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One might 
          say...laying the book down beside <i>Pride and Prejudice, </i>that the 
                 woman who wrote those pages had more genius in her than Jane 
          Austen; but if    one reads them over and marks that jerk in them, that 
          indignation, one sees that   she will never get her genius expressed 
          whole and entire. Her books will be deformed and twisted. (69) </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          of Austen’s work, Woolf states, “Here was a woman about the year 1800 
          writing without hate, without bitterness, without fear, without protest, 
          without preaching”(68). I think Hejinian’s work could be described well 
          through this sentence; questions of gender and feminism are present 
          in her work, but there is not much struggle or anger, and it is obvious, 
          but worth saying, that Hejinian doesn’t foreground feminism and gender 
          as explicitly as many other writers of her generation do.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          don’t like discussing what a writer doesn’t do, especially when the 
          work is as rich and rewarding as Hejinian’s, but gender and feminism 
          are not pursued as much as I would have expected. And yet, Hejinian 
          does construct a genealogy of the <i>L=A=N= G=U=A=G=E</i> school poets 
          with terms such as “utopia,” as well as the banners and components of 
          60’s political movements. In the essay “Barbarism,” Hejinian states, 
          “The language movement originated as an utopian undertaking”(321). Also, 
          in that same essay, Hejinian articulates an outline of <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> 
          school’s basic tenets, one of which is that “racism, sexism, and classism 
          are repulsive”(323). On the basis of the commitment explicit in these 
          statements, I do feel somewhat justified bringing up the questions of 
          feminism and gender, at least in the spirit of inquiry. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
          the same time, <i>The Language of Inquiry</i> made me reflect upon what 
          may be my essentialist understanding of women’s writing. What was I 
          expecting from this text that I didn’t find? Do I assume that innovative 
          writing by women will or has to deal with feminism, gender, and power? 
          Perhaps it is better not to use feminism and gender as large and dull 
          critical knives when approaching Hejinian’s work, but to think about 
          it within particular ideas and practices. Her writing about knowledge 
          might be one particularly rich place to see how her ideas of gender 
          and feminism are played out. What do you think? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          One place I thought she did address gender and feminism very interestingly 
          is when she talks about the distinction between “identity” and “entity.” 
          In the essay “Common Sense,” when defining the distinction between identity 
          and entity, Hejinian writes, </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          dichotomy entails a conflict between identity (one’s selfsameness, the 
          consistency of what is perceived of one now with what is remembered 
          of one from the past and expected of one in the future – that is, the 
          way one is seen as a basis for being recognizable—and, perhaps, judged) 
          and entity (a lively, enduring, past and futureless present, creative 
          force of mind—neither woman nor slave, unclaimable and free).(368)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hejinian 
          talks about Gertrude Stein’s ability to speak from a position of entity 
          because entity was somehow located for her in the household and she 
          sees that as a historically feminine sphere. Another place that I saw 
          her addressing gender was in the unique motion of her form. It is a 
          movement that I find to be almost identical to the political one of 
          20<sup>th</sup> century feminist writers. Just as Susan Howe went back 
          and empowered Emily Dickinson’s words by letting them reverberate and 
          multiply in meaning, free of obscurity in twentieth century air, so 
          does Hejinian revisit her smaller earlier breaths—“A pause, a rose, 
          something on paper”—by attaching them to the breath-confidence and multiplicity 
          of meaning that comes from time. In <i>My Life, </i>one line gives birth 
          to a dream-like and self-reflexive meditation. Her speech is no longer 
          small. She has become part of her own tradition. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          My sense from that piece is that there is a freedom from the restraining 
          definitions of gender in the domestic sphere. Perhaps we should go there; 
          it is an interesting understanding of Stein, and one that might contribute 
          to recent work such as Janet Lyon’s work on the salon in modernism. 
          On page 367, Hejinian writes:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But for 
          Gertrude Stein, it was in the household sphere, in the domicile, that 
          freedom was possible, not so much because the domestic was a feminine 
          domain (the household being historically the only realm in which women 
          could engage in seeing rather than being seen), but because (and here 
          Stein turns the Greek topology inside out) it was a world, as she puts 
          it, not of human nature but of the human mind. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Right. She isn’t saying the domestic sphere is distinctly feminine, 
          but it is still a space for women to be feminine whether Stein chose 
          to claim it as that or not. Her mind could be a human mind in a household 
          sphere; if she moved outside of her particular living situation, she 
          would be viewed as a woman, not as a thinker, someone incredibly capable 
          of talking about masterpieces and genius. In her household she did not 
          have to engage with a narrative she didn’t create, which is part of 
          Hejinian’s idea of happiness, “atelic goal-free, aimless” and is a happiness 
          that is opposed to the plots and conditions of unhappiness.(371) I think 
          you can definitely see these ideas in terms of a feminist practice. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          You can, and it is vital for writers to claim that sort of freedom, 
          but given that Stein was not only talking about genius and masterpieces, 
          but wanted her work to be recognized within those worldly categories, 
          the domestic sphere cannot (and did not) remain the world in which women 
          have the freedom to claim the will of their minds. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Elsewhere in <i>The Language of Inquiry,</i> Hejinian implies that her 
          problem with equating writing that is fragmented, illogical, and without 
          closure as “feminine” is that it</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">suggests 
          some external realm where desire exists independently of language. To 
          Hejinian, Hélène Cixous’s notion of the “feminine textual body” is too 
          limited, because, as she writes: “The desire that is stirred by language 
          is located most interestingly within language itself”(54-56).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I think the way she expands the idea of desire away from the confines 
          of sexuality and the sexualized body is really interesting.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          So maybe the mind’s inquiry into language results in a genderless text. 
          For that to be true, there needs to be a social context in which a woman 
          can be respected as a thinker. I think the household was that sort of 
          context for Stein, and this is what I think Hejinian has been finding 
          in her community. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          How do you think Hejinian finds that perception—that she is a mind first 
          and foremost—in the community?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Well, certainly she feels that the company of writers with whom she 
          is acquainted always respect and support her ideas. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I think it is important to have “entity” as an ideal, even a utopian 
          ideal. At the same time, “Common Sense,” as well as the other essays 
          on Stein, don’t acknowledge how much Stein struggled to have that intellectual 
          space as her own. Often in very comical ways, Stein writes about how 
          her brother Leo continually dismissed her work. So one aspect of Stein’s 
          history is an act of freeing herself from perniciously gendered influences 
          before her mind could possess its own freedom. That doesn’t mean that 
          Leo or patriarchy or anyone else could limit her ability to think freely 
          as a mind, but it took some actual circumstances to make that freedom 
          of mind possible. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          I want to talk about her definition of identity: it is the social relationship; 
          it is the “I am I because my little dog knows me.” So, can you engage 
          in some kind of social environment and still lose identity? And is that 
          the only way to gain entity and get rid of gender, or be viewed as a 
          mind? Your identity, as Hejinian describes it, is the correspondence 
          between your past, present, and future. All these aspects of you that 
          people recognize as you because they have seen them before, but also 
          because they are mimicked and reinforced in society, in the social sphere.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          So, are you asking how much entity is dependent upon identity? Or vice 
          versa? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Kristin suggested that the entity Stein found in her household sphere, 
          Hejinian found in the community of <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> poets. So 
          how can a woman writer such as Stein or Hejinian be in a social space 
          and still lose identity, therefore gaining access to entity? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          It is not about losing identity, but about resisting the idea that identity 
          is the only thing that defines you as a writer or a person in the social 
          sphere. Also, haven’t we established that when we talk about entity, 
          we are talking about an ideal realm, at least in terms of gender?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Aren’t you implicitly speaking narratively about Hejinian’s past?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Probably. I see the whole book as a story-through-philosophy about how 
          this woman came into her own as a writer, intellectual, and collaborator. 
          In the recounting of how Hejinian arrived at this life of the mind, 
          I thought of other women writers who have arrived there as well. There’s 
          Anne Waldman who embodies IOVIS, the male energy source of Jove, who 
          gives her the freedom to engage with a literary lineage that extends 
          from Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams to Charles Olson. Interestingly, 
          it is a transformation of and negotiation with the feminine, and a rejection 
          of gender defined by sexuality that links the work of these two women. 
          Of course their poetics are quite different, but I actually think Waldman 
          and Hejinian deal with gender and the mind in similar ways. Both these 
          women are models for me. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          What I am saying is that when Hejinian talks about identity, she talks 
          about it as a correspondence between all the steps of your life, and 
          the million ways you can make those correspondences. If the social sphere 
          is so much about identity, and entity and identity are opposed, how 
          can you exist even more as an entity? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin: 
          </b>Entity and identity are not opposed; they are in conflict. It is 
          not that she doesn’t believe that identity is in part determined by 
          the social sphere, but rather that she perceives that the social sphere 
          as contingent upon power structures and structures of language. The 
          part of the book that cleared this up for me was when she was talking 
          about teaching. She writes about forcing her students away from the 
          personal and into the more social aspects of language (189).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          So you don’t think she believes that identity is rooted in the social 
          sphere? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          She might believe it, but as an artist, thinker, and teacher that isn’t 
          what interests her.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa: 
          </b>What about her statement: “Identity was what <i>The Autobiography 
          of Alice B. Toklas</i> was about; entity is the substance of <i>Stanzas 
          in Meditation</i>”(368). For Hejinian, writing about both Stein and 
          herself, identity is about dialogue and distance from the self, her 
          voice situated in someone else’s throat. She defines identity as “one’s 
          selfsameness, the consistency of what is perceived of one now with what 
          is remembered of one from the past and expected of one from the future—that 
          is, the way one is seen as a basis for being recognizable—and, perhaps, 
          judged”(368). I think that for Hejinian, identity is very much fixed 
          to the power structures and the structures of language built into the 
          social sphere. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          Because of her notions of language and consciousness, you can think 
          of gender as one point on a continuum, a point that you can perceive 
          and understand as influential, but can move out of or away from, at 
          least imaginatively. Hejinian’s use and understanding of entity seems 
          quite Kantian: an a priori mind, an idea of mind that has to exist before 
          you can conceive of something like identity. And perhaps responding 
          to the pressure of identity politics on poetry in recent years, she 
          wants to reassert the importance of that intellectual capacity.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Okay, but I find that tricky since I am interested in the questions 
          that surround the idea of the public intellectual. Where and when can 
          questions of intellect and move into questions of being a citizen in 
          the world, where issues of identity permeate the social sphere? And 
          yes, in language, I can disrupt ideas about the social sphere, but the

          I don’t think writers need to address social struggles at every moment, 
          or that anyone’s gendered experience is exactly like anyone else’s, 
          and it doesn’t necessarily need to be negative. But to write about your 
          experiences, and to write, like Gertrude Stein says, in your own handwriting, 
          you have to put some an awareness of that struggle into your writing. 
          The women’s writing I really like does that, but not didactically. </font></p>

          </b>And Hejinian’s writing does enact a gender that is in conflict, 
          that is, in flux; her writing does negotiate that space, and particularly 
          the way language and structure are played out on the page. This brings 
          us to what interests me about <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>: Hejinian’s 
          discussion of form and structure. It is when the poet discards notions 
          of “speaking for” the world and of participating in the creation of 
          truth-texts, that his/her language becomes open to being restructured. 
          And the way Hejinian talks about this is really useful. She writes, 
          “Form is not a fixture, but an activity”(47). I completely agree with 
          that statement, because after you’ve decided that language cannot represent 
          a unified identity, nor can it represent any notions of beauty or idealism, 
          or an individual’s singular experience of the world, then the poet becomes 
          a participant in the movement between self, world, and mind. My favorite 
          thing about this is that once the writer is open to tearing through 
          the house (putting the couch in the kitchen and the bed out on the porch), 
          there is no longer any such thing as writer’s block. No longer is the 
          writer worried about a unified source of inspiration; you’re just worried 
          about finding forms in all the material that you’ve generated. What 
          I respect most about Hejinian’s work is that her poetry uses language 
          in such a way that it is <i>in and of itself</i> the form. Ok, you gals 
          now can help me clarify these ideas. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          In contrast to the dismantling of imagistic poetry, or, more precisely, 
          the immediacy of perceptual exchange implied in imagistic poetry, I 
          think Hejinian’s texts do invite readers to bring images that her texts 
          suggest, but do not refer to explicitly, to their readings. And in that 
          way, there is a kind of openness that involves the reader, openness 
          quite different than many modernist texts. How do you connect these 
          ideas to your thoughts (and Hejinian’s thoughts) about form? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          What I think is interesting about her discussion of form is exactly 
          that kind of involvement with the mind of the reader. In terms of my 
          own poetics, I think there is a negotiation that needs to be made between 
          ideas of structure and ideas of content. When a writer removes poetry 
          from the purpose of creating a unified truth, then you are restructuring 
          language at some level, and that moment, as a writer, form and structure 
          are crucial. And the way Hejinian talks about this is really amazing. 
          Her work deploys and theorizes about language in such a way that it 
          cannot be easily appropriated or consumed, but still partially relies 
          on the perceptions of the reader.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I think Hejinian does think that language and forms do become fixed 
          and therefore easily disseminated and exchanged, but the writer can 
          always be involved in the activity of destabilization. </font></p>

          So, I am curious Kristin, what kind of forms are you are working in 
          now?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Right now, I am on a quest for forms. I collect newspaper articles and 
          fragments of text from official documents, and am always looking for 
          new ways to make the language of those sources intersect with poetic 
          forms. I’ve found that there are ideas and exercises in both investigative 
          poetics and inquiry-based poetics that are helpful to me in this process. 
          Speaking historically, you have investigative poetics that is represented 
          by Charles Olson, Ed Sanders, and Ed Dorn, and Anne Waldman. And then 
          you have the poetics of inquiry, and <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>, 
          which represents part of the <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> school poetics. 
          Actually, Kim and I were talking yesterday and we came up with a good 
          distinction between investigative poetics and the poetics of inquiry. 
          Could you repeat that?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          Well, I would think investigative poetics seeks to find its discovery 
          in the object and in the objective, and inquiry is far more speculative; 
          I think of investigation in terms of the detective and inquiry in terms 
          of the philosopher. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          That’s great. I am interested in the hybrid of those two forms. Collage 
          might be an example of this, but I am not really interested in collaging 
          language from different sources and then claiming them as my own. I 
          like revealing the sources because doing so dismantles the idea that 
          there is a transparent, ideal poem. The text becomes a collection of 
          written material that you can see into, and perhaps use for information. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          So do you see form as some sort of container that can hold material? 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          That is the question. Is the form a container for the text? No. And 
          this is where I get a lot from Hejinian and her ideas about form as 
          an activity. She takes the material and articulates it, but “without 
          depriving it of its capacious vitality”(47). So form makes the material 
          vibrant.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Which forms do you think make materials vibrant? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;text-autospace:none'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          I think you can find vibrancy in a variety of poetic forms. I steal 
          forms from other poets. I am really talking about shape on the page. 
          I made a “webpoem” after reading <i>The Language of Inquiry</i> and 
          thinking about our discussions. It’s called “Emergency Language Procedures”; 
          it is based on an emergency card taken from an airplane (<a
href="http://users.erols.com/prev/Upload/planeintro.html">http://users.erols.com/prev/Upload/planeintro.html</a>). 
          That’s where Hejinian’s example is so helpful: form is a continual dynamic 
          and allows the writer to investigate the way that language can find 
          form, and take shape. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Do you see form and content matching? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          I like to think that everything matches up, but I don’t know how to 
          identify it anymore. There is so much content generated by America—most 
          of it useless—and so much form—most of it “designed.” So I guess given 
          the time we are living in, no, I don’t think there is a match. I guess 
          that is one of the <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> school’s important contributions: 
          they dismantled the idea that form is to content as wine is to the glass. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          I think you are right; the <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> poets don’t believe 
          there is a total match. Hejinian writes, “When failing to attempt to 
          match the world, you discover structure, the distinction, integrity 
          and separateness of things”(56).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          I find it is interesting that you have taken T.S. Eliot’s idea that 
          “Immature poets borrow; mature poets steal,” but you have also rejected 
          Eliot’s and Pound’s attention to the enactment of content within form.

        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:  
          </b>In her preface to the 1998 edition of Gertrude Stein’s <i>Three 
          Lives</i>, Hejinian writes that author had, in the conception of this 
          work, “discovered something fundamental about the way time exists at 
          the interior of a human life; it is within living that time has its 
          sources”(277). Hejinian’s own work can be viewed through the dazzling 
          prism of this discovery. From her early piece <i>Writing Is an Aid to 
          Memory,</i> to her scholarship on Stein, Hejinian’s deep interest and 
          work with time—envisioned both as concept and material—has been a pervasive 
          theme.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
          writes, “one longs to diminish the inevitable loss of oneself and one’s 
          experience that time and morality bring about”(73). Instead of burying 
          this loss or diminishing this longing, by creating out of it a fixed 
          dichotomy (for instance between life and death or presence and absence), 
          Hejinian answers it, calls to it. Out of the fear, the gaps, and the 
          odd startling endpoints inherent in the construction of time, Hejinian 
          constructs many fluid dichotomies and then proceeds to twine them, structurally 
          and conceptually, around the other elements at play in her work. She 
          does this not as an attempt to capture time, but as a way to coexist 
          with it within its own fluidity—as a way to be as polymorphic as it 
          is, as language is.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the act of writing she seeks to reposition the center of time, to subvert 
          its locus of stability and power. She wants to move, rather than be 
          moved, and the lines that she wants to move are the perimeters of the 
          human mind itself, bordered and muffled by a present that “seems always 
          to be in the way”(357). Within this present, this source of identity 
          and overwhelming power “lie events we might wish to recover or redo 
          as between us and the future, in which our desires might be satisfied, 
          our ambitions fulfilled or our visions realized, the present, though 
          vexatiously elusive and seemingly momentary and minute, remains inescapably 
          in place”(357-358). Hejinian is able to displace this landscape of constraints 
          with her own site of swollen possibility. We see this process at work 
          most specifically in her essay entitled “Language and Paradise.” Here, 
          as in <i>My Life</i>, she revisits previously conceived poetic lines 
          by expanding them and critiquing them, even as she lets them lie whole. 
          Although she had earlier drawn her lips and stopped her phrase, she 
          is able, through writing, to encapsulate a more fluid sense of time; 
          to elongate that finished breath, to sweep in the gaps that had been 
          left out and to re-utter more evenly now her earlier glimpses of the 
          present-future.  </font></p>
        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          hesitant harnessing of time also allows Hejinian the chance to overstep 
          her own constructed borders. Just as time “challenges the span of the 
          self “(67), time frees the self, allowing the poet (as well as the reader 
          drawn into the writing process), an entrance into a sort of circular 
          dissociation. Hejinian is both reader and writer. She is both present 
          and lost, even to what she is and once was. For her, “what stays in 
          the gaps remains crucial and informative. Part of the reading occurs 
          as the recovery of that information (looking behind) and the discovery 
          of newly structured ideas (stepping forward)”(46). </font></p>
        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the fluidity of movement, in the lying in time, there exists no endpoint, 
          no beginning and no stable fixed well of a voice.  Nothing, not even 
          a life, is closed.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoPlainText style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          read this fluidity most beautifully perhaps in <i>My Life. </i>For instance, 
          the opening line “A pause, a rose, something on paper” absorbs and is 
          imprinted upon the continual revisitations of that line; it becomes 
          drawn out in “A moment yellow.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          What you’ve so beautifully articulated connects to what I have been 
          thinking about in terms of Hejinian and Stein. Stein defines genius 
          as talking and listening simultaneously. In her lecture “Portraits and 
          Repetition,” she states, “One may really indeed say that that is the 
          essence of genius, of being most intensely alive, that is being the 
          one who is at the same time talking and listening”(290). So, there is 
          conscious attention in Hejinian’s work, (and I don’t think I can talk 
          about this as well as you have in terms of time, but I can talk about 
          it in terms of meaning) of putting a word down, marking the page, and 
          being very conscious of the way that word nails down and limits possibilities, 
          but then also acknowledging the infinite possibility within that choice 
          at the same time. She “talks” from the word and “listens” to its possible 
          reverberations as well.  So, time hinges on the word in a way. Once 
          you put the word on the page, imaginative time expands from that word.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          I think this is also bound up with her ideas about entity. The present 
          is considered both the essence and the shape of entity. Here creativity 
          is boundless and unfettered. For Hejinian this quality of “presentness” 
          is synonymous with what she calls the “creative force of mind,” a force 
          that is “neither woman nor slave, unclaimable and free”(369). To live 
          in the present is to place oneself on a powerful springboard. In the 
          present, one is able to enact the intellectual process that you are 
          talking about. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          Perhaps living in the writer’s present also allows one to acknowledge 
          and subvert the strictures of gender. So, not that these ideas need 
          to map neatly on to each other, but would you say talking belongs to 
          identity and listening belongs to entity? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          That gets us to a defining moment in <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> poetry when 
          common speech and language are separated—Bob Grenier’s proclamation, 
          “I HATE SPEECH.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          Is that idea at work in <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>? I think the 
          work goes back and forth between composed, written writing and the spontaneity 
          of speech. <i>Happily </i>is partially a dialogue, or gestures toward 
          dialogue, and loves the contingency of speech. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Back to your question. I think she addresses this when she talks about 
          Stein’s distinction between her famous aphorism “I am I because my little 
          dog knows me” and her later expansion of that sentence “I am I because 
          my little dog knows me but, creatively speaking the little dog knowing 
          that you are you and your recognizing that he knows, that is what destroys 
          creation”( 369). So from her position of entity, Stein is critiquing 
          identity and also the dialogues—even the abstracted ones—that are inseparable 
          from it. Located within her boundless, unmapped present, she is listening 
          to herself and also to the distinct separate echoes of other people. 
          I think that, to her, listening and entity are the spaces of knowledge 
          that endow one with the capacity to critique and to see the self in 
          the world.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          Do you want to say something about your investigation into the spiritual 
          in Hejinian’s work?  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          Sure. If there is a sense of the spiritual in Hejinian’s work, it is 
          a muffled sense, a quiet composition of shadows bound tightly to the 
          earth. Nearly definable in shape and stance precisely because they mirror 
          the shapes and stances embedded in the structures of language, these 
          shadows stand together as a landscape: enterable, obtainable, and desolate. 
          The poet enters through the portal or film (she talks about language 
          as a film) of landscape to paradise, but only to return, and to have 
          the desire to return to the site of its own impulse or making. The poet 
          comes back to the impulse that made and shaped paradise. This is a really 
          great part of that essay: “...the poet seeks to go beyond the poem, 
          to cross the very limit of language, and thus reach an unmediated, beatific 
          experience of Paradise—one which, however, were it indeed to be such 
          an unmediated experience would be unspeakable; Paradise can only be 
          experienced in silence”(66). There is so much mirroring in her work—a 
          sense of doubleness. That is why I think she is really interesting. 
          Her twining of dichotomies is so interesting and so complex.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kristin:</b> 
          What exists even more fundamentally is a very simple equation. She is 
          trying to trace assumed forms and is attempting to show how those forms 
          can be disrupted through language. That is why she is interested in 
          confession, because it is a strange form. The confessor is trying to 
          exist out of time and is therefore an interesting disruption of narrative.  
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Melissa:</b> 
          I think that is definitely true. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Kimberly:</b> 
          But isn’t part of what Melissa is trying to get at in Hejinian’s work 
          is this idea that the writing develops its own structure of time, and 
          the writer becomes suspended in that structure? Accountability becomes 
          involved in that suspension because within that time the writer re-sees 
          or revisits the choices she made in language. So Stein’s idea that there 
          is no such thing as repetition, there is only insistence, becomes crucial.

          Hejinian is never addressing a particular reader or listener; she imagines 
          that the reader responds to the text as she responds to her own writing, 
          which isn't a model of poetic “communication,” and very important in 
          the field of contemporary poetry for that reason. </font></p>
