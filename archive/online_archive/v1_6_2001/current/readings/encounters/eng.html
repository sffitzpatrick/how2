          as an experience of language, as Bachmann says, and language as an experience 
          of fascism.  Everything begins with this relation in her work.  A new 
          form of interruption emerges around the status of such an experience to 
          call <i>all language</i> into question—not only communicative and scientific 
          language, but also that of the literary and the poetic.  Not only the 
          voices of history, but also the history of the voice itself.  But does 
          she really say it?  To call this interruption by the name of writing is 
          to reveal only part of the complexity of the question as Bachmann understands 
          it.  For prior to writing, and prior to the speech of which it is an image, 
          there is first of all that relation to language to which the writer is 
          prisoner—that “altogether other relation [<i>das ganz andere Verhältnis</i>]”(<i>Wir 
          müssen</i>, 84) “of the beggar,” as Levinas describes it speaking of Celan, 
          in “the house of being”(“Paul Celan,” 40).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          But Bachmann does not beg, and the juxtaposition (not to mention the metaphor), 
          though crucial, risks conflating the differences between her and Celan 
          in their respective reactions to Heidegger.  We note first of all that 
          the poverty to which Celan exposes himself in the confrontation with Heidegger’s 
          thought—leaving aside for a larger investigation his poem, “Todtnauberg,” 
          which chronicles his meeting with Heidegger in 1966<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
          [2] </span></a>—is constituted most clearly in his Bremen and Darmstadt 
          addresses of 1958 and 1960, in which the poet, arriving via certain “detours” 
          [<i>Umwege</i>] from a time and place “now fallen outside history,”<a
  href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> begins his address 
          by invoking the philosopher’s treatment of poetry, thought, and remembrance 
          in Hölderlin’s “Mnemosyme.”  It is a treatment that Celan will directly 
          link to the persistence of language and the “realities” left present to 
          poetry in the moments following the losses of the Second World War.  In 
          a passage that requires continuous citation (and translation), he writes:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Only one 
            thing remained close and reachable amid all losses: language.</font><br>
          <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
            Yes, language.  In spite of everything it remained unlost [<i>unverloren</i>].  
            But it had to go through its own lack of answers [<i>Antwortlosigkeit</i>], 
            through terrifying silence [<i>furchtbares Verstummen</i>], through 
            the thousand darknesses of murderous speech.  It went through and gave 
            no words for what happened; but it went through this event [<i>Geschehen</i>].  
            It went through and could resurface, “enriched” by it all.</font><br>
          <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
            In this language, I tried, during those years and the years after, to 
            write poems: in order to speak, to orient myself, to find out where 
            I was, where I was being taken [<i>wohin es mit mir wollte</i>], to 
            sketch for myself a reality [<i>Wirklichkeit</i>].</font><br>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
          inflected through the “terrifying silence” of this persistence—and this 
          is what makes Celan’s remarks so noteworthy—is Heidegger’s own speech, 
          not only the language of Being and his emphasis on the relation of <i>Denken</i> 
          to <i>Dichten</i> in the ’50s, but the silence for which he has since 
          become infamous regarding his political engagements of the ’30s.  Here 
          Celan both anticipates and exceeds much of even the most recent responses 
          to the questions left open by the “Heidegger Affair” in Europe and the 
          United States by insistently placing the losses belonging to the <i>Nachkriegszeit</i> 
          side by side with the language of “event” (<i>Ereignis</i>) and way (<i>Bewegung</i> 
          [movement], <i>Umwege</i> [detours], and <i>Unterwegssein</i> [being on 
          the way]) occupying Heidegger’s later work.  In response to both Heidegger’s 
          failure to address his actions during the Nazi period and the failure 
          of his meditations on philosophy, language, and poetry to speak to the 
          silences in the period that followed, Celan <i>assumes</i> Heidegger’s 
          speech, not (or not simply) to hold it accountable for its failures, but 
          to <i>accomplish</i> <i>it</i>—to bring it to confront the very historicity 
          of its existence and <i>finitude</i> at the heart of Heidegger’s concern 
          and text, to continue, then, to provoke what the events of the war had 
          shown Heidegger himself was unable to fully realize, namely: “<i>what 
          must be said</i>” (Fynsk, 135); the “Saying” of language; “<i>die Sprache 
          spricht</i>.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
          is the nature of such an accomplishment?  And what was at stake for Bachmann 
          when, in May 1973 just four months before her death, she chose to (continue 
          to) ignore it?  In a highly significant moment in which she responds to 
          a question about her dissertation on Heidegger (1949) and what the interviewer, 
          Karol Sauerland, describes as her “Anti-Heideggerianism,” Bachmann states: 
          </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of course, 
            I did not overthrow Heidegger.  But at the time I was absolutely convinced 
            that he would not survive this dissertation.  He knows of it, incidentally, 
            he is one of the few people who does.  And without knowing about it 
            before hand, he had an odd request for his publisher for a poem from 
            Paul Celan and one from me for the volume commemorating his seventieth 
            birthday.  And we both said no.  Because I knew Heidegger’s Rectoral 
            Address [<i>The Self-Assertion of the German University</i> (1933)], 
            and even if there weren’t this address, there would always be something 
            else, there would always be a temptation [or “seduction” (<i>Verführung</i>)]<i> 
            </i>to return to German irrationalist thought [<i>Irrationaldenken</i>]. 
            (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 137)  </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
          these statements should still remain consistent in their findings—even 
          given their determinedly political character—with the conclusions Bachmann 
          draws in her dissertation about Heidegger’s early work is less surprising 
          than the reversals that they enact.  For even if we were to agree with 
          her characterization of Heidegger’s early work—as an “attempt” of a “‘second 
          science’ [‘<i>zweiten Wissenschaft</i>’]” to determine the “inexpressible” 
          and the “immediacy of the emotional realm of human beings” that instead 
          signifies the “dangerous half-rationalization of a sphere that can be 
          touched upon with one word from Wittgenstein: ‘Whereof one cannot speak, 
          thereof one must remain silent’” (<i>Die kritische Aufnahme</i>, 114-15)—there 
          is still nothing in her remarks to connect this “dangerous half-rationalization” 
          with the “political” directions of the <i>Rektorat</i>.  Conversely, neither 
          is there anything in Bachmann’s statements to connect the ambitions Heidegger 
          outlined for the German university in the resistance to <i>Technik</i> 
          to either the drive to express the inexpressible or to the German “irrationalist 
          thought” that she maintains is the project of Heidegger’s early work.  
          Given this strange passage between the “<i>wissenschafliche</i>”<i> </i>writing 
          of Bachmann’s dissertation and the personal remarks of the interview, 
          we are thus left with at least two alternatives:</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          1.  Either the political “error” is a philosophical one, which in keeping 
          with both the Neo-Kantian and Wittgensteinian impulses of the dissertation 
          would not only involve the faculty of judgment and its application in 
          the practical sphere, but also and prior to this the faculty of reason 
          and its failure to “stop” at the limits of what can be known or said.  
          This would certainly go some way to account for the “dangerous half-rationalization” 
          onto which Bachmann alleges Heidegger’s attention to “the nothing” (<i>das 
          Nichts</i>) of existence opens.  But, without turning our concerns to 
          the precisely <i>ethical</i> nature of the “tendency . . . <i>to go beyond</i> 
          the world,” as Wittgenstein claims in his “Lecture on Ethics” (1929)—as 
          it seems Bachmann herself was unable or unwilling to do—even the Neo-Kantian 
          contention would only take us so far because the offense simply remains 
          an epistemological one, no different from the offenses Kant outlined in 
          the first critique and which he named the antinomies of pure reason.  
          Such an affront to reason, instead of fortifying Bachmann’s effort to 
          establish a strong link between Heidegger’s philosophical praxis and his 
          political engagements with National Socialism—without, it should be noted, 
          documenting in any detail anywhere where or how this precise slippage 
          occurs in Heidegger’s actual text—simply underscores a strange prejudice 
          (shared in various ways by various members of the Vienna Circle of Logical 
          Positivists) towards that Platonic correspondence between knowledge and 
          action.  What is the risk of such a prejudice?  Exactly that of relativizing 
          the question of the political within Heidegger’s thought as just another 
          metaphysical error—or an error of metaphysics.  As a result, Bachmann 
          will miss several moments between Heidegger’s text [particularly, “What 
          is Metaphysics” (1929) and <i>Introduction to Metaphysics </i>(1935)] 
          and Wittgenstein’s early preoccupation with what he called in the <i>Tractatus</i> 
          the ethical and the mystical.  In a footnote to her essay, “Ludwig Wittgenstein—Zu 
          einem Kapitel der jüngsten Philosophiegeschichte” (“Ludwig Wittgenstein—Toward 
          a Chapter in the Most Recent History of Philosophy”), Bachmann dismisses 
          a connection that Ewald Wasmuth makes between the mystical in the <i>Tractatus</i> 
          (“6.44  It is not <i>how </i>things are in the world that is mystical, 
          but <i>that </i>it exists.”) and “Heidegger’s question: ‘Why are there 
          beings and not nothing?’” stating: “But it would be impossible for Wittgenstein 
          to pose such a question since he denied everything Heidegger presumed: 
          that within thinking, Being arrives in language [<i>daß im Denken das 
          Sein zur Sprache komme</i>]” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 373).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          2.  Or the philosophical error is political, in which case Bachmann never 
          quite states it.  Nor does she furnish any evidence for such a reversal.  
          This possibility, of course, is not incompatible with the first alternative 
          just outlined, but it does draw our attention to the question of <i>Bachmann’s</i> 
          <i>silence</i> in relation to both Heidegger’s refusal to speak to the 
          events of the Second World War <i>and </i>the “terrifying silence” to 
          which Celan attempts to expose Heidegger’s speech.  Thus the “dangerous 
          half-rationalization” that Bachmann diagnoses as everywhere present in 
          Heidegger’s work becomes the half-rationalization of a danger that language 
          itself makes possible and is everywhere present in everything expressible 
          (including the “inexpressible”).  This is why we must speak of a “Verführung”—a 
          temptation, a seduction—at the heart of Heidegger’s thought, if not at 
          the heart of <i>all</i> speech and <i>all</i> thought as such.  If this 
          were not the case, then Bachmann’s perhaps most famous phrase concerning 
          the fascism that begins in the relationships between human beings would 
          have no sense.  Isn’t this the danger of Heidegger’s speech for Bachmann, 
          that it reveals an exposure of the “entirety of thought” to a temptation 
          or seduction by an “originary fascism” that threatens all speech and all 
          relation, including her own?  And isn’t this what is at stake in the “terrifying 
          silence” to which Celan responds, the possibility precisely of no longer 
          being able to respond to language’s experience of its own lack of answers 
          in a time “after Heidegger?”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span> 
          [4] </span></a></font></p>
        <p align=right style='text-align:right;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>In 
          the Penal Colony</i></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus 
          if silence pervades Bachmann’s work, it is certainly not limited to the 
          (in)expressible or the knowable but belongs rather to the spaces between 
          writing and speech, to the writing of knowledge (as <i>scientia</i>) and 
          the speech of the (in)expressible.  In resisting the suggestion of a determining 
          influence of Wittgenstein in her work, Bachmann holds that “the difference 
          between philosophy and writing is too great” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 136) 
          to constitute a direct “linguistic” correspondence.  Instead, Bachmann 
          repeats the final proposition of the <i>Tractatus</i>—“Whereof one cannot 
          speak, thereof one must remain silent”—in order to open a site at the 
          near side of the limit of the expressible.  There is no reason to avoid 
          a reading of this sort of resistance in Bachmann’s thought (which, incidentally, 
          appears continuously in her interviews); for between the writing of philosophy 
          and the writing of <i>writing</i>, there is the taking-place for Bachmann 
          of language itself, the Wittgensteinian difference between showing and 
          saying <i>as a saying</i>—a voice—of what language cannot (not) say—namely, 
          its <i>fact</i>: “only one endeavor,” she says, “is meaningful in writing: 
          that which attends to language” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 11).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> 
          [5] </span></a>  “Silence then,” writes Giorgio Agamben, “is not simply 
          a suspension of discourse, but silence of the word itself, the becoming 
          visible of the word: the idea of language” (<i>Idea of Prose</i>, 113).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          Yet the relation of silence to the facts of language in itself would not 
          lead us back to the question of fascism as we understand it here.  Instead, 
          the silence that opens onto the fact of language makes felt the question 
          of (the violence of) relation as such. This is why when we recall the 
          “first little saying-nothing sentences [<i>die ersten kleinen nichtssagenden 
          Saetze</i>]” in <i>Malina</i> we are drawn also, as Agamben is, to the 
          “terrible secret” of the punishment of language and the guilt that precedes 
          any appearance of the word to which these saying-nothing sentences are 
          intimately connected.  In the section immediately following the one cited 
          above, Agamben writes (“in memoriam Ingeborg Bachmann”):</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A singular 
            light is thrown on Kafka’s tale of the Penal Colony when one realizes 
            that the machine of torture invented by the previous commandant of the 
            colony is in fact language.  But by the same stroke it becomes even 
            more complex.  In the tale the machine is primarily an instrument of 
            justice and punishment.  This means that, on earth and for men, language 
            is also such an instrument.  The secret of the penal colony is the same 
            as that which a character in a contemporary novel reveals in these words: 
            “I’ll let you in on a terrible secret: language is the punishment.  
            All things must enter it and perish there according to their guilt and 
            the scale of their guilt.” (<i>Idea of Prose</i>, 115, translation modified 
            / Bachmann, <i>Werke </i>III, 97)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
          be sure, Bachmann never explicates the nature of this guilt, or the nature 
          of the crime, for the language in which she would do so would have been 
          already conditioned by it, just as the child who learns to say “I” does 
          so by first admitting having “done something”: “I did it, I, I, I!” (<i>Werke</i>, 
          218-219).  If the intimacy of the relation between the I, Ivan, and Malina 
          is itself conditioned by this “terrible secret” of language, as perhaps 
          all relations are, then instead of being able to decide finally on the 
          primacy of the various versions and slopes of the relation of fascism 
          to language, there arises a desire in Bachmann’s work to acknowledge fascism’s 
          sheer excess.  Not only the manner in which it exceeds the decidability 
          between the violences and genocides within history [“Unter Mödern und 
          Irren” (“Among Murderers and Madmen”), “Jugend in einer österreischisen 
          Stadt” (“Youth in an Austrian Town”)] and the “<i>gynocides</i>” within 
          the relationships between men and women (<i>Malina</i>, <i>Der Fall Franza</i>),<a href="#_edn6"
  name="_ednref6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a> but also its ability to transgress 
          the events themselves and infiltrate—or as Bachmann says, infect—the very 
          voice narrating their histories.  <i>Das dreissigste Jahr</i> (<i>The 
          Thirtieth Year</i>): “I, this package composed of reflections and a well

          Storyteller</i></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If 
          the accounts that stage Bachmann’s work within the Austrian struggle with 
          history (<i>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</i>) or within the traumatic experience 
          of the history of the Second World War have any purchase, it is less for 
          their skill at employing a certain form of banal historicism and at applying 
          a certain faith in the unity of an experiencing, historical subject, than 
          for the questions that they raise concerning the paradoxical status of 
          the category of experience “today.”  We recall the I in <i>Malina</i> 
          as s/he begins the narrative by admitting that it is no longer possible 
          for her/him to say “today,” only to frame the event of the disruption 
          of the voice whose breath becomes irregular—arrhythmic—whenever it attempts 
          to break free from the banality of the tasks and happenings of the “day” 
          (<i>Werke</i>, III, 12-13).  Yet we also know that the events themselves 
          can only take place “today”; there is only “today” “after the War” [“<i>nach 
          dem Krieg</i>” (<i>Werke</i>, II, 159)].  Thus fallen outside of history, 
          “today is a word,” narrates the I, “that only those committing suicide 
          are able to use” (<i>Werke</i>, III, 13).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          Thus, in revisiting Bachmann’s Frankfurt lectures on poetics and her reflections 
          therein on the “‘I’ without guarantees” within the history of literature 
          (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 218), we cannot escape the impression that within those 
          lectures she is laying the ground for the inclusion of her own work within 
          this same history.  No longer able to say “today,” no longer able to say 
          “we,”—“we, who are preoccupied with language, have learned what speechlessness 
          and muteness are—our, if you will, purest conditions!—and have returned 
          from that no-man’s land with language which we will perpetuate as long 
          as life is our own continuation” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 60)—Bachmann’s writing 
          becomes increasingly populated with figures resembling Hofmannsthal’s 
          Lord Chandos whose “capacity for the coherency of thinking and speaking 
          has left him” and who as a result can only experience the “disintegration” 
          of “abstract words...like moldy mushrooms in the mouth” (<i>Werke</i>, 
          IV, 189).  These figures, who act but no longer see, who live (<i>erleben</i>) 
          but no longer experience (<i>erfahren</i>), reveal an “I” that is inseparable 
          from a fundamental “experience of suffering” (<i>Leiderfahrung</i>), an 
          “experience (before experience),” as Christopher Fynsk says, of the “subject.”

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
          is meant by this, and what is the relation of this “limit-experience” 
          to literature and to writing?  Of course, we have already been exposed 
          to an answer, when Benjamin, writing of the disruption posed to storytelling 
          in the communication of experience, writes: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For never 
            has experience been contradicted more thoroughly than strategic experience 
            by tactical warfare, economic experience by inflation, bodily experience 
            by mechanical warfare, moral experience by those in power.  A generation 
            that had gone to school on a horse-drawn streetcar now stood under the 
            open sky in a countryside in which nothing remained unchanged but the 
            clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive 
            torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body. (“The Storyteller,” 
            84).</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, 
          everywhere in Bachmann, it is not so much that the events of the Second 
          World War mark an historical break as they mark a break in “history” itself, 
          a rupture in “time.”  Bachmann, quite aware of Benjamin’s distinction 
          between <i>Erlebnis </i>as “discontinuous, lived experience” and <i>Erfahrung 
          </i>as “integrated, meaningful experience,” pursues a memory similar to 
          Benjamin’s “denunciation of the aestheticization of violence and glorification 
          of the ‘fascist class warrior’” (Jay, “Walter Benjamin”) in her fragmentary 
          essay, “Auf das Opfer darf keiner sich berufen” (“The Victims Shall Not 
          Be Summoned”), where she contends: “It is not true that victims remind, 
          witness, or are testimony for anything.  That is the most terrible, thoughtless, 
          weakest poeticization...No land and no group, no idea should wake the 
          dead” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 335).  Like Benjamin, Bachmann is acutely aware 
          of what Foucault called the “fascism in us all” and terribly conscious 
          of the both the risk <i>and temptation</i> to reinscribe the violences 
          that we seek to resist.  The writer’s task, as Bachmann sees it, is to 
          confront this paradox of both memory and the “withering of experience 
          [<i>Erfahrungsschwund</i>]” by bringing—or tearing—one into the experiences 
          (“<i>Erfahrungen</i>”) that the writer creates and to withdraw one from 
          the “dangerous progress [<i>Entwicklung</i>]<i> </i>of this modern world” 
          (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 140).  It is for this reason that we can become aware 
          of “only the most powerful phrases of <i>today</i>: If we had the word, 
          if we had language, we would not need the weapons” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 
          185, emphasis added).</font></p>
        <p align=right style='text-align:right;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“<i>a 
          human voice</i>”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          is the nature of this experience “created” by the writer in a time without 
          language?  Everyday is “today”, “‘<i>Nach dem Krieg</i>’—<i>dies ist die 
          Zeitrechnung </i>[‘After the War’—this is the calculation of time]” (<i>Werke</i>, 
          II, 159), a memory “touched” by the dead—these all point to the fact that, 
          as Gilles Deleuze writes, “in Europe, the post-war period has greatly 
          increased the situations which we no longer know how to describe.  These 
          were ‘any spaces whatever,’ deserted but inhabited, disused warehouses, 
          waste ground, cities in the course of demolition or reconstruction.  And 
          in these any-spaces-whatever a new race of characters was stirring, kind 
          of mutant: they saw rather than acted, they were seers” (<i>Cinema 2</i>, 
          x).  But these in no way should be understood as conditions into which 
          the historical subject is placed, as if dropped from on high and experienced 
          in a simply affected functioning of sight and sound.  Instead, they are 
          the <i>affective</i> conditions of the “subject,” what has come to be 
          the “originary” interruptions preceding the ascension of human beings 
          to language and to experience as such—that make the subject, as it were, 
          <i>possible</i>.  If space allowed, it would be necessary to elucidate 
          just what is at stake in this “possibility”—known, provisionally, as the 
          human—for thought, for language, for the ethical and the political.  Such 
          an elucidation would certainly call for both a critique of what Bachmann 
          called “the absolute complicity of words and images” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 
          25) as well as the provocation of what she named “a human voice.”</font></p>

            (“Ansprache,” 127).  My translation of the phrase can only be imprecise.  
            What Celan indicates as a <i>Geschichtslosigkeit</i>—a “history-less-ness” 
            / a “loss of history”—is modified by the term “<i>anheimgefallen</i>,” 
            designating not only a falling-into, but a being-reduced-to, as well 
            as an inheritance.  As if this were not complicated enough, <i>anheimgefallen</i> 
            also contains the root, <i>heim</i>, the home or homely, which for Celan 
            is precisely what is in question in the <i>Nachkriegszeit </i>(after 
            the war) and “after Heidegger.”  For a much more sustained and rigorous
