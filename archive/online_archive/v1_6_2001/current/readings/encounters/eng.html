        as an experience of language, as Bachmann says, and language as an experience 
        of fascism.  Everything begins with this relation in her work.  A new 
        form of interruption emerges around the status of such an experience to 
        call <i>all language</i> into question—not only communicative and scientific 
        language, but also that of the literary and the poetic.  Not only the 
        voices of history, but also the history of the voice itself.  But does 
        she really say it?  To call this interruption by the name of writing is 
        to reveal only part of the complexity of the question as Bachmann understands 
        it.  For prior to writing, and prior to the speech of which it is an image, 
        there is first of all that relation to language to which the writer is 
        prisoner—that “altogether other relation [<i>das ganz andere Verhältnis</i>]”(<i>Wir 
        müssen</i>, 84) “of the beggar,” as Levinas describes it speaking of Celan, 
        in “the house of being”(“Paul Celan,” 40).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
        But Bachmann does not beg, and the juxtaposition (not to mention the metaphor), 
        though crucial, risks conflating the differences between her and Celan 
        in their respective reactions to Heidegger.  We note first of all that 
        the poverty to which Celan exposes himself in the confrontation with Heidegger’s 
        thought—leaving aside for a larger investigation his poem, “Todtnauberg,” 
        which chronicles his meeting with Heidegger in 1966<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
        [2] </span></a>—is constituted most clearly in his Bremen and Darmstadt 
        addresses of 1958 and 1960, in which the poet, arriving via certain “detours” 
        [<i>Umwege</i>] from a time and place “now fallen outside history,”<a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> begins his address 
        by invoking the philosopher’s treatment of poetry, thought, and remembrance 
        in Hölderlin’s “Mnemosyme.”  It is a treatment that Celan will directly 
        link to the persistence of language and the “realities” left present to 
        poetry in the moments following the losses of the Second World War.  In 
        a passage that requires continuous citation (and translation), he writes:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Only one 
          thing remained close and reachable amid all losses: language.</font><br>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          Yes, language.  In spite of everything it remained unlost [<i>unverloren</i>].  
          But it had to go through its own lack of answers [<i>Antwortlosigkeit</i>], 
          through terrifying silence [<i>furchtbares Verstummen</i>], through 
          the thousand darknesses of murderous speech.  It went through and gave 
          no words for what happened; but it went through this event [<i>Geschehen</i>].  
          It went through and could resurface, “enriched” by it all.</font><br>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          In this language, I tried, during those years and the years after, to 
          write poems: in order to speak, to orient myself, to find out where 
          I was, where I was being taken [<i>wohin es mit mir wollte</i>], to 
          sketch for myself a reality [<i>Wirklichkeit</i>].</font><br>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
          It meant, as you see, event, movement, being on the way, it was an attempt 
          to find direction. (“Ansprache,” 128)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
        inflected through the “terrifying silence” of this persistence—and this 
        is what makes Celan’s remarks so noteworthy—is Heidegger’s own speech, 
        not only the language of Being and his emphasis on the relation of <i>Denken</i> 
        to <i>Dichten</i> in the ’50s, but the silence for which he has since 
        become infamous regarding his political engagements of the ’30s.  Here 
        Celan both anticipates and exceeds much of even the most recent responses 
        to the questions left open by the “Heidegger Affair” in Europe and the 
        United States by insistently placing the losses belonging to the <i>Nachkriegszeit</i> 
        side by side with the language of “event” (<i>Ereignis</i>) and way (<i>Bewegung</i> 
        [movement], <i>Umwege</i> [detours], and <i>Unterwegssein</i> [being on 
        the way]) occupying Heidegger’s later work.  In response to both Heidegger’s 
        failure to address his actions during the Nazi period and the failure 
        of his meditations on philosophy, language, and poetry to speak to the 
        silences in the period that followed, Celan <i>assumes</i> Heidegger’s 
        speech, not (or not simply) to hold it accountable for its failures, but 
        to <i>accomplish</i> <i>it</i>—to bring it to confront the very historicity 
        of its existence and <i>finitude</i> at the heart of Heidegger’s concern 
        and text, to continue, then, to provoke what the events of the war had 
        shown Heidegger himself was unable to fully realize, namely: “<i>what 
        must be said</i>” (Fynsk, 135); the “Saying” of language; “<i>die Sprache 
        spricht</i>.”</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
        is the nature of such an accomplishment?  And what was at stake for Bachmann 
        when, in May 1973 just four months before her death, she chose to (continue 
        to) ignore it?  In a highly significant moment in which she responds to 
        a question about her dissertation on Heidegger (1949) and what the interviewer, 
        Karol Sauerland, describes as her “Anti-Heideggerianism,” Bachmann states: 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of course, 
          I did not overthrow Heidegger.  But at the time I was absolutely convinced 
          that he would not survive this dissertation.  He knows of it, incidentally, 
          he is one of the few people who does.  And without knowing about it 
          before hand, he had an odd request for his publisher for a poem from 
          Paul Celan and one from me for the volume commemorating his seventieth 
          birthday.  And we both said no.  Because I knew Heidegger’s Rectoral 
          Address [<i>The Self-Assertion of the German University</i> (1933)], 
          and even if there weren’t this address, there would always be something 
          else, there would always be a temptation [or “seduction” (<i>Verführung</i>)]<i> 
          </i>to return to German irrationalist thought [<i>Irrationaldenken</i>]. 
          (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 137)  </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
        these statements should still remain consistent in their findings—even 
        given their determinedly political character—with the conclusions Bachmann 
        draws in her dissertation about Heidegger’s early work is less surprising 
        than the reversals that they enact.  For even if we were to agree with 
        her characterization of Heidegger’s early work—as an “attempt” of a “‘second 
        science’ [‘<i>zweiten Wissenschaft</i>’]” to determine the “inexpressible” 
        and the “immediacy of the emotional realm of human beings” that instead 
        signifies the “dangerous half-rationalization of a sphere that can be 
        touched upon with one word from Wittgenstein: ‘Whereof one cannot speak, 
        thereof one must remain silent’” (<i>Die kritische Aufnahme</i>, 114-15)—there 
        is still nothing in her remarks to connect this “dangerous half-rationalization” 
        with the “political” directions of the <i>Rektorat</i>.  Conversely, neither 
        is there anything in Bachmann’s statements to connect the ambitions Heidegger 
        outlined for the German university in the resistance to <i>Technik</i> 
        to either the drive to express the inexpressible or to the German “irrationalist 
        thought” that she maintains is the project of Heidegger’s early work.  
        Given this strange passage between the “<i>wissenschafliche</i>”<i> </i>writing 
        of Bachmann’s dissertation and the personal remarks of the interview, 
        we are thus left with at least two alternatives:</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
        1.  Either the political “error” is a philosophical one, which in keeping 
        with both the Neo-Kantian and Wittgensteinian impulses of the dissertation 
        would not only involve the faculty of judgment and its application in 
        the practical sphere, but also and prior to this the faculty of reason 
        and its failure to “stop” at the limits of what can be known or said.  
        This would certainly go some way to account for the “dangerous half-rationalization” 
        onto which Bachmann alleges Heidegger’s attention to “the nothing” (<i>das 
        Nichts</i>) of existence opens.  But, without turning our concerns to 
        the precisely <i>ethical</i> nature of the “tendency . . . <i>to go beyond</i> 
        the world,” as Wittgenstein claims in his “Lecture on Ethics” (1929)—as 
        it seems Bachmann herself was unable or unwilling to do—even the Neo-Kantian 
        contention would only take us so far because the offense simply remains 
        an epistemological one, no different from the offenses Kant outlined in 
        the first critique and which he named the antinomies of pure reason.  
        Such an affront to reason, instead of fortifying Bachmann’s effort to 
        establish a strong link between Heidegger’s philosophical praxis and his 
        political engagements with National Socialism—without, it should be noted, 
        documenting in any detail anywhere where or how this precise slippage 
        occurs in Heidegger’s actual text—simply underscores a strange prejudice 
        (shared in various ways by various members of the Vienna Circle of Logical 
        Positivists) towards that Platonic correspondence between knowledge and 
        action.  What is the risk of such a prejudice?  Exactly that of relativizing 
        the question of the political within Heidegger’s thought as just another 
        metaphysical error—or an error of metaphysics.  As a result, Bachmann 
        will miss several moments between Heidegger’s text [particularly, “What 
        is Metaphysics” (1929) and <i>Introduction to Metaphysics </i>(1935)] 
        and Wittgenstein’s early preoccupation with what he called in the <i>Tractatus</i> 
        the ethical and the mystical.  In a footnote to her essay, “Ludwig Wittgenstein—Zu 
        einem Kapitel der jüngsten Philosophiegeschichte” (“Ludwig Wittgenstein—Toward 
        a Chapter in the Most Recent History of Philosophy”), Bachmann dismisses 
        a connection that Ewald Wasmuth makes between the mystical in the <i>Tractatus</i> 
        (“6.44  It is not <i>how </i>things are in the world that is mystical, 
        but <i>that </i>it exists.”) and “Heidegger’s question: ‘Why are there 
        beings and not nothing?’” stating: “But it would be impossible for Wittgenstein 
        to pose such a question since he denied everything Heidegger presumed: 
        that within thinking, Being arrives in language [<i>daß im Denken das 
        Sein zur Sprache komme</i>]” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 373).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
        2.  Or the philosophical error is political, in which case Bachmann never 
        quite states it.  Nor does she furnish any evidence for such a reversal.  
        This possibility, of course, is not incompatible with the first alternative 
        just outlined, but it does draw our attention to the question of <i>Bachmann’s</i> 
        <i>silence</i> in relation to both Heidegger’s refusal to speak to the 
        events of the Second World War <i>and </i>the “terrifying silence” to 
        which Celan attempts to expose Heidegger’s speech.  Thus the “dangerous 
        half-rationalization” that Bachmann diagnoses as everywhere present in 
        Heidegger’s work becomes the half-rationalization of a danger that language 
        itself makes possible and is everywhere present in everything expressible 
        (including the “inexpressible”).  This is why we must speak of a “Verführung”—a 
        temptation, a seduction—at the heart of Heidegger’s thought, if not at 
        the heart of <i>all</i> speech and <i>all</i> thought as such.  If this 
        were not the case, then Bachmann’s perhaps most famous phrase concerning 
        the fascism that begins in the relationships between human beings would 
        have no sense.  Isn’t this the danger of Heidegger’s speech for Bachmann, 
        that it reveals an exposure of the “entirety of thought” to a temptation 
        or seduction by an “originary fascism” that threatens all speech and all 
        relation, including her own?  And isn’t this what is at stake in the “terrifying 
        silence” to which Celan responds, the possibility precisely of no longer 
        being able to respond to language’s experience of its own lack of answers 
        in a time “after Heidegger?”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span> 
        [4] </span></a></font></p>
      <p align=right style='text-align:right;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>In 
        the Penal Colony</i></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus 
        if silence pervades Bachmann’s work, it is certainly not limited to the 
        (in)expressible or the knowable but belongs rather to the spaces between 
        writing and speech, to the writing of knowledge (as <i>scientia</i>) and 
        the speech of the (in)expressible.  In resisting the suggestion of a determining 
        influence of Wittgenstein in her work, Bachmann holds that “the difference 
        between philosophy and writing is too great” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 136) 
        to constitute a direct “linguistic” correspondence.  Instead, Bachmann 
        repeats the final proposition of the <i>Tractatus</i>—“Whereof one cannot 
        speak, thereof one must remain silent”—in order to open a site at the 
        near side of the limit of the expressible.  There is no reason to avoid 
        a reading of this sort of resistance in Bachmann’s thought (which, incidentally, 
        appears continuously in her interviews); for between the writing of philosophy 
        and the writing of <i>writing</i>, there is the taking-place for Bachmann 
        of language itself, the Wittgensteinian difference between showing and 
        saying <i>as a saying</i>—a voice—of what language cannot (not) say—namely, 
        its <i>fact</i>: “only one endeavor,” she says, “is meaningful in writing: 
        that which attends to language” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 11).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> 
        [5] </span></a>  “Silence then,” writes Giorgio Agamben, “is not simply 
        a suspension of discourse, but silence of the word itself, the becoming 
        visible of the word: the idea of language” (<i>Idea of Prose</i>, 113).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
        Yet the relation of silence to the facts of language in itself would not 
        lead us back to the question of fascism as we understand it here.  Instead, 
        the silence that opens onto the fact of language makes felt the question 
        of (the violence of) relation as such. This is why when we recall the 
        “first little saying-nothing sentences [<i>die ersten kleinen nichtssagenden 
        Saetze</i>]” in <i>Malina</i> we are drawn also, as Agamben is, to the 
        “terrible secret” of the punishment of language and the guilt that precedes 
        any appearance of the word to which these saying-nothing sentences are 
        intimately connected.  In the section immediately following the one cited 
        above, Agamben writes (“in memoriam Ingeborg Bachmann”):</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A singular 
          light is thrown on Kafka’s tale of the Penal Colony when one realizes 
          that the machine of torture invented by the previous commandant of the 
          colony is in fact language.  But by the same stroke it becomes even 
          more complex.  In the tale the machine is primarily an instrument of 
          justice and punishment.  This means that, on earth and for men, language 
          is also such an instrument.  The secret of the penal colony is the same 
          as that which a character in a contemporary novel reveals in these words: 
          “I’ll let you in on a terrible secret: language is the punishment.  
          All things must enter it and perish there according to their guilt and 
          the scale of their guilt.” (<i>Idea of Prose</i>, 115, translation modified 
          / Bachmann, <i>Werke </i>III, 97)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        be sure, Bachmann never explicates the nature of this guilt, or the nature 
        of the crime, for the language in which she would do so would have been 
        already conditioned by it, just as the child who learns to say “I” does 
        so by first admitting having “done something”: “I did it, I, I, I!” (<i>Werke</i>, 
        218-219).  If the intimacy of the relation between the I, Ivan, and Malina 
        is itself conditioned by this “terrible secret” of language, as perhaps 
        all relations are, then instead of being able to decide finally on the 
        primacy of the various versions and slopes of the relation of fascism 
        to language, there arises a desire in Bachmann’s work to acknowledge fascism’s 
        sheer excess.  Not only the manner in which it exceeds the decidability 
        between the violences and genocides within history [“Unter Mödern und 
        Irren” (“Among Murderers and Madmen”), “Jugend in einer österreischisen 
        Stadt” (“Youth in an Austrian Town”)] and the “<i>gynocides</i>” within 
        the relationships between men and women (<i>Malina</i>, <i>Der Fall Franza</i>),<a href="#_edn6"
name="_ednref6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a> but also its ability to transgress 
        the events themselves and infiltrate—or as Bachmann says, infect—the very 
        voice narrating their histories.  <i>Das dreissigste Jahr</i> (<i>The 
        Thirtieth Year</i>): “I, this package composed of reflections and a well 
        brought-up will, <i>I </i>nourished by refuse from history, scraps of 
        drive and instinct, <i>I</i> with one foot in wilderness and the other 
        on the main street to eternal civilization.  <i>I impenetrable</i>, compounded 
        from all substances, clogged, insoluble, and yet able to be annihilated 
        with a blow on the back of the head. <i>I born of silence</i> and brought 
        to silence” (<i>Werke</i>, II, 102).</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If 
        the accounts that stage Bachmann’s work within the Austrian struggle with 
        history (<i>Vergangenheitsbewältigung</i>) or within the traumatic experience 
        of the history of the Second World War have any purchase, it is less for 
        their skill at employing a certain form of banal historicism and at applying 
        a certain faith in the unity of an experiencing, historical subject, than 
        for the questions that they raise concerning the paradoxical status of 
        the category of experience “today.”  We recall the I in <i>Malina</i> 
        as s/he begins the narrative by admitting that it is no longer possible 
        for her/him to say “today,” only to frame the event of the disruption 
        of the voice whose breath becomes irregular—arrhythmic—whenever it attempts 
        to break free from the banality of the tasks and happenings of the “day” 
        (<i>Werke</i>, III, 12-13).  Yet we also know that the events themselves 
        can only take place “today”; there is only “today” “after the War” [“<i>nach 
        dem Krieg</i>” (<i>Werke</i>, II, 159)].  Thus fallen outside of history, 
        “today is a word,” narrates the I, “that only those committing suicide 
        are able to use” (<i>Werke</i>, III, 13).  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">            
        Thus, in revisiting Bachmann’s Frankfurt lectures on poetics and her reflections 
        therein on the “‘I’ without guarantees” within the history of literature 
        (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 218), we cannot escape the impression that within those 
        lectures she is laying the ground for the inclusion of her own work within 
        this same history.  No longer able to say “today,” no longer able to say 
        “we,”—“we, who are preoccupied with language, have learned what speechlessness 
        and muteness are—our, if you will, purest conditions!—and have returned 
        from that no-man’s land with language which we will perpetuate as long 
        as life is our own continuation” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 60)—Bachmann’s writing 
        becomes increasingly populated with figures resembling Hofmannsthal’s 
        Lord Chandos whose “capacity for the coherency of thinking and speaking 
        has left him” and who as a result can only experience the “disintegration” 
        of “abstract words...like moldy mushrooms in the mouth” (<i>Werke</i>, 
        IV, 189).  These figures, who act but no longer see, who live (<i>erleben</i>) 
        but no longer experience (<i>erfahren</i>), reveal an “I” that is inseparable 
        from a fundamental “experience of suffering” (<i>Leiderfahrung</i>), an 
        “experience (before experience),” as Christopher Fynsk says, of the “subject.”  
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
        is meant by this, and what is the relation of this “limit-experience” 
        to literature and to writing?  Of course, we have already been exposed 
        to an answer, when Benjamin, writing of the disruption posed to storytelling 
        in the communication of experience, writes: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For never 
          has experience been contradicted more thoroughly than strategic experience 
          by tactical warfare, economic experience by inflation, bodily experience 
          by mechanical warfare, moral experience by those in power.  A generation 
          that had gone to school on a horse-drawn streetcar now stood under the 
          open sky in a countryside in which nothing remained unchanged but the 
          clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive 
          torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body. (“The Storyteller,” 
          84).</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, 
        everywhere in Bachmann, it is not so much that the events of the Second 
        World War mark an historical break as they mark a break in “history” itself, 
        a rupture in “time.”  Bachmann, quite aware of Benjamin’s distinction 
        between <i>Erlebnis </i>as “discontinuous, lived experience” and <i>Erfahrung 
        </i>as “integrated, meaningful experience,” pursues a memory similar to 
        Benjamin’s “denunciation of the aestheticization of violence and glorification 
        of the ‘fascist class warrior’” (Jay, “Walter Benjamin”) in her fragmentary 
        essay, “Auf das Opfer darf keiner sich berufen” (“The Victims Shall Not 
        Be Summoned”), where she contends: “It is not true that victims remind, 
        witness, or are testimony for anything.  That is the most terrible, thoughtless, 
        weakest poeticization...No land and no group, no idea should wake the 
        dead” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 335).  Like Benjamin, Bachmann is acutely aware 
        of what Foucault called the “fascism in us all” and terribly conscious 
        of the both the risk <i>and temptation</i> to reinscribe the violences 
        that we seek to resist.  The writer’s task, as Bachmann sees it, is to 
        confront this paradox of both memory and the “withering of experience 
        [<i>Erfahrungsschwund</i>]” by bringing—or tearing—one into the experiences 
        (“<i>Erfahrungen</i>”) that the writer creates and to withdraw one from 
        the “dangerous progress [<i>Entwicklung</i>]<i> </i>of this modern world” 
        (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 140).  It is for this reason that we can become aware 
        of “only the most powerful phrases of <i>today</i>: If we had the word, 
        if we had language, we would not need the weapons” (<i>Werke</i>, IV, 
        185, emphasis added).</font></p>
      <p align=right style='text-align:right;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“<i>a 
        human voice</i>”</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
        is the nature of this experience “created” by the writer in a time without 
        language?  Everyday is “today”, “‘<i>Nach dem Krieg</i>’—<i>dies ist die 
        Zeitrechnung </i>[‘After the War’—this is the calculation of time]” (<i>Werke</i>, 
        II, 159), a memory “touched” by the dead—these all point to the fact that, 
        as Gilles Deleuze writes, “in Europe, the post-war period has greatly 
        increased the situations which we no longer know how to describe.  These 
        were ‘any spaces whatever,’ deserted but inhabited, disused warehouses, 
        waste ground, cities in the course of demolition or reconstruction.  And 
        in these any-spaces-whatever a new race of characters was stirring, kind 
        of mutant: they saw rather than acted, they were seers” (<i>Cinema 2</i>, 
        x).  But these in no way should be understood as conditions into which 
        the historical subject is placed, as if dropped from on high and experienced 
        in a simply affected functioning of sight and sound.  Instead, they are 
        the <i>affective</i> conditions of the “subject,” what has come to be 
        the “originary” interruptions preceding the ascension of human beings 
        to language and to experience as such—that make the subject, as it were, 
        <i>possible</i>.  If space allowed, it would be necessary to elucidate 
        just what is at stake in this “possibility”—known, provisionally, as the 
        human—for thought, for language, for the ethical and the political.  Such 
        an elucidation would certainly call for both a critique of what Bachmann 
        called “the absolute complicity of words and images” (<i>Wir müssen</i>, 
        25) as well as the provocation of what she named “a human voice.”</font></p>

          What Celan indicates as a <i>Geschichtslosigkeit</i>—a “history-less-ness”
