          Howe’s work, while every bit as idiosyncratic in style as that of Language 
          poets such as Charles Bernstein, revises tradition through her self-announced 
          role as editor/interpreter of a series of prior texts.  Where Bernstein’s 
          “dysraphism” describes a poetry constructed of mis-seaming, or the radical 
          and ironic unraveling of tradition, Howe begins from a place of mis-seaming 
          and reconstructs (or sews together) traditional texts.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span> 
          [1] </span></a> Hers is a “tradition and the individual talent” with the 
          caveat that she is a woman taking her place in a largely male tradition, 
          so that she appears dysraphically in it.  She doesn’t attempt to step 
          outside tradition, but to redescribe and reframe an existing one in such 
          a way that it admits women.              </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          truest of Howe’s originary metaphors for her “place”—or lack of one—in 
          poetic tradition is that of the Harvard Library to which she was forbidden 
          access when she was a young woman.  In <i>The birth-mark: unsettling the 
          wilderness in American literary history</i>, Howe writes her own captivity 
          narrative (which is also in a sense a conversion narrative) about her 
          experience of that library as wildness. “What is forbidden is wild,” she 
          writes:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The stacks 
            of Widener Library [at Harvard, where her father taught law] and of 
            all great libraries in the world are still the wild to me.  Thoreau 
            went to the woods because he wished to live deliberately in order to 
            give a true account in his next excursion.  I go to libraries because 
            they are the ocean. (<i>TBM </i>18)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
          she went to the (ironically named) Widener Library with her father, she 
          was forced to remain outside the second-floor entrance to the stacks because, 
          as her father told her, to come in further would be to “trespass.”  She 
          waited outside the entrance while he “entered the guarded territory to 
          hunt for books”(<i>TBM</i> 18), a phrase in which “hunting” loses metaphorical 
          softening and re-acquires a violent connotation.  Howe’s status at the 
          frontier of learning made her a captive within the wilderness and so linked 
          her to Mary Rowlandson, whom she calls “the mother of us all”(<i>TBM</i> 
          167), as well as the Native Americans who are the “other” of Rowlandson’s 
          captivity narrative.  Howe writes that “a lot of my work is about breaking 
          free: starting free and being captured and breaking free again and being 
          captured again”(<i>TBM</i> 166).  She is at once lost in the wilderness 
          and denied entry into it.  The escape <i>into</i> the wilderness or library 
          will link her with the Native Americans whose lost voices so interest 
          her in <i>Singularities</i>.  But it also allies her with Mary Rowlandson’s 
          ambivalence about her captivity.  Howe’s authority stems, therefore, both 
          from a sense of being originary, a member of an oppressed group whose 
          power can only come from solidarity, and from her status as a representative 
          of the dominant culture: white, historical rather than mythical, and editorial.  
          In both cases, Howe is a “captive,” but the nature of her capitivity oscillates 
          between that of someone forbidden language and of someone, like Mary Rowlandson, 
          who lays claim to a language and set of beliefs that are not hers, but 
          those of male intermediaries—editors, publishers, authors of source texts 
          (foremost among them, the Bible).  Authority is still figured as male 
          and white, marginality as female and “other.”  Howe’s task as a poet who 
          means to call these roles into question is that of a cross-thinker who 
          fashions her role from a blending and blurring of traditional hierarchies.  
          To the extent that she succeeds at this, her poetry offers a radical new 
          interpretation of American history and literature.  To the extent that 
          she fails, merely turning the master narratives inside out, rather than 
          dispensing with them or writing new ones, her work provides us with a 
          problematic instance in the larger tradition of American works like William 
          Carlos Williams’s <i>In the American Grain</i> and earlier Puritan narratives 
          of mythologized history. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe 
          does not disdain the library, as she might; instead she infiltrates it 
          like the scout in her poem, “Thorow,” who inhabits the wilderness secretly, 
          and who alters it by seeing, not by attempting to “civilize” it.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
          [2] </span></a>  While Language writing creates a radically and self-consciously 
          “new” poetry, Howe relies on the notion that poetic authority must be 
          built upon the past and, more crucially, that there is no difference between 
          poetry and history.  What is most radical in her work is her sense that 
          the tradition is wild and that entry into the wilderness makes the poet 
          into a scout or a captive, not an empire builder.  If the scout is also 
          an editor, or a reviser, however, then her territory is still imperial 
          rather than truly egalitarian; the burden of history, for Howe, is that 
          it repeats itself, even as it is being edited.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
          authority, then, is paradoxical; while she uses elements of the historical 
          record in her poems, she does not use them as a conventional historian 
          would.  For example, in “Articulation of Sound Forms in Time,” a poem 
          I will read in more detail later on, Howe introduces a wanderer, Hope 
          Atherton, from the historical record only to assert that, since “hope” 
          is a word used to represent the feminine in our culture, “he” can be used 
          to re-tell the tale in transvestite fashion.  “Sound forms in time,” then, 
          exist at the intersection of history and language; if history is told 
          through language, and in some sense created by it, then history can be 
          changed by altering and articulating sound forms in new ways.  History 
          in Howe’s work is dependent on the procedures of language; her authority 
          as historian is based on her authority as a poet, not vice versa.  Such 
          authority, while based on the record, often depends on rhetorical moves 
          rather than the introduction of new “data”—the language, not the history, 
          takes her from one place to another.  Language is an instrument for re-creating 
          truth where none—or little—exists.  That her work’s authority is often 
          based on a sleight of hand does not, of necessity, diminish its authority, 
          which is at once reconstitutive (the feminist project of returning women 
          to the text that they’d been left out of) and “emotive” rather than “rational.”<a
  href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  Yet that authority 
          springs from the poet herself, rather than from an “objective” record; 
          Howe is, in fact, a strong critic of objectivity.  Where Howe’s work is 
          most problematic, perhaps, is in her assumption that the poet, or the 
          poet-reviser, can carry this authority on her own back, that she can create 
          out of herself a form of objectivity that is a new history through the 
          manipulation of her (and our) language.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is through the “wild” that Howe most directly links herself to Emily Dickinson 
          and stakes her claim to participate in the antinomian impulse behind Dickinson’s 
          brand of American literature. “Emily Dickinson’s writing is my strength 
          and my shelter.  I have trespassed into the disciplines of American Studies 
          and Textual Criticism through my need to fathom what wildness and absolute 
          freedom is the nature of expression”(<i>TBM</i> 2).  Howe’s freedom is 
          made, paradoxically, of a melding of voices and genres and forms, and 
          the creation of a system out of texts that attempt to destroy systems 
          that have governed them, including Puritan texts that conflate history 
          with prophecy, American with religious history.  As she explains: “By 
          choosing to install certain narratives somewhere between history, mystic 
          speech, and poetry, I have enclosed them in an organization, although 
          I know there are places no classificatory procedure can reach, where connections 
          between words and things we thought existed break off”(<i>TBM</i> 45).  
          This amazing sentence gestures toward both a system of organization and 
          classification and toward a mode of writing that is able to capture or 
          explore (in less violent terms) what lives beyond the frontier of a territory 
          we might label “intelligibility.”  What she means to accomplish is a kind 
          of hybridization of writing practices in which her authority as a poet 
          enables her to revise history, while her authority as a revisionary editor 
          allows her to turn historical documents into poetry.  Thus, the poet whose 
          collection, <i>Singularities</i>, ends with the putative name of the author, 
          “THE REVISER,” finally takes liberties not unlike those of the male editors 
          she so despises.  “It was my postmodern editorial decision,” she writes 
          in “Submarginalia,” “to turn some sections of the conversion narratives 
          and Mary Dyer’s letter into poems”(<i>TBM</i> 39).<a
  href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a>  Howe’s authority, 
          like that of the editors she attacks, is often arbitrary.  It exposes 
          the fundamental ambivalence in Howe’s work, namely her conflict with established 
          authority, which gets played out in Trojan horse fashion, as Howe adopts 
          the myths of her elders and then shows the ways in which they collapse 
          under the weight of alternative readings of history. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
          work is, in many ways, a search for a new kind of authority, one grounded 
          in the history of places rather than of ideas, yet frankly indebted to 
          those histories of ideas imposed upon places. But for her, as for the 
          Romantics, place is often another word for <i>language</i>; Howe reads 
          the landscape with the same freedom, and often the same self-referentiality, 
          as a Romantic poet.  The Romantic poet’s primary interest is not so much 
          in reproducing place as in transcending it, a motivation that complicates 
          Howe’s work, rooted as it is both in the Romantic tradition and that of 
          William Carlos Williams, Charles Olson, and other American anti-Romantic 
          poets<b>.  </b>            </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
          project, the stripping away of accretions of meaning from the historical 
          and literary record, requires an asceticism similar to that found in the 
          work of Laura (Riding) Jackson and Gertrude Stein.<a
  href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>  It may be that 
          their most significant intellectual precursors are the Puritan minister 
          and thinker, Jonathan Edwards and, less surprisingly, Emily Dickinson.  
          Howe, the descendent of them all, would lead us to that connection.  In 
          her blurred genre book of poetic criticism, <i>My Emily Dickinson</i> 
          (1985), Howe paraphrases Edwards’s argument for “each person’s active 
          participation . . . in the battle against sin.  To be in the world but 
          avoid serving Mammon, I must renounce attachment to friends and worldly 
          accomplishment”(<i>MED</i> 48).  For a poet whose religion was poetry, 
          as Howe claims was true for Dickinson, the renunciation of publication 
          is “far from being the misguided modesty of an oppressed female ego,” 
          rather, “it is a consummate Calvinist gesture of self-assertion by a poet 
          with faith to fling election loose across the incandescent shadows of 
          futurity”(<i>MED</i> 49).  Where Dickinson refuses to participate in tradition, 
          however, Howe constructs a tradition largely through her work on Dickinson.  
          For Howe, that tradition is not only made up of poetry, but also of editorship. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
          the Puritans, who distrusted language, words are material; they are allied 
          more to Mammon than to spirit.  Howe describes the necessary Puritan renunciation 
          of Mammon in and through language that echoes Williams in <i>In the American 
          Grain</i> and his review of Marianne Moore as a writer whose words are 
          “clean” and free of an “aroma.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span> 
          [6] </span></a>  Howe writes: “If language imposes on the understanding 
          names which familiarity has deadened, how does a minister preach a sermon 
          when words and images have become predictable?”(<i>MED</i> 50)  The answer 
          comes through a process of denuding language, purifying it, stripping 
          off its metaphorical clothing: “Ideas must be stripped to their essence, 
          rhetorical embroidery torn off”(<i>MED</i> 50).  Howe makes the connection 
          to Dickinson, whom she sees as a poet of positive negation: “The recipient 
          of a letter, or combination of letter and poem from Emily Dickinson, was 
          forced much like Edwards’ listening congregation, through shock and through 
          subtraction of the ordinary, to a new way of perceiving”(<i>MED</i> 51).  
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          an America where, as Kenneth Dauber argues, “authority is . . . defined 
          as rhetorical from the very start”(52), Dickinson’s authority comes out 
          of a rhetoric of subtraction.  Stephen Greenblatt might be describing 
          her (and Howe) when he writes about the Protestant ethos of Tynedale that 
          “the Protestant discourse of self [emerges] out of conflicting impulses: 
          rage against authority and identification with authority”(85).  For Howe, 
          the original instance of this conflict from within the highly prized notion 
          of authority was the Antinomian controversy of the late 1630s, at whose 
          center was a woman, Anne Hutchinson.  Hutchinson, according to David D. 
          Hall, represented a Puritan belief system that put an emphasis on inner 
          spiritual experience.  Like Dickinson, Hutchinson “devalued the outward 
          material world”(xi) and claimed the authority of her own inspiration.  
          In so doing, she “was openly defying the hierarchical authority that men 
          derived from their gender, and from gender-restricted learning”(xi).  
          As a result of her “enthusiasm” and her claim to possess authority in 
          her own right, Hutchinson was banished, denied even the knowledge of where 
          she was being exiled.  In an interesting, but in many ways typical, conflation 
          of nature and history, Howe writes that Hutchinson was then “murdered 
          in the natural wilderness by history”(<i>TBM</i> 4).  The “natural wilderness” 
          becomes less natural when it is implicated in the historical event of 
          a woman’s exile.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe 
          claims for Dickinson a similar fate—Dickinson who is as wild as her name’s 
          etymology: “Emily: Feminine of the Teutonic Emil, ‘the industrious,’ stems 
          from Amalia of the ancient Goths; and Amalia, or Amelia, goes back to 
          the wild forest people known as the Ameler”(<i>MED</i> 65).  Although 
          Howe does not see Dickinson’s non-publication as banishment but as an 
          instance of self-assertion, she thinks of the male editors of Dickinson’s 
          work as literary policemen bent on taming the poet’s natural wildness.  
          In this they are in some ways like the male editors of conversion and 
          captivity narratives in New England: “A woman, afraid of not speaking 
          well, tells her story to a man who writes it down. . . All testimonies 
          are bereft, brief, hungry, pious, authorized”(Caldwell 50).  Patricia 
          Caldwell uses a concept that is crucial to Howe’s sense of her own work, 
          namely the “stammer”: “many of these voices were not so much crying in 
          the wilderness as they were stammering to themselves in the dark.  But 
          they did talk, because they had to”(114-5).  The verb construction “had 
          to” is provocatively ambiguous here; not only did Puritans have to speak 
          of their experiences in the New World due to their severity and strangeness, 
          but these women spoke through the medium of male editors.  Their conversions 
          were double, for not only did their spiritual worlds change, but so did 
          their actual words.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
          women’s words were, from the beginning, transcribed and edited by men, 
          Howe begins <i>The birth-mark: unsettling the wilderness in American literary 
          history</i> by connecting a rejection of antinomianism to editorial practice: 
          “The issue of editorial control is directly connected to the attempted 
          erasure of antinomianism in our culture.  Lawlessness seen as negligence 
          is at first feminized and then restricted or banished”(1).  Such lawlessness 
          disturbs the very commerce of a society that places commercial value—however 
          little—on words: “The trace of her unapprehended passage through letters 
          disturbs the order of a world where commerce is reality and authoritative 
          editions freeze poems into artifacts”(<i>TBM</i> 19).  Like Hutchinson, 
          Dickinson is “tamed,” disciplined, frozen, and then frozen-out.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dickinson 
          lived, according to Howe, “really alone at a real frontier, dwelling in 
          Possibility”(<i>MED</i> 76).  It can be no mistake, then, that Howe devotes 
          so much space and energy in her book about Dickinson to that poet’s frontier 
          poem written in the midst of the Civil War, “My Life had stood—a Loaded 
          Gun,” which Howe describes further as having as its subject “the lust 
          for power”(<i>MED </i>85).  Power, as Dickinson and Howe know, “will always 
          demand sacrifice and subjugation of one group by another”(<i>MED </i>93) 
          and also demands the creation of authority through a demonization of the 
          “other.” As Stephen Greenblatt writes in <i>Renaissance Self-Fashioning: 
          From More to Shakespeare</i> (1980), a book whose influence Howe acknowledges, 
          “Self-fashioning is achieved in relation to something perceived as alien, 
          strange, or hostile.  This threatening Other... must be discovered or 
          invented in order to be attacked and destroyed”(9). Historiographer Hayden 
          White also writes about the notion of “wildness” as part of “a set of 
          culturally self-authenticating devices” and asserts that, “like the Puritans 
          who came after him, Augustine found that one way of establishing the ‘meaning’ 
          of his own life was to deny meaning to anything radically different from 
          it, except as anti-type or negative instance”(151).  In terms historically, 
          if not psychologically, closer to Howe’s own, Richard Slotkin writes that, 
          “in opposing the Indian culture, the Puritan symbolically affirmed his 
          Englishness”(22).  Eric Cheyfitz goes even further when he writes: “As 
          Cronon’s seventeenth-century Puritans were meeting his seventeenth-century 
          Algonquians, the Puritan’s God, we might say, was becoming truly American 
          (as opposed to Native American): the ultimate individual, the infinite 
          proprietor”(55).  Michel de Certeau helps us to make a link between the 
          notion of a wildness considered “other” and Howe’s declaration that this 
          move often depends on the “feminization” of the concepts.  De Certeau 
          is interested in “the possessed woman, the victim”(245) and writes that 
          “there must always be a gap between what the possessed woman utters and 
          what the demonological or medical discourse makes of it”(247).  To that, 
          Howe would add “editorial discourse,” or that which tames the possessed 
          woman’s wildness (an especially evocative phrase when it is applied to 
          a poet) by invisibly closing the gap between the woman’s words and the 
          way in which those words are printed.  She also notes that, “If you are 
          a woman, archives hold perpetual ironies.  Because the gaps and silences 
          are where you find yourself”(<i>TBM </i>158).  While print traditionally 
          and historically is identified with power, de Certeau makes a fine distinction 
          between the power of possession, which “is only a voice”(254) and writing, 
          which possesses: “a person cannot be possessed while writing”(254).  Women, 
          whose power is here figured as “voice,” lose power when their words are 
          translated, edited, into print, which is a mechanism to control “possession.”  
          In Trinh T. Minh-ha’s terms, the dominant culture imposes a mode of writing 
          on minorities (and, one imagines Howe would insist, on women): “The Well 
          Written.  The master-servant’s creed carries on: <i>you must learn</i> 
          through patience and discipline”(16-17).  Thus self-possession becomes 
          the opposite of “possession,” and the poet must govern her tongue even 
          as she rescues it from an internalized editorial (magisterial) conscience.

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          most of her work, Howe mixes genres, moving between prose and poetry, 
          explication and enactment, performing her dual authority as historian 
          and poet.  If we are to look at her work within the context of its time, 
          we see that Howe is not alone in her blending of genres; she is, in fact, 
          very much a thinker of her own time in this assertion that, in some profound 
          sense, the only contemporary or postmodern genre is a mixed one.  I would 
          like to explore the ways in which her poetic practice enacts a theoretical 
          stance adopted in the 1970s by two historiographers, Hayden White and 
          Michel de Certeau<b>, </b>whose work I have briefly cited already.  I 
          do this so that I can better discuss Howe’s own conflation of history 
          with poetry, her claim to authority as a chronicler of histories that 
          happened but were not written down.  White and de Certeau argue in remarkably 
          similar terms that historical narratives cannot be distinguished from 
          other kinds of narratives, that history and fiction have more affinities 
          than differences.  Furthermore, they claim that the writing of history 
          is based on linguistic practices usually associated with poetry or poetic 
          thinking.  White and de Certeau respond to what they see as a lack of 
          engagement by other writers with their subject; White claims that a good 
          deal of twentieth-century literature is hostile toward historical thinking.(31)<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span> 
          [7] </span></a>  Their response to the de-authorization of history is 
          to re-claim its authority by redescribing it, enlarging its field, opening 
          its borders to the alien, the “other.”             </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her essay, “Incloser,” Howe writes that “knowledge, no matter how I get 
          it, involves exclusion and repression”(<i>TBM</i> 45).  Perhaps the most 
          significant exclusion involves the process by which knowledge is made 
          or acquired, a process that often relies on fictions, supreme or not.  
          White, in his collection, <i>Tropics of Discourse: Essays in</i> <i>Cultural 
          Criticism</i> (1978), argues that history is created out of the process 
          of telling it, “all discourse constitutes the objects which it pretends 
          only to describe realistically and to analyze objectively”(2).  Historians 
          work from a pre-existing set of explanatory paradigms, rather like a reservoir 
          of plot-lines for dramatic productions; they take the material generated 
          by their research and plug it into the paradigm that seems most reasonable 
          to them.  For this reason, history is not so much an objective chronicle 
          of unique events, but something that happens over and again because the 
          number of plot structures are necessarily limited.  “There has been a 
          reluctance to consider historical narratives as what they most manifestly 
          are,” he discerns, “verbal fictions, the contents of which are as much 
          <i>invented</i> as <i>found</i> and the forms of which have more in common 
          with the counterparts in literature than they have with those in the sciences”(82).  
          Thus histories are, like literary texts, symbolic organisms, not one-of-a-kinds.  
          They are “fashions” that can be reproduced over and again, fashions that 
          change over time.  White’s most radical statement to this effect is that 
          “it does not matter whether the world is conceived to be real or only 
          imagined; the manner of making sense of it is the same”(98).  History, 
          then, is a rhetorical activity, not a scientific one, and the historian, 
          like the American authors discussed by Kenneth Dauber, creates authority 
          through style rather than through documentation.  The effect of this questioning 
          of history’s authority is extreme, for it calls into question the discipline 
          itself, much as Howe’s poetry interrogates the notion of what makes a 
          poet separate from a historian, an editor, or a prophet.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
          White believes that history and literature are like-minded in this way, 
          he declares history’s authority to be poetic instead of scientific.  For 
          him, metaphorical consciousness is “every bit as authoritative as logic 
          itself”(10).  He refuses to separate categories like “myth” and “poetry” 
          and “history” from each other, or to assign to the first two the label 
          of “primitive” and to the latter that of “civilized”(104).  De Certeau 
          develops this line of thinking further, arguing that “history becomes 
          the myth of language,” and, more radically, that the very documents used 
          to create histories are themselves invented.  In describing his notion 
          of what becomes historical documentation, he uses a word crucial to Howe's 
          definitions of history and poetry, namely “scatter.”  “[History’s] work 
          consists in creating the absent, in making signs scattered over the surface 
          of current times become the traces of ‘historical’ realities, missing 
          indeed because they are other”(46).  Thus the historian is the “poet of 
          meticulous detail”(80), historical “facts” are “figures”(85), and “historical 
          figures” are “dummies”(9).  Whether it is considered to be myth or history, 
          however, chronicles of the Puritans’ sojourn in the New World create authority 
          for their tellers and for the community those tellers represent.  There 
          is, as Richard Slotkin puts it, “a constellation of compelling metaphors”(6) 
          that transforms knowledge into power.(7)  And so, as Howe writes, Mary 
          Rowlandson creates a personal narrative that is once social history and 
          mythology: “Each time an errant perception skids loose, she controls her 
          lapse by vehemently invoking biblical authority”(<i>TBM</i> 100).  As 
          Sacvan Bercovitch has so persuasively written, the Puritans attempted 
          to create history out of their belief in religious symbology; history, 
          for John Cotton, was backdated prophecy.  History is controlled by the 
          interpretation of it. He writes, “The American jeremiad was born in an 
          effort to impose metaphor upon reality”(<i>AJ</i> 62) or, as Howe might 
          put it, to make scattered reality fit the traces of metaphor.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
          course the creation of history through metaphor was assigned only to certain 
          members of the community; metaphor, which can be more wild than regulatory, 
          was intended by Puritan fathers to help create an official story, not 
          competing narratives.  As Eric Cheyfitz has argued, “from its theoretical 
          beginnings, then, metaphor comes under suspicion as the foreign, that 
          which is opposed to the ‘proper,’ defined inescapably...as the <i>national</i>, 
          the <i>domestic</i>, the <i>familiar</i>, the <i>authoritative</i>, the 
          <i>legitimate</i>”(90).  Metaphor, which exists at the “frontier between 
          the national and the foreign”(94), is used by the powerful to patrol that 
          boundary, not pull it down.  “The master struggles to deny the slave access 
          to the full potency of language, that is, eloquence, by asserting the 
          frontier of decorum as an absolute, or natural, frontier”(172).  By now 
          it should be clear that Howe is most interested in “figures” that crossed 
          that frontier and were “tamed” by the editors who have policed the frontier 
          since the origins of American thought and literature.  Hence her interest 
          in the “Scapegoat Dialectic”(<i>TBM</i> 53), enforced against women who 
          refuse to acknowledge the pre-existing boundaries of the Puritans’ decorous 
          metaphorical self-definition.  The danger consists in creating new metaphors; 
          where the metaphor of enforcement insists on Rowlandson’s comparison of 
          herself to a biblical character foisted into the wilderness only later 
          to be saved, Rowlandson’s own occasional comparison of her Indian captors 
          to her own people is dangerous to the definition of the white community.  
          Thus she ends up writing a narrative that continually undoes itself, one 
          whose metaphors work to unravel rather than adjudicate the boundaries 
          between world-views.  Howe writes: “Mary Rowlandson’s thoroughly reactionary 
          figuralism requires that she obsessively confirm her orthodoxy to readers 
          at the same time she excavates and subverts her own rhetoric”(<i>TBM</i> 
          100).  Howe’s own blurring of the boundaries of genre is intended to redefine 
          history and poetry in such a way as to give power to the voice of Rowlandson’s 
          subversions, to undo some metaphors so that others can be installed in 
          their stead.  While Howe joins White and de Certeau as fellow-thinkers 
          of this re-placing of genres, she does it with an explicitly feminist 
          agenda in mind; the “possessed” women about whom they write become her 
          historians; they come to re-possess the very histories that have excluded 
          them.  So Howe takes their manifestos of history’s affinities to literature 
          and enacts them through the figures of Puritan histories.  </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My 
          reading of “Articulation of Sound Forms in Time”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span> 
          [8] </span></a> makes two main arguments.  The first argument is that 
          Howe writes an American epic in reverse, in which she endeavors to undo 
          the story told to us by the Puritans, that this poem is more like Williams’s 
          <i>In the American Grain</i> than it is like a Puritan jeremiad.  By performing 
          and taking apart the central ideologies that separate Puritan theology 
          from the native American context in which they found themselves, Howe 
          aims to get back to a point where the story can begin again, where it 
          can be more inclusive.  She also wants to tell the story that the historians 
          did not: on the first page of “Articulation,” she writes of a white attack 
          on an Indian camp, “What the historian doesn’t say is that most of the 
          dead were women and children.”  The function of the poet-historian, then, 
          is to re-imagine the past so as to tell it again more completely, a role 
          that makes the poet into a self-conscious creator of fictions.  Yet, because 
          <i>new</i> stories, according to a thinker like White, do not exist, Howe’s 
          “Articulation” does not so much tell a new story as attempt to deconstruct 
          the old.  What is new about her story is the way in which it dismantles 
          the old narrative, not the way she invents a new one; in that sense, she 
          is faithful to the historical record, which holds her to the gaps rather 
          than liberating her out of them.  The second argument is that Howe’s epic 
          is a feminine one, but that her rewriting of the narrative is at times 
          undermined by the underlying structure of her story.  To use de Certeau 
          for a moment: Howe reaches for the paradigm that best fits her historical 
          details, but the best paradigm proves to be the old one with significant 
          details transfigured.  The way in which she tells the story in reverse, 
          however, subverts the very authority of that paradigm.  What she aims 
          for, then, is a kind of revelatory impasse, one that returns us to an 
          origin so that what accrues are fragments of what she calls, in “Thorow,” 
          “narrative in non-narrative,” or a poetic history that acknowledges gaps 
          and questions its own authority in so doing.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          first of Howe’s transfigurations is the name-change operation that she 
          makes in her proem, “The Falls Fight,” where the American wanderer, Reverend 
          Hope Atherton, is by fiat re-“figured” as a woman.  ‘In our culture,” 
          she writes, “Hope is a name we give women.  Signifying desire, trust, 
          promise, does her name prophetically engender pacification of the feminine?”(<i>S</i> 
          4)  The answer to this question is complicated, since in some ways it 
          does; the wanderer, Hope Atherton, is a white American (man or woman or 
          word) lost in the wilderness of native America.  Howe’s attitude toward 
          Hope resembles her attitude toward Rowlandson; Howe at once admires Rowlandson’s 
          resilience, her ability to survive and to write about her experiences, 
          and disdains her constant use of biblical authority to render the Indians 
          as savages.  Hope is, like Rowlandson, an ambivalent character.  The extent 
          to which the narrative is predetermined is made clear in Howe's notion 
          of the origin of the poem itself.  “Hope’s epicene name draws its predetermined 
          poem in,”(<i>S</i> 4) she writes, asserting that her poem, too, comes 
          of the kind of “Postdated Prophesie” alluded to in her quotation from 
          John Cotton.  The only way for the poet to liberate herself from the pre-conceived 
          narrative is through the work of de-mythologization, work that she accomplishes 
          by ending this poem with only the “Rubble couple on pedestal” remaining 
          (<i>S</i> 38).  “I assume Hope Atherton’s excursion for an emblem foreshadowing 
          a Poet’s abolished limitations in our demythologized fantasy of Manifest 
          Destiny”(<i>S</i> 4).  The poet, then, has imperial designs of her own; 
          only when she undoes the myth of Manifest Destiny can her poetry break 
          the bounds imposed on it by the very force of that myth on American letters.            
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How 
          does one untell a myth, demythologize a fantasy?  Howe does so, in part, 
          by setting up dichotomous terms to represent Puritan thinking and that 
          of the Native Americans<b> </b>they displace.  The most basic of these 
          dichotomies is that of “system” or “logic,” which is Puritan, and “intuition” 
          or “lack of system” (which is the “other”).  The world the Puritans enter 
          is soon reduced to the grids that they place upon it, grids that Howe 
          imitates on some of her pages, which are covered with fields of words 
          arranged in rows.  Thus, in “Taking the Forest,” she writes of “Universal 
          separation / —Distant coherent rational system” and of “Consciousness 
          [that] grasps its subject / Stumbling phenomenology // infinite miscalculation 
          of history”(<i>S</i> 17).  That this system is created somehow counter 
          to historical process becomes clear later on: “total systemic circular 
          knowledge / System impossible in time,” which is promptly called into 
          question by “truant freedom of dream”(<i>S</i> 28).  Systems are necessary 
          to the act of “possession”; late in the poem, when Howe invokes Columbus’s 
          voyage she connects western system-making (“World as rigorously related 
          System”) to the destruction of “pagan worlds”(<i>S </i>38).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          first of Howe’s mirror pages presents the reader with a grid of words 
          on the left-hand side of the opened book, and a similar grid on the right—one 
          that is a mirror image of the first, with spaces between words erased 
          so as to create one long, rather Germanic looking, word.  The function 
          of these grids is to present the conflict between world-views and, perhaps, 
          to gesture toward a way beyond the conflict.  On the one hand, Howe presents 
          us with “system” words: “border,” “possess,” “empirical,” “Kantian,” and 
          “force”; on the other, mixed in with these words, she provides: “<i>is</i>,” 
          “open,” “Halo,” “Maoris,” and “Immanence”(<i>S </i>14).  The fact that 
          these words are separated on the first page imitates the separations caused 
          by the systematizing imagination.  On the second page, these words run 
          together in reverse; taking from the middle of the grid: &quot;AkantianEmpiricalMaorisHumTemporal-spatioLostAreLifeAbstractSoRemotePossessRedden 
          Border” and so on.(<i>S</i> 15)  But the most important word on both sides 
          of this double page is the one that starts the grid on the left and which 
          concludes it on the right, namely “is,” a word that suggests process, 
          history, becoming, and a lack of system.  So the second grid becomes an 
          answer to the first.  As the poem moves forward, it becomes clear that 
          Howe believes the myth must incorporate both these ways of thinking, that 
          neither should possess the other, even if (or especially because) the 
          end result is an undoing of both; thus she posits “Untraceable wandering” 
          against the next line, “the meaning of knowing”(<i>S</i> 25) and “Kneel 
          to intellect in our work” against “Chaos cast cold intellect back”(<i>S</i> 
          34).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          yet these binaries are, of course, too simple to be trusted entirely to 
          do their own work.  So we begin from the rather more complicated Hope 
          Atherton, the Puritan every-man/woman, wanderer in a wilderness that is 
          at once the land and his own mind.  Howe effectively collapses her symbology 
          inward when she creates this “figure” (he/she is not really a character), 
          because this character at once serves to organize her text, by giving 
          it a fulcrum to work around, and helps to unravel that text by valuing 
          “wandering” (like the later term, “scattering”) over stasis.  Though a 
          kind of hero in Howe’s book, as he/she might have been in Williams’s <i>In 
          the American Grain</i>, where the only American successes are seen to 
          be its failures, Hope’s historical fate was more absurd and more unhappy.  
          According to a letter of Stephen Williams in 1781, which is quoted in 
          the text, Hope offered to surrender to the enemy, but they wouldn’t have 
          him.(<i>S</i> 5)  In her own introduction, Howe relates that, “No one 
          believed the Minister’s letter.  He became a stranger to his community 
          and died soon after the traumatic exposure that has earned him poor mention 
          in a seldom opened book”(<i>S</i> 4).  Thus, like the text itself, Hope 
          begins as a paradigmatic figure and dissolves into language like the systems 
          he at first represents (religious and historical).  His function is also 
          linguistic; not only is Hope re-born as a word (“hope for the artist in 
          America”) and as a woman because of the “nature” of his name, but he also 
          reveals that he speaks the language not of this place but of England.  
          Thus, in “Hope Atherton’s Wanderings,” note the English accent on “matah” 
          and “chirah”:</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
          critique here resembles Williams’s; Williams points out that early immigrants 
          from England, lacking words for animals they had never seen, still assigned 
          the names of animals they knew well, calling the new bird a “robin” because 
          they knew that “robin” was the name for a bird.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Part 
          of the unraveling effect of Howe’s own text occurs, not surprisingly, 
          in and through language.  She is especially effective when she puns between 
          the world and its words, when she attempts to make the landscape into 
          language by echoing it (the verbal equivalent of her mirroring of texts).  
          So, in a section that begins, “Bound Cupid sea washed,” namely with a 
          western mythological figure bound and suffering in the wilderness, she 
          writes: “Cries open to the words inside them / Cries hurled through the 
          Woods”(<i>S</i> 23).  Here the inner (words) become one with the outer 
          (Woods) and both scream out their pain at what must be seen as a bad “translation” 
          of one mythology onto a new place.  Then, in a section that begins again 
          with a search, “Left home to seek Lost // Pitchfork origin,” two things 
          are made (nearly) synonymous through this sound play: “tribunal of eternal 
          revolution / tribunal of rigorous revaluation”(<i>S</i> 25).  Similar 
          moments of transfiguration occur in the phrases, “Collision or collusion 
          with history,” where in fact both words are true; “Milestones bewitched 
          millstones”(<i>S</i> 35); and at the end (that is the beginning) of the 
          poem, “Lif sails off longing for life”(<i>S</i> 38).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          Howe has done, then, is to take a historical system, that of the Puritans, 
          and desystematize it, in part by telling the story backwards, so that 
          we end with Lif [Erickson] rather than beginning with him, as Williams 
          does.  To desystematize history is to render it as myth, fiction, story, 
          rather than assume its scienticity or truth-as-fact.  This beginning has 
          itself been altered; it is not a real origin, but one that is achieved 
          through destruction, that re-arrives at a destructive moment created by 
          “Stern norse terse ethical pathos”(<i>S</i> 38).  Rather than recovering 
          the Garden of Eden for its notorious couple, Howe recovers ruin—scattering—albeit 
          in a state of nature:</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          Howe does with the repeated wordplay, which here at the end involves the 
          nearly comical sound of “rubble couple,” is to show (quite artfully) how 
          the deformations of language, how its accidents, collide and collude with 
          history.  A rubble couple is not gendered, either, but only the remnant 
          of a cultural structure that takes gender as its primary sign.  More importantly, 
          what this shows is how history can be revised through language itself.  
          This is where Howe comes closest, I suspect, to being among the visionary 
          company of Language poets, although her puns are much more considered 
          than are, say, those of Charles Bernstein.  Through an oxymoronic principle 
          of scatter, Howe shows how history can, in some sense, become prophecy—in 
          counter-movement to John Cotton’s assertion that history is postdated 
          prophecy.  It can prophesy its own end, at the beginning.  The end of 
          “Articulation of Sound Forms in Time” is, therefore, not quite an end 
          or a beginning, rather a beginning in the end of American myth, which 
          is also history.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Howe’s 
          work emerges from a paradoxical crossroads in thinking through the relationship 
          between history and imaginative writing.  On the one hand, in their work 
          of the 1970s, White and de Certeau were invested in presenting history 
          as the work of writing that comes out of the same process as fiction or 
          poetry; history is little more than the historian’s imaginative reconstruction 
          of it.  The historian’s authority is located not in the <i>truths</i> 
          he or she discovers in the archive, but in his or her way of writing.  
          Style <i>is</i> substance.  On the other hand and at the same time, literary 
          theorists like Stephen Greenblatt and other New Historicists were searching 
          for a way out of text-only systems of literary criticism that had installed 
          themselves in the academy since mid-century; I’m thinking here of New 
          Criticism and deconstruction.  They found this new way in history and 
          the authority it provided literary critics in examining texts as symptoms 
          of larger cultural and historical issues rather than as “well wrought 
          urns,” either intact or shattered.  The authority they reached for was 
          old-fashioned in the terms set forth by White and de Certeau, but their 
          mode of writing criticism and history relied in great measure on precisely 
          the generic blurring of poetry, narrative, and history that interested 
          these historiographers.  Howe’s blurring of genres and authorities, her 
          paradoxical and sometimes simultaneous deconstructions and reconstructions 
          of history, participate in this intellectual intersection.  Her obsession 
          with authority, even as she tries to dismantle it, is symptomatic of her 
          time.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span> [9] </span></a>

            their book, <i>Literatures of Memory: History, time and space in postwar

            conviction among literary and cultural critics and these historians, 
            that the past has been killed, destroyed, lost or at best thinned out 
            so much that it no longer seems relevant”(9).  Their book offers important 
            testimony that this is, in fact, not the case—that “even avant-garde 
            poetry...still devotes much of its inventive energy to rethinking the 
            relations between poetic form, individual memory, history and temporality”(188).  
            Middleton and Woods are most interested in the ways in which poets present 
            personal memory, however.  The poets they discuss are more mainstream, 
            conventionally lyrical, than is Howe.  </font></p>
