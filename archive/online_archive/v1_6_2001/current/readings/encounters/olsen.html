            In the introduction to your interviews with John Cage you say that there 
            came a time in your life when you no longer wanted literature to be 
            a fictive time machine that would whisk you away. I wonder if you could 
            say something about that change in your attitude to reading?</font></p>

            </b>That comment actually had a couple of sources, the major one being 
            the use to which I put literature as a child and teenager. I read fiction 
            heavily as escape, to have some rest from the pressures of the world 
            but I also thought I was learning a lot about the world from it. I started 
            in my mid-twenties to discover that I wasn’t learning much at all about 
            how to live from novels, that I was instead learning a lot about characters 
            locked in a very closed system. I realized that what I was experiencing 
            was one person’s mind, the mind of the author. So at some point—I didn’t 
            frame it this way early on—I really began to see that kind of work as 
            having to do with a vanishing point perspective, that everything was 
            moving toward the last punctum where the conflict—the conflict that 
            had been artificially imported in the first place—would be resolved, 
            would disappear. It seemed to me that all this existed outside of real 
            time in some consequential way.</font></p>

            I realize the notion of real time can be problematic. Real time as opposed 
            what other sort of time? But actually we do construct very different 
            kinds of experiences of time in literature and one is that alternative 
            time where there can’t be interruptions, there can’t be certain kinds 
            of disjunctions.</font></p>

            So finding Cage’s work offered a way in which you could allow disjunction 
            and at the same time intersect practice with life?</font></p>

            </b>Well really meeting Cage, after having experienced his work with 
            Merce Cunningham as a startling reorientation of the way I was experiencing 
            space-time, quite literally gave me a sense of there not being a need 
            to have certain privileged beginnings leading to a very specific and 
            precious kind of development. Instead, one as a person living one’s 
            life as artist could simply exist at whatever intersection in space-time 
            one found oneself and explore that and bring that into the work. The 
            necessity, the formal necessity, was doing the work in such a way that 
            it was open to the traffic in the intersection, [<i>sound of sirens 
            from outside</i>] that it didn’t close down and section it off: “NO 
            TRAFFIC HERE, PRIVATE PARTY GOING ON” [<i>more sirens outside</i>].</font></p>

            </b>And were you writing your own work at the time you were making these 
            decisions?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            I was. I was writing, I was also doing visual art, also studying philosophy, 
            I was doing a number of things, I can’t say simultaneously, but interweaving 
            these things. Actually that’s inaccurate because they weren’t interwoven. 
            That suggests some kind of planned connectedness. There wasn’t at first. 
            I really thought of myself as needing to do visual things—finding time 
            to do that, needing to do philosophical things—finding time to do that, 
            needing to do writing/reading of literature. Eventually, the distinctions 
            between these genres began to collapse. I began to see, read, write 
            in relation to philosophy as literature and text as visual, graphic 
            space.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            I noticed that in your conversations with Cage he uses the verb to “make” 
            rather than to “write” and I was wondering how important that distinction 
            is to you?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well it’s not of such urgency that I’ve cleansed my vocabulary of any 
            other way of talking about it but I think that “to make” is at the heart 
            of it, yes. Poetics is at the heart of the action of writing, thinking, 
            in one way or another. Configuring things in the world as a continual 
            invention of the forms of an ongoing dynamics. One lives this poetics 
            in relation to other things going on in and around one. Nicely, “to 
            make” is the root meaning of poesis, so I do think of myself always 
            as involved with poetics, whatever I’m doing, whether it be visual, 
            sound, or writing because of that meaning of poetics-making.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            I was thinking about terminology because I know that when I was speaking 
            to you yesterday you picked up on my repeated use of the word “chance” 
            as problematic. I just wondered if you could say a bit more about how 
            you want to describe the process of making poetry?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well, to change the terminology, when thinking about procedures, methods, 
            I tend to think first about sources and then about using and composing 
            them with intersecting random elements. Chance is something that is 
            happening all the time. It’s inflecting and perforating everything we 
            do anyway. So I think any valuing of that foregrounds chance, makes 
            it part of the qualitative dimension of one’s work. Now to actually 
            play with chance, to try to make things happen by chance is a very different 
            thing, one of many possibilities in making. I mean I think there are 
            procedures that have more to do with constraint and game playing among 
            limited possibilities—for instance Oulipean kinds of approaches—and 
            there are procedures that are designed to open up the work to things 
            outside its internal logics, to let more in.  I tend to think of those 
            [latter] as having more to do with chance. To say that you are really 
            allowing chance elements in you have to have very rigorous procedures 
            that you follow very faithfully, not cheating. [<i>laughter</i>] Because 
            what chance procedures do, or “chance operations” as Cage called them, 
            more than procedures of constraint, is to move you outside predictable 
            consequences of intentional structures. Procedures of constraint reflect 
            your preferences for a kind of intentionality that knows what’s coming 
            down the road, to a great extent what the logics, if not the specific 
            textual events, will be. Chance operations really should change the 
            logics, there will still be patterns but there should be less of a sense 
            of what is just around the corner.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            And does that mean in a sense that its a very, I don’t know if the right 
            word is political, but it’s very much process that is directly linked 
            to the way in which you want to act in terms of the world, to change 
            it?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Yes, to get back to the time machine question I don’t want to seal myself 
            off. I don’t want to get into the time machine and pretend that it’s 
            not 1999 and that we don’t have unintelligibilities all around us that 
            we can’t turn into the known. Whether this is a politics, I don’t know. 
            That might be too grand a construct.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO: 
            </b>You’ve said that you see the role of the artist as one of optimist 
            in the face of society’s fragmentation and cultural disillusionment...do 
            you still think that?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well the optimism has to do with the ability, the capacity to go on 
            in the face of all that tells you you won’t be able to do anything that 
            helps, you won’t be able to do anything really new. I like the enterprise 
            of optimism, of setting up ways to live so that you might just be pleasantly 
            surprised. What that involves is more than politics, it’s an ethos, 
            a way of living that values the situation we find ourselves in—not trying 
            to transcend or abstract oneself from it, but to use it.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            And provide a critique of it?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well I suppose that is where the politics comes in because there are 
            a series of value judgments involved that have to do with what is hindering 
            or furthering the ability of people to live in vital and satisfying 
            ways. For me that means being in touch with the actual world you’re 
            living in, so that you can notice the really terrible things that are 
            going on and try to do something about them. Noticing—not explaining 
            things away—is itself a political act. One can also notice extraordinary 
            things, delightful things that haven’t been labeled as such yet and 
            are therefore ignored, invisible, silent.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO: 
            </b>To go back to what we were talking about in the beginning the whole 
            space-time question. I’m interested in it in relation to the white paintings 
            by Mark Tobey and Robert Ryman that I know Cage was also interested 
            in. When you were talking to Cage you talked about how “time can become 
            space on a page” and how “silence is the white space.” And I just wondered 
            if in a sense there are any equivalencies to be made between white paintings 
            and silence and the gaps and the spaces in your work? Or, are these 
            connections more to do with Cage himself?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            The white paintings are very important to me as well although I came 
            to them through Cage. I saw Rauschenberg’s white paintings again maybe 
            eight or nine years ago. There was a small show at the Corcoran Gallery 
            in Washington D.C. and I thought, well I already know this but I’m going 
            to go and see it again anyway, and then I didn’t know them at all, they 
            were completely different from what I had remembered. </font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO: 
            </b>I was just wondering about the edges of words as they appear in 
            your work, particularly in <i>Afterrimages</i> or in <i>Errata 5uite</i>. 
            If what’s being drawn attention to is the whiteness behind the fragments 
            of words either as a space of silence or...</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            I think the silence is in the words as well. You can take Cage’s redefinition 
            of silence to mean that it (silence) is what we’re not noticing at any 
            given moment. So when I use unusual syntax or edges of words I do tend 
            to think about this spatially as a mode of drawing attention to both 
            syntactical and semantic silences. These disruptions foreground connections 
            and associations between parts of words that you don’t normally notice. 
            This kind of language play makes new intersections, new ways of finding 
            meaning. One is turning with interest toward silence—the silence of 
            unintelligibility—and finding surprising things there. That’s much more 
            interesting to me than the analogue, white space equals silence.</font></p>

            </b>I was wondering about this space of “unintelligibility” in relation 
            to Wittgenstein’s idea about poetry not being involved in a language 
            game of “giving information.” Does this take poetry too far away into 
            a separate sphere? </font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR: 
            </b>The most recent thing that I’ve published is called <i>Mongrelisme: 
            a difficult manual for desperate times</i>. It’s entirely couched as 
            information. In fact the first and last pages are a wallpaper made of 
            the word INFORMATION INFORMATION INFORMACION INFORMAZIONE. Just that 
            word in multiple languages. So it’s not that information or the use 
            of language to give information are excluded from my poetics, it’s that 
            I feel we have to bring language into the dynamic exchange that is doing 
            things other than giving information, in addition to giving information, 
            in complex multiplication of information. But the whole question about 
            what it means to give information at this point is a fascinating one. 
            That’s a large part of what I’m exploring in that piece and there is 
            a way in which I actually am trying to transmit information. </font></p>

            How do you feel about Wittgenstein’s idea of language as a game?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            This is an enormously useful way of thinking about everything from genres 
            to habits of everyday speech. Every language game makes certain things 
            possible, has limits and consequences. We can always ask, what kind 
            of language game is this? Where does the power lie? How does it configure 
            the geometry of one’s attention? Needless to say I like language games 
            whose principles of action open possibilities to both chance and intentionality 
            within trajectories of thinking and questioning that can extend over 
            time into projects. The intentional trajectory can describe the arc 
            of the questioning in a way that creates a limit against which you can 
            notice new results or new possibilities. But another language game may 
            turn that trajectory into a circle that excludes anything surprising 
            from coming in. The best intentions are those of letting chance enter 
            in textually.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            And this “letting chance enter textually” might involve a kind of performance 
            on the page? I was thinking about performance work by women artists 
            in the 70s and wondering what your relationship to them was? Was the 
            way in which many of them were exploring notions of process in relation 
            to the body of interest to you?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            No. In the 70s I was interested in performance but it had much more 
            to do with the visual presence of words, and voice. In the 60s I wrote 
            a concrete novel that I thought of as performing on the page. In the 
            70s I wrote a series of what I thought of as utopian radio plays for 
            voices. They were too removed from what was being done on the radio 
            to be broadcast. During the Vietnam War I was part of a guerilla theatre 
            group. I wrote politically satirical plays, but the tactics of guerilla 
            theatre made me very uncomfortable-rather assaultive interventions on 
            the street to make political points. I didn’t want to intrude on people’s 
            physical space in that way and so I didn’t continue with that. The use 
            of the body as blunt instrument has never interested me much.</font></p>

            I think the question you raised earlier, which perhaps you have politely 
            let fade away, is a really important one. I mean if you care about a 
            particular political, social, or ethical dimension then what does it 
            mean to be doing work that exists in rather an exotic form that most 
            people don’t have access to? I tend to think the primary reason they 
            don’t find it accessible is the training they’ve received, the pedagogy, 
            and that training for instance in how to read need not be so restrictive 
            that it makes people fear anything they can’t immediately make sense 
            of. This is how the unintelligible becomes the ground of political bashing—what

            where you are with it and that doesn’t leave room for a space of not 
            knowing or a space of unintelligibility or illegibility that I think 
            is present in your work.</font></p>

            </b>I’m interested in what you’re calling the space of unintelligibility. 
            Again, because I think we are in contact with that space everyday of 
            our lives. If we’re afraid of that space then we retract, we retreat 
            and we are less able to follow our curiosity, to do the kinds of things 
            that make us happy and spirited and engaged as human beings with one 
            another and with complexity. I’m not pretending that if someone is able 
            to come happily into the unintelligible spaces of my work that they 
            are then going to go happily into the unintelligible spaces of the world. 
            Though I do think that cultural processes and pedagogies that allay 
            the fear of confronting unintelligibility in an aesthetic space can 
            engender greater moral courage in general. </font></p>

            You’ve also cited Helen Frankenthaler as being important to you, because 
            she made you notice the edge of things and I wonder if you could say 
            a little more about how this interest in edges gets translated into 
            language?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Yes, that did come first visually. When we talk about the edge in any 
            way other than visual it’s a kind of metaphor. Edge, though, as a term, 
            as a cultural analytic term, is for me and others becoming very problematic. 
            If you think of yourself as operating at the edge then you’re positing 
            a centre.</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            It is interesting how these terms are ones which translate very much 
            into a visual discussion of the page and I’m just wondering if you throw 
            out the question of being interested in margins and in edges what that 
            means in terms of the setting out of pages?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well, pages do have edges, pages do have margins, the world doesn’t...so 
            working with the space on the page is of primary interest. I would hesitate, 
            no, I actually feel it’s a mistake to think that in arranging things 
            in relation to the transgressing of edges, margins, we do have an analogue 
            to how we operate in the world. I think the interesting way in which 
            you don’t have an analogue is that the surface of the space we’re really 
            operating in is more like neural networks. Things are always coming 
            from all directions. To identify the centre, the margin the edge, is 
            to put on a restrictive overlay that has very specific consequences. 
            But of course the fact is that overlays are put on and we’re told that 
            we should operate within them. </font></p>

            </b>But isn’t there a sense in which these restrictive overlays could 
            almost be a parallel to those constraints of process that you’re already

          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Right, yes, well exactly. The question then is what sorts of restrictions, 
            boundaries are productive? Which demonstrate their own incompleteness? 
            Which trap you inside them so that any movement becomes entirely predictable, 
            the rhythm the same at beginning and end.</font></p>

            </b>I’ve just been re-reading Kathleen Fraser’s essay, “Translating 
            the Unspeakable” in which she traces a direct lineage from Olson to 
            contemporary women poets such as Susan Howe, Myung Mi Kim and Hannah 
            Weiner who are experimenting visually with the page. Do you see Olson 
            as a direct influence or legitimating work in this way? </font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR: 
            </b>Olson, like Mallarmé and Duncan, choreographed the whole space of 
            the page and that’s interesting. But Olson did it as a projection of 
            how large his identity, his voice, his territory was. His voice carried 
            to the back wall of the auditorium, throughout the universe of Gloucester, 
            all the way to the margins. His voice is always marking its epic territory. 
            Looking through the Maximus poems I always enjoyed them visually but 
            I didn’t enjoy them as much as text. The reasons I might use various 
            parts of the page have nothing to do with “projective” poetics. The 
            fact is that Olson was writing at a time when all sorts of things were 
            breaking out of their old boundaries. This is not to minimize the Maximus 
            [<i>laughter</i>] but I know other women poets were much more influenced 
            by Olson than I was. I was not enthralled by the residue of the heroic 
            genius in his voice. Cage’s poetic work was all over the page too in 
            <i>Silence </i>and that to me was far more of an influence. “Lecture 
            on Nothing” gave me more interesting permission than anything in Olson.</font></p>

            Well, that’s a sort of tricky question because when I really began my 
            most public practice as a poet I was doing it as part of a group including 
            a number of people whom Silliman included in <i>In The American Tree</i>. 
            Tina Darragh, Peter Inman, Lynne Dreyer, Diane Ward, and even Bruce 
            Andrews—who occasionally came down from NYC to Washington D.C.—we all 
            met regularly to read work in progress. So I was part of this group. 
            There’s a whole genealogy of Language work that took place in the Washington 
            D.C. area that isn’t very much known. </font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>RO:</b> 
            Why do you think that is?</font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            Well, that’s partly because there wasn’t a Language poetry patriarch 
            there. Think of it, the high-profile “language” sites—New York and the 
            Bay area had male impresarios—Charles Bernstein, Bruce Andrews in NY; 
            Ron Silliman, Bob Perelman, Barrett Watten in the Bay area. Ann Vickery 
            is addressing the partiality of the history of “language” now and is 
            including for the first time an account of the D.C. scene.  Ron Silliman 
            asked me for work for In <i>The American Tree</i>, then turned it down. 
            He wrote to say he disagreed with the aesthetic. As editor-arbiter he 
            was making choices of the sort that were entirely his right to do. Ultimately, 
            how one’s work is classified is not of one’s own choosing. It has to 
            do with others’ perceptions of it. </font></p>

            I was going to ask more about the essay “Taking Chances” which you preface 
            with a quote from David Ruelle, which highlights chance as an alternative 
            to the tradition of  “idealizing the world around us in physical theories” 
            and I was wondering if you thought of your work as trying to break with 
            this kind of idealization? </font></p>
          <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>JR:</b> 
            We are living in a world in which things are happening all the time 
            by chance. Chance has as much to do with any patterns that emerge as 
            intention, if not more-historically, for instance. I think contemporary 
            scientific models that foreground the dynamic relationship between order 
            and disorder are much more interesting than the old idealizations that 
            left chance entirely out of the mix.  One of the things that Ruelle 
            says is that early on in the history of science if you got complexity 
            in the results of an experiment you would assume you had made a mistake. 
            The results had to be thrown out. You had to reconcile the experimental 
            design so that nothing too unpredictable or complex came up. This meant 
            that the way we experience the world in everyday life—full of turbulent, 
            unpredictable weather and human behavior-was considered too messy to 
            bother with. </font></p>

            </b>I want to go back to the use of the process in relation to the subject 
            in your work. The space of the “I” of subjectivity seems to be a real 
            site of struggle in your work because of this cross over between the 
            more impersonal “procedures” in the poems and the personal intuitive 
            work that is done alongside these processes. I was wondering if the 
            throwing out of terms like “genius,” “inspiration” was important to 
            you as a woman artist or if it just happened to coincide with a parallel 
            but quite different formal agenda?</font></p>

            </b>That’s an astute observation because I think, yes, being a woman 
            it was very hard not to notice that all the geniuses happened to be 
            men, or a few women with a “man’s mind.” The construction of the notion 
            of genius is a masculine construction. It’s one of large-scale power 
            and authority associated with a particular kind of charisma—a visceral 
            connection between you and those smaller-scale beings drawn towards 
            you to find meaning and direction. It’s an eruptive notion as well, 
            dare I say ejaculatory? [<i>laughter</i>] Spillover of the uncontainable

            </b>I don’t experience the “I” in that way. I don’t experience my energy 
            in that way. I experience my energy as exchange, like the exchange we 
            are having right now in conversation. There’s just nothing I imagine 
            I’d gain by focusing on a kind of contained “I”-ness in which I primarily 
            look inward to draw energy. I think the writing process is a process 
            of breathing/reading in the air--the cultural air. It’s not that I consider 
            a lack of “I”-focus impersonal, it’s very personal in the sense of being 
            charged with what one cares about, what’s most vitally at stake. So 
            I think everything I do can be identified with highly charged values 
            of culture and community and conversation which are much more important 
            to me than some other way of outlining an “I”-space, say autobiographically. 
            It’s not that autobiographical things don’t enter, they of course do. 
            But I find that deriving the direction of one’s work from a monological 
            ‘I’ drains energy. Given all the rich alternatives, it seems a truly 
            bizarre—actually self-depriving—choice. I know it’s done all the time.
