          <i>A poetics of encounter</i></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Poetics 
          is not personal. A poetics gets formed in and as a relationship with the 
          world. These are the opening sentences of one of Lyn Hejinian’s most recent 
          expository formulations of her <i>poesis</i>, and ways in which one might 
          articulate and test the work of poetry — its ethical and political dimensions, 
          its potential as a zone in which the matter of <i>being</i> might begin 
          to be discovered and addressed. On April 9 1999, during a conference held 
          at Barnard College in New York City, Lyn Hejinian delivered a paper entitled 
          “Some Notes toward a Poetics” to an audience of several hundred people. 
          Hejinian was one of eight poets who engaged in a lengthy round-table discussion 
          of contemporary American poetics and cultural production, under the rubric 
          of meeting and innovation.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> 
          Folded in beside numerous poetry readings and “critical” papers, this 
          plenary event staged an exemplary moment of community practice.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          want to read Hejinian’s paper as a poethical condensate, and as a departure 
          node from which to set moving a linked series of terms — encounter, communality, 
          happening, acknowledgment, affirmation, strangeness — with the hope of 
          illuminating their significance for Hejinian’s current praxis.<a href="#_edn5"
  name="_ednref5" title=""><span>[5]</span></a> <i>Encounter</i> has been a favourite 
          trope of Lyn Hejinian’s thinking during the past decade. And in a more 
          rhizomic sense, it is appropriate to Hejinian’s “entire” (or so-far) assembled 
          and evolving body of work. The word “encounter” will circulate in this 
          chapter as a kind of Deleuzean refrain; an “aggregate of matters of expression,” 
          or a repeating syntactical hyphen performing “the link between truly active 
          moments” in Hejinian’s ongoing ethical poetical inquiry.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span>[6]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the second 
          section of ‘Some Notes toward a Poetics,’ Hejinian writes:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Aesthetic 
            discovery can be congruent with social discovery. Aesthetic discovery 
            occurs through encounters, at points of contact, and so too does political 
            and ethical discovery.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
            points of contact or linkages are the manifestation of our logics — 
            they give evidence of our reasoning and they also serve as the sites 
            for our reasons — our reasons to do what we do. (1)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
          encounter is to meet, possibly by chance, and to be literally up against 
          (<i>encontre)</i>. Hejinian’s phrase “points of contact” foregrounds spatiality 
          and mutuality. Something occurs or happens to produce a moment of reciprocal 
          contextualization, an event of inter-subjective (and intra-objective) 
          bordering. Imagined differently, this coming-into-context creates, and 
          becomes, what happens; it <i>is</i> a happening.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          term “encounter” inhabits a border to excess. It glances continually between 
          abstract nomination (<i>an</i> encounter) and a process of acting or becoming 
          (<i>to</i> encounter), between noun and verb. In Hejinian’s epistemolexical 
          scheme, it might be understood as a boundary guard.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"
  title=""><span>[7]</span></a> Grammatical inflections perform a specific kind 
          of work here, and suggest thought horizons well beyond a much-tested ground 
          of referential motility. Emphasising flux, they remind us that encounter-discoveries 
          such as those specified by Hejinian — aesthetic, political, ethical — 
          are always mobile, and open to further meetings or happenings. Jean-Luc 
          Nancy, whose words form part of the epigraph above, cogently describes 
          a related concept in an essay called “Finite History.” “[E]verything,” 
          he writes, is “always inscribed by change and becoming, always carrying 
          the many marks of this inscription.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span>[8]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bringing 
          Jean-Luc Nancy’s ideas and Lyn Hejinian’s writings into a space of meeting 
          provokes a resonant and extremely productive dialogue. Both Nancy and 
          Hejinian are concerned with the <i>how</i> of being, a core matter of 
          ethical thinking; and with matters of commonality, or to use Nancy’s phrase, 
          with situations and conditions of “being in common.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span>[9]</span></a>  
          Both thinkers situate their ethical inquiries alongside and within appraisals 
          of <i>worldliness</i> — Hejinian examines the “in and as” attributes of 
          our “relationship with the world,” while Nancy advances a thesis about 
          “being-toward-the-world.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span>[10]</span></a> 
          I want to consider several questions that appear in a ghostly middle ground, 
          or at a border crossing, between the inquiries of Nancy and Hejinian. 
          What does it mean, following Nancy, to be always in-becoming, and how 
          does Hejinian’s work face or generate that concept? Circumscribed by continual 
          change or moment-to-moment negotiation, what might a <i>poetics of encounter</i> 
          look like, and what might it offer for an encounter with ethics?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          extending these trajectories of thought to include Hejinian’s formal poetic 
          methods, we might discover a different set of related queries. Why are 
          Hejinian’s serialized poetic forms so crucial to her contextually-aware 
          poetical ethic, and to her concepts and experiences of communality? By 
          performing and acknowledging a linked sequence of encounters, in response 
          to continual fluctuations in context, how might serial poems allow a perceiving 
          subject to continually scrutinize and re-assess her own assumptions and 
          placements, with regard to changing certainties about <i>what is happening</i>, 
          or the matter of being in the world?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          have no other experience of living than encounters, suggests Hejinian 
          in “Some Notes toward a Poetics.” “Points of contact or linkages” are 
          the sites of encounter; and in complement, an encounter brings a linkage 
          into being, while existing as a temporary moment of placement on a shifting 
          plane. Imagined further, each encounter is an instance of mutual contextualization, 
          and might thus be interpreted <i>as</i> a literal and reciprocal nexus 
          with an other being. Perhaps, following Nancy’s explorations in a work 
          entitled <i>Being Singular Plural</i>, encounters might be readily observable 
          moments of being with-one-another (<i>etant l’un-avec-l’autre</i>) or 
          being in co-existence.<a
  href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span>[11]</span></a> To Lyn Hejinian’s 
          way of thinking, encounters consequently offer the most pleasurably rich 
          and incontrovertible scope for an ethical poetry, and for a poetry that 
          acknowledges and finds its community. Within an ontology of linkages, 
          described by Nancy as a co-ontology, a ground <i>between </i>subjects 
          — interrelationship itself — becomes a preeminent concern. And within 
          our meetings and links, Hejinian writes, we might discover and make manifest 
          “our reasons to do what we do,” our ethical codes and occupations.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          want the term “occupations” here to embrace and suggest both labour practices 
          or ways of working — what is “done,” and our <i>doing</i> — and places 
          of habitation or occupied spaces. Both are integral aspects of our ways 
          of <i>being</i> in the world. Hejinian is concerned likewise with processes, 
          rather than static occurrences or things; for in encounters, we discover 
          not only our reasons, but “evidence of our reasoning.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"
  title=""><span>[12]</span></a> We discover our methods for choosing how to respond 
          to experience, and to our consciousness of experience.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Poetical 
          work is included implicitly in Hejinian’s sense of reason: “we have no 
          other use for language than to have [encounters].” With this observation, 
          Hejinian maps an ethical terrain that is dependent upon poetic inquiry 
          as a mode of precipitating and acknowledging events of co-incidence. Poetic 
          language, a language of investigation and (at)testing, might potentially 
          uncover the substance of an ethos of commonality. Hejinian is not suggesting 
          that poetry be regarded as the single vehicle for such discoveries. She 
          makes a strong and optimistic case, however, for poetic language as a 
          powerfully useful (and perhaps singular) tract of ethical inquiry, and 
          even as an engagement of moral necessity. One of Hejinian’s most frequently 
          quoted aphorisms, eponymous to a recently published and inaugural book 
          of her essays, gives a clue to the task: “the language of poetry is a 
          language of inquiry.”<a href="#_edn13"
  name="_ednref13" title=""><span>[13]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Responsivity 
          to encounters — or, put differently, to moments of <i>communality </i>— 
          is integral to Hejinian’s understanding of the “experience of living,” 
          and close to her sense of poetry’s responsibility. For Hejinian, the discovery 
          and acknowledgment of communality, a way of “being-with” a world of things 
          as they happen, is the poethical experiment that <i>must be done</i>.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span>[14]</span></a> 
          And from this nexus of thought, a more general <i>raison d’etre</i> might 
          be extrapolated: community is Lyn Hejinian’s reason to do what she does.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span>[15]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          have borrowed the neologism “poethical” from Joan Retallack’s excellent 
          essay entitled “The Poethical Wager.” While source-claims and lineation 
          narratives are frequently made subject to intense scrutiny in contemporary 
          critical discourse, and rightly so, I think it is important to attribute 
          this term to Retallack, in context of much contemporary thinking about 
          poetics that has emerged within the critically prolific field of American 
          innovative poetry over the past decade. Retallack questions the relevance 
          and ethical bearing of experimental poetry, understood as a practice of 
          labour. She writes: “It strikes me that since the work of any given generation 
          is adding to the initial conditions of the generations to come, one obviously 
          tries to add positive, even constructive, initial conditions... The poethical 
          wager… is just that we do our utmost on the chance that our work will 
          be as helpful as any other infinitesimal initial condition might be.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span>[16]</span></a> 
          Retallack qualifies her open wager with a sentence quoted from experimental 
          musician John Cage: “One does not then just make any experiment, but does 
          what must be done.”(302)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lyn 
          Hejinian’s long poem <i>Happily</i> can be read as a sustained inquiry 
          into “what must be done,” or what we are bound to encounter, within spheres 
          traced out by poetical thinking. It was written during 1998 and early 
          1999, contemporaneously with “Some Notes toward a Poetics,” and published 
          by the Post-Apollo Press in 2000.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span>[17]</span></a> 
          Early in the poem, Hejinian meditates on the purpose of poetry and its 
          relation to occurrences:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Perhaps 
            it is the role of art to provide us with this chance that is<br>
            Perhaps it is the role of art to put us in complicity with things<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they 
            happen  (<i>Happily </i>13)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hejinian’s 
          anaphoristic use of the word “perhaps” gently reminds us that her poethics 
          is offered, rather than prescribed. Perhaps it is the role of art to put 
          us in complicity with what <i>might</i> be done, or what may be. The phrase 
          “to put us in complicity” suggests another figure for commonality, for 
          a mode and moment of being — “this chance” — that is both profoundly and 
          self-consciously communal.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">During 
          the 2000 Modernist Studies Association conference, held at the University 
          of Pennsylvania, Hejinian participated in a reading series entitled “Nine 
          contemporary poets read themselves through modernism,” orchestrated by 
          Bob Perelman and Al Filreis. On the evening of October 12, at the Kelly 
          Writers’ House, Hejinian presented a paper that performed a brief exegesis 
          of two of her poems — <i>My Life</i> and <i>Happily </i>— gathered in 
          company with various writings by Gertrude Stein.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span>[18]</span></a> 
          While the event itself hints at Hejinian’s dedication to certain “material” 
          communities, I am most concerned here with Hejinian’s choice to reaffirm 
          her interest in a poetic grounded in encounters, in the acknowledgment 
          of things <i>as they happen</i>, or appear to happen, in the world. Hejinian 
          stated:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Things 
            have presence because they occur <i>in</i> and <i>as</i> motion. They 
            exist by virtue of motion’s “in and as” character. And our role among 
            them is participatory, shared, in and as. This is what is known as the 
            routine, all that is presently <i>in</i> the way and <i>on</i> the way, 
            and even, at the risk of sounding Heideggerean, <i>as</i> the way... 
            The routine is the social motion of worldliness, political in my view 
            because it entails our being with our doing, and our doing with our 
            being.<a
  href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span>[19]</span></a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Participatory, 
          shared, <i>in</i> and <i>as</i>, our role among things. All of these are 
          carefully-chosen terms from a poethical lexicon that cares deeply about 
          purpose and futurity, and for a life lived in context of other people, 
          ideas and things; for a life <i>with</i>, in the fullest sense of that 
          word. Hejinian concerns herself not only with what must be done, but <i>why</i> 
          the doing matters, and how the doing becomes a matter of being.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          issues will be explored a little later. I want to return now to a dialogue 
          between Hejinian’s poetical writings and the ideas of Jean-Luc Nancy. 
          Here again are the lines with which this chapter began: “We have to decide 
          to — and decide how to — be <i>in</i> common, to allow our existence to 
          exist. This is not only at each moment a political decision; it is a decision 
          about politics, about if and how we allow our otherness to exist, to inscribe 
          itself as community and history.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nancy’s 
          words imply a condition of ethical agency, within which matters of co-existence 
          might be chosen, articulated and tested. The notion of <i>being-in-common</i>, 
          a phrase used frequently in “Finite History” to designate community, sits 
          extremely well beside Hejinian’s explorations of encounter. Nancy reads 
          community as an event, the occurrence of togetherness:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Community] 
            is not a substance, nor a subject; it is not a common being, which could 
            be the goal or culmination of a progressive process. It is rather a 
            being-<i>in</i>-common which only <i>happens</i>, or which is happening, 
            an event, more than a “<i>being</i>.” (149)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          rejecting <i>a</i> common being as a figure for community and referring 
          instead to being-<i>in</i>-common, Nancy draws attention toward existential 
          proximity as a process, “a happening as it comes.”(166) Hejinian’s ideas 
          are comparable: community is an event of shared context, of the “active 
          correlations (co-relations)” occasioned by encounters.<a
  href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span>[20]</span></a> For Hejinian, as 
          for Nancy, community is on-going, rather than a finishing point or tangible 
          subject. In keeping with Hejinian’s contextually-mindful poetic, I use 
          the phrase “existential proximity” to try and move beyond concepts of 
          proximity that are gauged primarily or wholly in reference to spatial 
          and temporal elements. Existential proximity might include, for example, 
          discursive frameworks and modes of ideation. The phrase “shared context,” 
          which first appears in a 1998 essay by Hejinian entitled “Reason,” invites 
          similarly inclusive speculations.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lyn 
          Hejinian’s poetical work can be imagined, in one reading, as an augmentative 
          writing-through of Jean-Luc Nancy’s thoughts about community as outlined 
          in “Finite History.” Nancy offers “a way of thinking”(169) about being-in-common 
          (“this is not a theory”). Hejinian makes explicit excursions into the 
          <i>how</i> of commonality, producing and acknowledging in poetry the activity 
          of interrelatedness. <i>Happily</i> performs a linked series of encounters 
          among things, ideas, commonplace events and manners of regard. Each line 
          of the poem brings subject- and object-worlds into shared proximity, by 
          staging interactions among three principal elements: a world that is being 
          perceived, perceptual inventions and processes, and language, which constitutes 
          one boundary (or medium of proliferating connections) between the world 
          as it “happens” and our perceptions within that world, or our sense of 
          the world.<a href="#_edn21"
  name="_ednref21" title=""><span>[21]</span></a> The writing <i>is</i> the encounter 
          — the happening — as much as it responds to what has happened, or what 
          might.<i> Constantly I write this happily...</i> the deictic in Hejinian’s 
          equivocal (or perhaps polyvalent) opening words encompasses a field of 
          philosophical inquiry, “things” as they happen, a being-in-writing, and 
          the poem itself. Each is proximate to the others. The poem accumulates 
          its observations and allows them to co-exist, rather than asserting “the 
          goal or culmination” of progressive ontological processes. This is not 
          a theory.</font></p>

          using the term “writing-though,” I am not intending to sketch or reiterate 
          lineations which give prior standing to a piece of writing — Nancy’s — 
          that can be generically over-determined as “philosophical,” or to create 
          (chronological) textual hierarchies that afford originary status to particular 
          concepts. I don’t mean to suggest, either, that Hejinian has read and 
          worked from “Finite History”; for although Hejinian mentions Nancy’s long 
          work <i>The Inoperative Community</i> in her poetical essay entitled “Reason,” 
          and has certainly read from several other philosophical texts referred 
          to in “Finite History,” her use of Nancy’s thinking is never made explicit.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22"

          between texts, and to enact Lyn Hejinian’s trope of encounter in “critical” 
          terms by helping these writings to face each other, and tracing something 
          of my own meeting with them. This process might be thought of as a moment 
          of becoming-in-common with the texts, an event of co-incidence. Perhaps 
          critical work is best understood in this way; as part of the work of acknowledgment, 
          one porous response to what has been already generated and offered.</font></p>

          most contemporary readings of poetical encounter — the <i>guest-host relationship</i>, 
          as presented in “Some Notes toward a Poetics” — with the idea of community 
          as an event that can constitute and enable radical, reciprocal affirmations 
          of “being” involving embodiments of extra-subjective, and strangely-political, 
          otherness. Much of this thinking echoes and moves outward from a declaration 
          made by Hejinian, quoted above and returned to here: a poetics gets formed 
          in and as a relationship with the world.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Jean-Luc 
          Nancy writes in “Finite History” that each event or occurrence of being-in-common 
          opens up “a world, if ‘world’ does not mean universe or cosmos, but the 
          proper place of existence as such, the place in which one is ‘given to 
          the world’ or where one ‘comes into the world.’ A world is neither space 
          nor time; it is <i>the way we exist together</i>”(168, my emphasis). For 
          Nancy, worlds are not tropes of in-different universality, or non-heterogeneity. 
          Rather, they appear as assemblages of discrete though linked instances 
          of togetherness. They figure a process of coming-into-communality, in 
          a “proper place of existence” exceeding purely spatio-temporal referents 
          and adjacencies. The meaning of being-in-the-world, as Nancy writes in 
          <i>Being Singular Plural</i>, is always already a common meaning; in fact 
          “there is no meaning if meaning is not shared,” since “meaning is itself 
          the sharing of Being.”<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span>[25]</span></a> 
          A world is a set of connections, a way of existing (or more accurately, 
          being-together) that is in process, or in-becoming. It <i>arrives</i> 
          or <i>appears</i> or <i>happens</i>, rather than operating as a monolithic 
          “thing.” In <i>The Differend: Phrases in Dispute</i>, a text dealing specifically 
          with discursive paradigms or “phrase regimens” and the “linkages” that 
          happen between them, Jean-François Lyotard explores a related idea: “the 
          referent <i>world</i> is not an object of cognition, it eludes the test 
          of reality... By <i>world</i>, I understand a network of proper names.

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          might understand in a correspondent light Lyn Hejinian’s description of 
          a poetics that happens “as a relationship with the world.” As Hejinian 
          writes in “Some Notes toward a Poetics,” the formulation of a poetics 
          is a profoundly sociable act — an arrival into, and a testing of, the 
          limits and meanings of context and community:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Poetics 
            is where poetry’s engagement with meaning as meaningfulness gets elaborated 
            — poetics is the site of poetry’s reason — where the plurality of its 
            logics and the viability of its contexts are tested and articulated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A poetics 
            considers how and what a specific poem means within itself and its own 
            terms and how and why it means (and is meaningful) within a community 
            that congregates around it. (1)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
          Hejinian, poetics performs the labour of critique and a critique of labour 
          practices, interrogating worlds in which one’s poetical work might operate. 
          A poetics elucidates <i>poetry’s reason </i>— its capacity to mean, to 
          articulate, and to account for its own positioning within what “congregates” 
          or happens around it. Poetics is a mode of mobile vigilance, in which 
          a writer can admit — or perhaps advance toward — fulsome, contextual reflexivity, 
          and a sense of being <i>in</i> the world rather than at an observational 
          or unworldly distance <i>from</i> it. In a different sense, Hejinian’s 
          poetics can be imagined as a testing site for a series of simply complex 
          dilemmas, often navigated by Hejinian on a cusp between political and 
          cultural (or worldly) efficacy, and “personal” compulsion or necessity: 
          Does it <i>matter</i> to write? Does poetry need a reason? What is happening, 
          and how might poetry observe it?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          Hejinian’s measure, poetry has a responsibility toward encountering the 
          world, or to cite Nancy, “the way we exist together.”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27"
  title=""><span>[27]</span></a> In doing so, it becomes an affirmative praxis; 
          principally because of its quotidian capacities to respond to the fact 
          that things occur, that “events are unscrolling, they cover [our] eyes”(<i>Happily</i> 
          19). Imagined further, poetry is a language-ing art of acknowledgment, 
          unparalleled in its ability to state that “this is happening”(<i>Happily</i> 
          1).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“It 
          is not possible,” writes Nancy in <i>The Sense of the World</i>, “...to 
          give up thinking that something is <i>happening</i>, that something here 
          called ‘world’ is happening to us, and that it is here and now that this 
          is coming to pass and that the here and now takes place in accordance 
          with what it transmits to itself of what it represents as being where 
          it comes from.”<a href="#_edn28"
  name="_ednref28" title=""><span>[28]</span></a> When “a world” is noticed in poetry, 
          or when moments of co-incidence between beings and things are recognized 
          and generated, a manifold <i>affirmation</i> takes place. Occurrences, 
          perceived perhaps as objects, are acknowledged and given (epi)phenomenal 
          presence “in accordance with where they come from” (<i>this is happening</i>); 
          while simultaneously, subjects themselves, along with modes of togetherness 
          (Nancy) in a world of commonplace events, are given meaning and form (<i>this 
          is happening and can be perceived, and is our context for perceiving</i>). 
          Poetry’s fluid and transmutable potential for affirmation — for making 
          a record of appearances — is pivotal to why it “matters” for Lyn Hejinian 
          to write. And the development of something called “a poetics” provides 
          Hejinian with an extra, philosophical chance to address seriously the 
          issue of poetry’s reasoning, and its mattering within the world.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is worth noting a further parallel between Hejinian’s poetic of appearances 
          and encounters, encoded in <i>Happily</i> by meditations upon the phrase 
          “this is happening,” and certain threads of inquiry pursued in Jean-François 
          Lyotard’s <i>The Differend</i>. Hejinian quotes Lyotard in “Reason,” an 
          essay first published in 1998 in the inaugural issue of <i>Shark</i> — 
          a journal of art, poetics and criticism edited by (and eponymous to) Emilie 
          Clark and Lytle Shaw.<a href="#_edn29"
  name="_ednref29" title=""><span>[29]</span></a> While advancing a thesis in “Reason” 
          about poetry’s capacities for contextual reflexivity, Hejinian makes a 
          qualified claim in a footnote to sharing “some of the same goals” as <i>The 
          Differend</i>, regarding explorations of links between discursive praxis, 
          ideation and experience.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span>[30]</span></a> 
          She is not specific about those goals or moments of convergence. In <i>The 
          Differend</i>, Lyotard writes: “Reflection requires that you watch out 
          for occurrences, that you don’t already know what’s happening. It leaves 
          open the question: <i>Is it happening?</i>”(xv) He later observes:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In sum, 
            there are events: something happens which is not tautological with what 
            has happened. Would you call what happens <i>the case</i>? – The case, 
            <i>der Fall</i>, would be that something happens, <i>quod</i>, rather 
            than what happens, <i>quid</i>. – Would you say that “the world is all 
            that [which] is the case,” as Wittgenstein does? – We could if we could 
            distinguished between <i>the case</i> and <i>that which is the </i>case... 
            The case is: <i>There is, It happens</i>. That is to say: <i>Is it happening?</i> 
            (79, interpolation included)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Watching 
          out for occurrences” and affirming them in language could stand comfortably 
          as a description of Hejinian’s core task in <i>Happily</i>. Hejinian situates 
          her poetry within appreciations of worldliness, and wonders in doing so, 
          as Lyotard does, whether there are considerable distances between material 
          and commonplace realities — actual things or “events,” or “all that is 
          the case” — and our sense of the world, or our perception of what is happening; 
          especially, our sense of relationships and interactions between things. 
          How might the <i>event</i> of acknowledgment itself differ radically from 
          <i>events</i> (or appearances) that are happening, or that we are acknowledging? 
          What differences exist between “things” that occur and our perception 
          that things are occurring, or in Lyotard’s distinction, between <i>that</i> 
          and <i>what</i>? Does the world need notice in order to attain “reality,” 
          and do things matter, and have material substance, without being perceived? 
          What relations between subject and object are obvious and/or newly possible 
          within poetical acknowledging?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          are well-enumerated dilemmas, perhaps; but they are justly relevant to 
          a poetry that is self-conscious about links between appearances, perception, 
          ideation and language. Lyotard’s mediations on <i>that</i>, <i>what</i> 
          and <i>worldliness</i> are audible in the following passage from <i>Happily</i>, 
          in which Hejinian reflects upon the work of acknowledgment performed by 
          poetry, and the difficult “realism” that poetic language might ascribe 
          to occurrences:</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          phrase “if you can keep up” is reminiscent of Hejinian’s opening words 
          to the preface of <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i>, a long poem published 
          twenty-two years prior to <i>Happily</i>: “I am always conscious of the 
          disquieting runs of life slipping by.”<a href="#_edn31"
  name="_ednref31" title=""><span>[31]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">During 
          her recent reading at the 2000 Modernist Studies Association conference 
          of her own poetry’s Steinian attentiveness to the runs of life slipping 
          by (“consecutive events ploughing through the space surrounding them to 
          something now”), Lyn Hejinian addressed an interface between occurrences 
          — things that appear — and our sense of those occurrences, or our comprehension 
          of “being real.” A poetics of encounter is really a poetics in which appearances 
          are met <i>in language</i>, and in consciousness. “I see appearances,” 
          stated Hejinian. “I am attracted to, and engaged with, what comes into 
          view. Things have presence because they occur in and as motion... <i>And 
          to acknowledge it is to acknowledge that the world exists, things are 
          happening, and it matters</i>. How and why things matter, how they materialize, 
          how they appear, is contingent but intrinsic... What matters appears, 
          and what appears matters.”<a
  href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span>[32]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Poetry 
          sees appearances, and via the “contingent but intrinsic” medium of language, 
          affirms the presence of things as they happen “into view” or into thought’s 
          terrain. In this, poetry cares about worldliness; about life as it is 
          lived. “It is the task of poetry,” writes Hejinian in “Reason,” “to produce 
          the phrase <i>this is happening</i> and thereby to provoke the sensation 
          that corresponds to it — a sensation of newness, yes, and of renewedness 
          — an experience of the revitalization of things in the world, an acknowledgment 
          of the liveliness of the world... a sense of living our life”<i>(</i>4). 
          I will return to this statement shortly, since it requires (and is given 
          by Hejinian) a substantial qualification, regarding the ethical relevance 
          of context to a poetry about <i>this</i>-ness or experience. As Hejinian 
          writes in <i>Happily</i>, “consecutive events” come to our present notice 
          “ploughing through the space surrounding them.”(22) Our sense of the appearance 
          of “something now” is dependent, in other words, upon context and motion.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
          far in this chapter, I have argued that by acknowledging in language a 
          world of occurrences and things, and by allowing them to exist in a “co-ontology,” 
          or as discrete materials that co-incide while retaining their singularities, 
          Lyn Hejinian’s serialized work — exemplified in the long poem <i>Happily</i> 
          — generates a way of thinking about commonality that resonates exactly 
          with Jean-Luc Nancy’s ideas of community as an ever-mobile happening, 
          an event of being-in-common that is in constant arrival. I have suggested 
          that Hejinian is highly concerned with modes of <i>worldly</i> poetic 
          practice, that affirm things in their worldliness, as they appear or are

          At this point it is necessary to provide further texture for a concept 
          of community that is grounded in observable, co-inciding actualities and 
          affirmations of matter, as embraced by the disarmingly simple phrase “this 
          is happening.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          mere existence of a prolific array of “things” in poetry, regardless of 
          their intentions or positionalities within a subjective observational 
          milieu, will not necessarily guarantee Jean-Luc Nancy’s notion of being-in-common. 
          Nor will it inevitably speak — without qualification — of an ethics. “Co-incidence,” 
          as observed by a sentient being, would seem inadequate as a foundation 
          for community; or at least, assertions which make a <i>prima facie</i> 
          connection between the phrase “this is happening” and a mode of worldly 
          commonality require extra evidence, or further scrutiny. They are adequate 
          as starting points, but linkages are required; and in them, argues Hejinian, 
          our strongest ethical and communal traces and reasons will be found.<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34"
  title=""><span>[34]</span></a> How might we make better sense of “being-with” 
          and “being-toward-the-world”(Nancy) in order to strengthen an appraisal 
          of <i>community</i> as it relates to perceptions of co-inciding matter? 
          Do concepts of community require a dimension of continuity, and where 
          might that be located? Within Lyn Hejinian’s poetical vocabulary, answers 
          to these questions move between two lexical flight-lines, both used to 
          signal similar things: <i>context</i> and <i>active correlation</i>.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          focussed earlier on dynamic characteristics of the word “encounter” in 
          order to emphasise inter-action as a crucial aspect of Hejinian’s poetic, 
          writing: “within an ontology about linkages, described by Nancy as a co-ontology, 
          a ground <i>between </i>subjects — the fact of interrelationship itself 
          — becomes a preeminent concern.” Jean-Luc Nancy’s interpretation of community 
          as an event of being-in-common, the “happening as it comes” of a <i>we</i>, 
          suggests that our primary mode of being (or our way of meaning a life)<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span>[36]</span></a> 
          depends upon interactivity. “The happening consists in bringing forth 
          a certain spacing of time, where something takes place,” writes Nancy. 
          “In order to say ‘we,’ we have to be in a certain common space of time...community 
          itself is this space.”<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37"
  title=""><span>[37]</span></a> Community, <i>commonality</i>, is “not the anonymous 
          chatter of the ‘public domain’” or a concept that originates solely with 
          the ubiquitous city-states of early political philosophy.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38"
  title=""><span>[38]</span></a> It is rather a zone or place created <i>by</i> 
          the activity of intersubjective linkages, an occurrence-between — a “spacing 
          of time” — “if one still wants to call this ‘community,’”observes Nancy 
          in a parenthetical aside within <i>Being Singular Plural</i>.(25) Being-in-community 
          finds its continuity in transit, since things are always in changing relation. 
          When Nancy writes of being-toward-the-world, he is referring to the contiguous 
          shifts, reciprocal presencings and transitions that occur among interacting 
          worldly elements; a state, perhaps, of continuous encounter.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nancy’s 
          philosophy of community corresponds well with Hejinian’s interpretation 
          of context, “the medium of our encounter.”<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39"
  title=""><span>[39]</span></a> Where Nancy uses being-in-common as a trope for 
          community, he might equally write, within the turning limits of textual 
          transl(iter)ation, <i>being-in-context</i>. Linkages that occur with encounters 
          are a condition of possibility for the task of “presenting or representing 
          ourselves as a community.”<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span>[40]</span></a> 
          They are the <i>event</i> of community, consistent in their provisionality. 
          “Philosophy needs to think in principle about how we are ‘us’ among us, 
          that is, how the consistency of our Being is in being-in-common, and how 
          this consists precisely in the ‘in’ or in the ‘between’ of its spacing,” 
          suggests Nancy.<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span>[41]</span></a> 
          This “spacing of time” is <i>history</i>, finite in the sense of its moment-to-moment 
          character. Or as Hejinian writes in “Reason,” this spacing of time, our 
          being-in-common, is <i>context</i>:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If one 
            sees history as, at the very least, a set of relations — or, to be more 
            precise, of active correlations (co-relations) — then that seems not 
            too far from a workable characterization of the <i>context</i> of something. 
            And it not only allows one to situate that <i>something</i> within history 
            as a descriptive and explanatory account of what has happened, but it 
            also gives <i>something</i> a history with a future. Context is a past 
            with a future. That is the sense of the phrase <i>this is happening</i>. 
            That is what gives us a sense of <i>reason</i>. (5)</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Within 
          our observations and experiences of co-relation or active co-incidence 
          (our encounters), we might discover reasons. In Nancy’s terms, we might 
          find community within the plural of our singularities. “Among those things,” 
          writes Hejinian in “O’s Affirmation,” while referring to the “separated 
          and abandoned moments” of living, “all our linkages — our ethics — await 
          us. It’s in experiencing change as an exemplary connection that ethics 
          becomes identified with linkage.”(18) Interrelationship is where an ethics 
          might begin. Or to follow Hejinian’s sense of the word, ethics resides 
          <i>in context</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          giving (poetical) priority to context, Hejinian intends to critique an

          She anchors affirmations of co-inciding materialities within appreciations 
          of the transitions that comprise history, or worldliness: “Context is 
          a past with a future” (above). Things happen and are affirmed, but they 
          happen in context, “always situated.”<a href="#_edn43"

          part, <i>Happily</i> actualizes this critique by offering readers a poetic 
          of <i>admission</i> rather than a poetry of <i>confession</i>. Hejinian 
          admits the mess of surrounding history, while refusing to privilege the 
          interiorized and transcendent reflections of a single sentient being (-Poet) 
          — a poetic telos that Hejinian refers to in “Reason” as “anti-intellectual 
          and ultimately philistine,” “romantic” and “boringly persistent”:</font></p>

            There is a danger that one implies that the questioning of experience 
            may serve to distance and thereby diminish at least aspects of it, and 
            that this is antithetical to ‘real’ artistic practice. This is the basis 
            of art’s supposed hostility to criticism, theory (thought), and occasionally 
            hostility even to examination of its own history. Or, to put it another

          being-there — while effecting, via formal seriality, a hyper-attentive

          sentence with which I’ve become obsessed”(3). <i>Along comes something 
          — launched in context</i>. The phrase re-emerges as a headnote to the 
          fifty-seventh section of the serial poem <i>My Life</i> (Hejinian’s ongoing

  name="_ednref45" title=""><span>[45]</span></a> It appears again in “Some Notes 
          toward a Poetics”(2) and as the eighteenth “sentence” of <i>Happily</i>.(5) 
          Fragments of it surface at various subsequent moments of that poem, as 
          Hejinian returns over and over to poethical contemplations of the phrase 
          <i>this is happening</i>: “Context is the chance that time takes.” “Something 
          launched without endpoint.” “From something launched we extract our sentences.” 
          “Launched? Nothing is not so.” “Something comes.” “It is midday a sentence

            of incipience, which occurs with the recognition of the experience of 
            and presented by the phrase <i>along comes something — launched in context</i>

          names the fact of interrelation, the spacing “between” that constitutes 
          Nancy’s sense of <i>community</i> or being-in-common. Context is the world 
          understood as an assemblage of links, always re-connecting. And here, 
          we reach a key tenet of this discussion: via appreciations of context, 
          readers can begin to recognise parity between notions of community in-becoming 
          and a poetry that acknowledges and spatializes occurrences, or affirms 
          “the fact things that are happening,”<a
  href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><span>[47]</span></a> while mapping the 
          transitions and relations <i>between</i>  — as does <i>Happily</i>. Hejinian’s 
          long poetical lines effect a version of Nancy’s “common spacing of time.” 
          They give measure (or time) to “what is taking place,” and in doing so, 
          create and proffer community as it arrives. <i>Happily</i> understands 
          and unrolls time as a discrete series of localized events. Matter is always 
          on-location: “What I feel is taking place, a large context, long yielding,

          numerousness could be interpreted as a relatively opportunistic or rhetorical 
          way to effect “community”; a facile and appropriative, or even colonising, 
          gesture. As Hejinian asserts, an unqualified or “directionless pluralism” 
          that is “lacking participation in the forming of relationships” might 
          pave the way for “a dangerous immanentism,” in which no thing is differentiated

          “metaphysical flimsiness of purely conjunctive relations,” and quotes 
          from James: “Merely to be ‘with’ one another in a universe of discourse

            It is in these transitions that the activity of being is exercised —

          calibration of “the work of being in the world” beside constitutions of 
          community. <i>Happily</i> investigates thingness-in-co-relation; not necessarily 
          the act of perception itself, but the fact of <i>being-with</i> — “a system

          that might operate as a mobile ethical limit to (social and political) 
          possibility. We are responsible for choosing the meaning of being numerous; 
          for spacing time, and making links. Context, <i>history</i> or “critique”

          contextually-grounded differential choices, “validating some, signing 
          on to some, and invalidating others.” It follows that an ethical poetics 
          will take moment-to-moment account of context, as an historicizing and

            concrete surface of the words, staring hard, and then skim back, to 
            remark on shorelines not merely flat. Emerging mindfulness, moving socially

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Containing 
          itself with detail, a paradoxical figure, signals a desire to preserve 
          from effacement the historical conditions in which things happen, moving 
          socially, each to their moment. Contextualizing a rummage of particulars 
          — placing the details — partly explains Hejinian’s career-long choice 
          of lengthy, serialized poetic forms, in which context is literally admitted 
          and measured as it changes. Hejinian’s poems never float as unanchored, 
          one-off meditations or observations. They allow maximal time to take place, 
          a full occurrence of everyday space. “Whatever I see in thought as life 
          I come to coming to me in history”(<i>Happily</i> 19).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“The 
          shake in life” identified by Hejinian (above) might be the uncertainty 
          of limitless possibility, a concept echoed in Jacques Derrida’s text <i>Aporias</i>: 
          “From the very first moment... [a statement] trembles in an unstable multiplicity 
          as long as there is no context to stop us.”<a href="#_edn57"

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hejinian 
          is explicit in “Reason” about ethical affinities between her work and 
          Oppen’s correspondently-serial poetry. She interprets “Of Being Numerous” 
          as “a testing of the same <i>context</i>, the same <i>reason</i>”(5) that 
          dominates her own recent poetical inquiries. Activating co-relations, 
          or choosing certain meetings and boundaries, is the stopping work of context, 
          in which an ethics becomes visible; hovering, perhaps, beside the bright 
          light of shipwreck.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hejinian’s 
          emphasis on each moment as it “contains itself with detail” finds obvious 
          precedent in Gertrude Stein’s sparkling matrices of everyday happenings, 
          that brim with connectivity as they literally take time, or let place 
          occur. “It is a way of letting it be partly hers and theirs and it is 
          also a way of their leaving it one at a time as often as it is of any 
          use to anyone. It is moreover as much as they care to allow them to arrange 
          it…Coming with and an arrangement of their being more than half placed 
          in an allowance of the most elaborate and very careful interchange.”<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title=""><span>[59]</span></a> 
          Stein’s words — “one at a time,” “coming with” in “an arrangement of their 
          being” — echo both Jean-Luc Nancy’s concept of perpetual arrival in <i>being-with</i>, 
          and Lyn Hejinian’s concept of an “emerging mindfulness” that “mov[es] 
          socially alongside” each instant. Moving socially suggests both being-toward-the-world, 
          and a condition of being always already in language.<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title=""><span>[60]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nancy 
          writes that history or context “spaces time itself, spacing it from its 
          <i>continuous present</i>…  A happening happens between present and present, 
          between the flow and itself.”[my emphasis]<a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title=""><span>[61]</span></a> 
          Here we find a thread connecting opposite ends of a century, running between 
          Nancy’s idea of re-arriving community and Stein’s most famed compositional 
          strategy. “Beginning again and again” in order to create “a composition 
          of a prolonged present,” a technique regarded by Stein during the 1920s 
          “more and more complicatedly” as “a continuous present,”<a
  href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title=""><span>[62]</span></a> remains one of 
          Stein’s most lasting gifts to twentieth-century poetic technique. <i>Happily</i> 
          also maps a continuous present, albeit with a late 1990s piquancy — perhaps, 
          as it does, bearing witness to another of Stein’s (more oxymoronic) observations: 
          “Nothing changes from generation to generation except the thing seen and 
          that makes a composition.”<a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title=""><span>[63]</span></a> 
          <i>Happily</i> sees and composes what happens between <i>this</i> and 
          <i>this</i> and <i>this</i>; between present and present, or everything 
          seen to be changing. In concert (or community) with Jean-Luc Nancy, Gertrude 
          Stein and William James, Hejinian records “the transitions between [things] 
          and between them and us” that are the materials — the matter — of consciousness, 
          and therefore, of worldly living. Things have motion <i>in </i>context, 
          and are <i>each other’s</i> context. The world is a composition that materializes, 
          presently, in-between:</font></p>

          where William James once said of Gertrude Stein’s work “this is a fine

          fine new kind of materialism.”<a href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title=""><span>[64]</span></a> 
          To acknowledge appearances as they space the time is to acknowledge that 
          a world exists, writes Hejinian. Things are happening, and it matters.<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title=""><span>[65]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          <i>The Sense of the World</i>, Jean-Luc Nancy meditates upon Martin Heidegger’s 
          notion of <i>Dasein</i>, “the taking-place or the existing… in this world 
          here,”(56)  another kind of presencing:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But — 
            these things: there are things. All these things, all these bodies, 
            their areas, their <i>arealities</i>… In accordance with this existential 
            condition [<i>Dasein</i>], the primary theme of all existence… is, first 
            of all, the spacing/spaced taking-place-there. This existential condition 
            is <i>the worldly</i>. (157-158)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Community 
          — <i>worldliness</i> — is the spacing of what takes place. Nancy’s spatialized 
          (or arealized) “things and bodies” are Hejinian’s contextualized “occurrences 
          and appearances.” There is an uncanny resonance, too, between Nancy’s 
          musings on worldliness and Oppen’s song to ontological materials in the 
          first lines of the poem “Of Being Numerous”: <i>There are things we live 
          among</i>.<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title=""><span>[66]</span></a> 
          The link is Heidegger, whose work Oppen read closely for its considerations 
          of the substance or matter of worldliness. “[A poem] is an instance of 
          ‘being in the world,’” wrote Oppen, at “the limits of judgement, the limits 
          of pure reason —  I said, remember: ‘All this is reportage’  An account 
          of being in the world, to stick to H[eidegger].”<a href="#_edn67"
  name="_ednref67" title=""><span>[67]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
          evinced by Oppen’s phrase “the limits of judgement,” a poetry grounded 
          in worldly affirmations is not a poetry without uncertainty. The twenty-sixth 
          and longest section of “Of Being Numerous” includes this reflection of 
          quiet undecidedness:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We want

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dilemma 
          is also essential to Lyn Hejinian’s worldly and contextually-grounded 
          poetic, and to her sense of non-prescriptive ethical possibilities. “I 
          espouse a poetics of affirmation,” states Hejinian in “Some Notes toward 
          a Poetics.” “I also espouse a poetics of uncertainty, of doubt, difficulty 
          and strangeness”(1). When Hejinian writes in <i>Happily</i> of “being 
          sometimes afraid of the effort required for judgment, afraid of the judgment 
          required,” she signals poetical hazard — a condition of taking one’s chances.(22) 
          Or rather she acknowledges that ethics itself, which requires judgment 
          among the materials of living, is an engagement of on-going dilemma. “What 
          I have learnt from [Oppen’s work],” wrote Hejinian in June 2001, “is the 
          value of uncertainty, the commitment to doubt (and even to ambivalence).”<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" title=""><span>[69]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ethics 
          is a <i>quandary</i> — a word that is listed appropriately in the Oxford 
          Dictionary as being of uncertain etymology. Indeed, as Giorgio Agamben 
          infers, there can be no ethics without contradiction, since a declared 
          or prescribed resolution to inquiry — a finishing point or “destiny” of 
          questioning, the point at which everything is known or attained — would 
          obviate the purpose of an ethics, which (in part) is to stage encounters 
          with always-changing matter, and to appreciate and contextualize potentiality.<a href="#_edn70"
  name="_ednref70" title=""><span>[70]</span></a> The moment at which something 
          is “known” is the moment at which one asks and links onto the next question. 
          “Of each actuality I’m uncertain and always was uncertain and such uncertainty 
          is certain”(<i>Happily</i> 36).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          “Reason,” Hejinian suggests that the phrase<i> Along comes something — 
          launched in context</i> characterizes and generates <i>dilemmatos</i>. 
          It embodies both a boundary and a perceptual relation to that boundary. 
          Dilemma, explains Hejinian, “comes from the Greek, <i>dilemmatos</i>, 
          and means ‘involving two assumptions.’” The boundary inferred by Hejinian’s 
          phrase is “not an edge but a conjunction,” and it consequently “bears 
          the <i>meaning</i> of conjunction: encounter, possible confusion, alteration 
          exerted through reciprocal influence”(1). Hejinian develops this flight-line 
          of reason by advocating a poetics “that has <i>dilemma</i> (as a border 
          under pressure of doubt, as a border in question) as one of its central 
          features.” Such a poetics will “vigorously question assumptions, including, 
          or especially its own”(1). In other words, it will situate itself along 
          or within boundaries — and so we return to a poetics of encounter. Hejinian’s 
          poetry performs a continuing series, or a serialized continuum, of meetings 
          along borders. It affirms a condition of worldliness or <i>Dasien</i> 
          — “this is happening” — while admitting and advancing interactivity and 
          reciprocal alteration among co-inciding elements.  In doing so, it offers 
          us inquiring languages for a mode of <i>being-toward-the-world</i>, the 
          core (descriptive) principal of Nancy’s community or world <i>in-becoming</i>.</font></p>

            in an essay entitled “O’s Affirmation,” of <i>border</i> as both a site 
            and an activity of linkage: “the border I mean...is not an edge, not 
            marginal, but an articulation and provocateur of palpability, the medium 
            (middle) of proliferating connections, where one thing feels the next”(1, 
            draft text sent to me by Hejinian in August 1998). “O’s Affirmation” 
            reads George Oppen’s poem “Of Being Numerous” and deals explicitly with 
            encountering “an actual world” and “being in the world.” A series of

            can almost be read as a signature kaleidoscope through which to view 
            Hejinian’s relationship to writing. My aim here is to understand community 
            not as a term of in-difference, but as a term of intricate, contradictory 
            and generative potentials; poetical, conceptual and social. In this, 
            I am possibly more optimistic (though perhaps less aware) than critic 
            Charles Altieri, who has referred recently to “the strident... replacing 
            of slogans about history (the buzzword of the eighties) by slogans about 
            community (our new toy).” See “Lyn Hejinian and the Possibilities of

            (2000) “bookend” the early and later stages of Hejinian’s writing career, 
            a fact alluded to by Hejinian during her presentation. Hejinian’s writings 
            on Gertrude Stein also include “Two Stein Talks,” <i>Temblor</i> 3 (Spring

            The text of “A Common Sense,” written by Hejinian in 1998 for a conference

            about cultural constructions of gender, Judith Butler proposes an idea 
            of being “always already” in language, or in a context where signifying 
            practices and  the meaning of “worldliness” are always reciprocally 
            linked. Judith Butler, <i>Gender Trouble</i> (London and New York: Routledge, 
            1990) 143. At a later point in the thesis, I deal with Wittgenstein’s 
            famous proposition in the <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> that 
            “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” See, for example, 
            Marjorie Perloff, <i>Wittgenstein’s Ladder: Poetic Language and the 
            Strangeness of the Ordinary</i> (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1996) 206-7.</font></p>

            in which she began to explore this technical principal.</font></p>
