        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Through 
          the insights her recent essay entitled “Doubt” makes possible, I want 
          to explore Fanny Howe’s engagement with the writing of Simone Weil. Weil’s 
          work is rare and compelling for its resistance to philosophical categories, 
          its yoking of spirituality and political commitment, and its calling for 
          a sacrificial suffering that eludes easy understandings of victimization. 
          Weil is consistently evoked in Howe’s work as a figure of political and 
          religious and intellectual commitment, a figure who pursued those commitments 
          through writing, but renounced the literary and the poetic. A prolific 
          writer with an incredibly wide emotional, intellectual, and stylistic 
          range, Howe has not renounced the poetic, but strips its lines of narcissistic 
          dazzle and packs them with words implosive with contradictions. The stylistic 
          skill and intellectual complexity of Howe’s work aspires toward the silence 
          of Weil’s renunciatory aesthetic, the emptiness full of presence Weil 
          encountered reading the Gospels in Greek: “A silence which is not an absence 
          of sound but which is the object of a positive sensation” (“Spiritual 
          Autobiography,” 18). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With 
          physical, spiritual, and political will, Weil demonstrated her claims 
          for the significance of “decreation”: the creative renunciation of the 
          self.  “There is absolutely no other free act which it is given to us 
          to accomplish—only the destruction of The Self.” (&#147;The Self&#148;79) 
          A prolific French philosopher and thoroughly self-sacrificing political 
          activist who died of self-inflicted starvation and tuberculosis during 
          World War II (she refused to eat because so many in Nazi occupied France 
          were dying of hunger),Weil is more than a demanding thinker and an inspirational 
          figure for Howe. A recent prose meditation entitled “Doubt” makes clear 
          that Howe reads Weil as a writer. Howe writes, “...Weil could be called 
          a poet, if Wittgenstein could...because of the longing for a transformative 
          insight dominating her word choices”(2). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          For Howe, Weil is a thinker and a figure whose longing for spiritual thought 
          was relentless and gentle, never satiated.  Weil thought and lived through 
          writing, and her political commitment found expression through the physical 
          act of writing and her scrupulous attention to words.  For Howe, Weil’s 
          body of work possesses a clarity and spiritual commitment so unique, that 
          her “abstractions sting” (1996, 447), her prose lines are “surgery on 
          modern thought” (2000, 3), and her austere style so perceptually fundamental 
          it suggests “the intermediary of thing to word to the void” (1996, 447). 
          Weil’s work came as close to the ground of materiality and the immediacy 
          of experience as one could without relinquishing language.  In <i>Gravity 
          and Grace</i>, Weil describes the act of writing in a way that connects 
          the body, the soul, and the social world. “In the operation of writing, 
          the hand which holds the pen, and the body and soul which are attached 
          to it, with all their social environment, are things of infinitesimal 
          importance for those who love the truth” (32).<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span> 
          [1] </span></a>  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Weil’s 
          influence on Howe cannot be denied; it is continual, always transforming. 
          Therefore, this essay doesn’t only reveal Weil’s influence; it attempts 
          to trace Howe’s efforts at enacting the rigor, complexity, and simplicity 
          of Weil’s thought, and the thoroughness with which she brought that thought 
          to the work of her life.  In a recent essay entitled  “Doubt” Howe cites 
          Weil’s desire “to be only an intermediary between the blank page and the 
          poem” and then states that this is a desire “for a whole-heartedness that 
          eliminates personality” (2000, 2). The work I will analyze in this essay—“Doubt,” 
          “Weil Over Void,” <i>Forged</i>, <i>One Crossed Out</i>, <i>Saving History</i>, 
          and <i>Indivisible</i>—renders the movement of Howe’s thought toward the 
          silencing of self that Weil desired and doggedly pursued.  “Weil Over 
          Void” is an elegant rendering of how thoroughly Weil wrote herself into 
          silence. Howe writes, </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She had 
            carried thought as far as it could go. There was no way I could address 
            her thought, in speech, therefore, because I would always be trailing 
            my subject. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
            is such a thing as experience that precedes speech...I would keep banging 
            that wall of silence—a reality as solid as a stone. (1996, 448)  </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          Weil’s distinct and almost counter-intuitive philosophy, finding silence 
          means an encounter with doubt. Not a doubt we might expect—skepticism—but 
          a doubt that is “the physical double of belief” and “allows a single gesture 
          to have a heart” (2000, 2). Howe’s work searches for the space of silence—the 
          space where doubt gives rise to belief, the doubt which makes belief possible—Weil 
          wanted to become. “The human face in repose and in silence is the face 
          I see,” Howe writes, “when what I have written approximates the unspeakable” 
          (1996, 448). This statement articulates the distinctive aspects of Howe’s 
          work. She doesn’t sharpen or polish her language into a textual mirror 
          that will reflect herself; she polishes words and sentences until their 
          depths and surfaces gleam with the image of another’s gaze and the actuality 
          of another’s suffering.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writing 
          of Virginia Woolf, whom she describes as “a maestro of lyric resistance,” 
          and the times in which she lived—dominated by secularism and Freudian 
          thought—Howe states that “[t]he hideous vocabulary of mental science crushed 
          her dazzling star thoughts into powder and brought her latent despair 
          into the open air” (2000, 3).  Alluding to the fear, exhaustion, and bravery 
          that summoned Woolf to the end of her life, Howe writes: “Anyone who tries, 
          as she did, out of a systematic training in secularism, to forge an expression 
          of belief is fighting against the odds” ( 2000, 3). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          The contemporary poet not only inspired by religious ideas and belief, 
          but seeking to express religious and ethical commitment within and through 
          poetry also fights against the odds and faces unique challenges. To secular 
          eyes and sensibilities, poetry and religion shape contradictory desires. 
          Religion orders and instructs; poetry wrestles words away from order and 
          instruction. Yet, both religion and poetry, at their best, make us suffer 
          through their particular forms of illuminated puzzlement, their fearless 
          confrontations with all the evacuated silence and noise that so explicitly 
          negates them. Howe’s work articulates its religious longing and belief 
          within, and perhaps because of, the negating noise of the world: “Determined 
          by day by need/ multiple bodies parceled into files/ computers chiming 
          cheerfully without appetite” (1999, 13), a line which could serve as a 
          tonal and thematic enactment of Weil’s assertion that “[t]he subject of 
          art is sensible and contingent beauty discerned through a network of chance 
          and evil” (“Beauty,” 377). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Howe’s work is unique in contemporary poetry for its exploration of religious 
          faith, ethics, politics, and suffering. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> 
          [2] </span></a> Howe’s words wrestle within the intersection of these 
          themes—the way they unpredictably test and strengthen each other—with 
          a detached, often harsh, tender and resigned voice that describes and 
          expresses the brutality of an ontology suffused with a belief in God. 
          In her novel <i>Saving History</i>, Howe writes, with a simultaneously 
          brave and weary candor:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">God announces 
            itself as affliction, as a pain that is gruesome. God doesn’t eat, but 
            wounds. You have to know this in order to live. (12)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Howe consistently pursues literature’s capacity to render God’s affliction 
          with a tough, imaginative, harsh, and vivid imagery. Henrietta, the main 
          character in Howe’s novel <i>Indivisible</i>, describes her physical experience 
          after leaving confession. In these lines, Howe displays her propensity 
          for a brutal visual clarity as well as her talent for re-imagining the 
          body in a way that is so disturbing and beautiful, it approaches something 
          like the holy. </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Then he 
            blessed me. Walking out, I felt I was dragging my skeleton like a pack 
            of branches. After all, a skeleton doesn’t clack inside the skin, but 
            is more like wood torn from a tree wrapped in cloth. (9)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like 
          so many of her contemporaries, Howe’s work seeks to poetically unsettle 
          and even strip away the self’s fictions of coherence. At the end of her 
          poem “Close Up,” Howe’s lines portrays a fragmented, ephemeral, and written 
          image of the self:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A human 
            face is pressed on glass; mirrors like armor<br>
            Break shapes into targets. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The woman’s 
            face on the other side of this pane—<br>
            Paper or fate?<br>
            Written in light, in either case. (1992 5)</font></p>
          </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          And yet, Howe takes the contemporary imperative to describe and stylistically 
          enact a postmodern dissolution of the self a step further. She sees the 
          self not only constructed by cultural fictions, but as ontologically bruised 
          and fractured, and permanently so. Therefore, the grave uncertainty Howe 
          faces and wrestles with in her work is all the more frightening because 
          it is not recoverable; it is the suffering of being that does not cease. 
          On the opening page of <i>Forged</i>, Howe writes, “Sold tickets to this 
          trip my self/ a fiction as fixed as the crucifixion/ or tracks hammered 
          into banked quarters” (1999, 3). These lines suggest a resigned awareness 
          of a fate tied to suffering, and a suffering mirrored in the urban landscape. 
          Howe develops the consequences of this imagery on the last page of this 
          collection: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Grind 
            and forge<br>
            for minimal spark and speed</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Time is 
            so intimate</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">then<br>
            it is finished<br>
            and you go on burning to a cinder<br>
            a forgery in figure only<br>
            signature cut to the wheels.  (23)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          The effort and resistance involved in forging a self and subjectivity 
          within and against time are reinforced by the harsh precision and intricate 
          swiftness Howe’s of language. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Doubt” 
          is a statement of Howe’s poetics enacts, explores, but does not synthesize 
          the contradictions of an ethically inspired spirituality and language’s 
          materiality, worldliness, and inevitable compromises. As I stated earlier, 
          the doubt Howe explores is not skepticism; it is an experience of uncertainty 
          at the heart of belief—an uncertainty that inspires a restless and continual 
          pursuit of the contradictions at the heart of language and ontology. In 
          an essay entitled “Contradiction,” Weil states, “Contradiction experienced 
          to the very depths of being tears us heart and soul: it is the cross” 
          (239). Howe’s exploration of language’s contradictions, carefully sharpened 
          by her skill at rendering the spiritual thought possible within literature, 
          begins to approximate the experience of ontological suffering Weil articulates 
          and enacted in her spiritual and physical life. The difficulty and possibility 
          of approximating this state seems to continually incite Howe’s tremendous 
          prolific and increasingly complex literary pursuits. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Weil is crucial to Howe’s poetics of commitment, her dogged resistance 
          to letting her work repeat the force that Weil so eloquently and clearly 
          analyzes in her essay “The Iliad or the Poem of Force.” In that well-known 
          essay, written at the onset of World War II, Weil defines force as “that 
          x that turns anybody who is subjected to it into a thing” (163). Howe’s 
          work seeks not only to represent those who are objectified and disregarded 
          with subjectivity and specificity, but draws upon the imaginative act 
          of writing as a political and empathetic means of connecting to those 
          who are rendered things in the collective imagination. Howe often highlights 
          her presence as a writer and a consciousness in the midst of reflecting 
          upon her own resistances to, identifications with, and detachments from 
          the brute forces that inflict cruelty and suffering. In <i>Saving History</i>, 
          Howe writes: “I identify with the women standing back and watching the 
          crucifixion drama, because I know how easy it is to become a participant 
          in cruelty” (12). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Writing about her portrayal of an abusive husband who as a child suffered 
          and witnessed physical torture Howe asks: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I don’t 
            know this man but I suffer for him. How? I live out his drama, mentally, 
            trying to imagine the way it felt to be him. I hope that in this imaginative 
            action, some of his pain will revert to me. If I don’t do this, who 
            else will? (1993, 13)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          The characters in Howe’s work sin and suffer, sometimes of free-will, 
          sometimes against their volition; mostly they sin and suffer in a bewildering 
          entanglement of free-will and compulsion and hope. Weil states that in 
          “the teeth of all experience of crimes committed, suffered, and witnessed” 
          the hope that “good and evil will not be done to him” is “all that is 
          sacred in every human being” (“Human Personality,” 51).  In a poetry collection 
          entitled <i>One Crossed Out</i>, Howe writes of a young homeless woman’s 
          hatred of and submission to the hope which emerges amidst a scene of danger 
          and despair: </font></p>
        <blockquote>

            emotional conditions she can’t ever run to catch anything.<br>

            remarked her breathing was hard.<br>
            A walkbridge across the river led to a health bookstore where she hoped 
            they were going.<br>
            She hated hope when she knew she couldn’t kill it.     (1997, 49)</font></p>

          wanted to focus on “Doubt” because of its intellectual clarity—the swift 
          and steady movement of its articulations and associations—can lead to 
          a new understanding of the ways Howe’s poetics expand and deepen within 
          the rich and austere contradictions of Weil’s thought. “Doubt” helps me 
          understand that Howe’s prolific literary production is an expression of 
          a struggling belief forced through and transformed within the materiality 
          of language. Writing of the secular culture of the intellect Weil lived 
          within, Howe states, “You have to make yourself believe” (2000, 3). The 
          essay speaks to the depth and complexity of Howe’s pursuit of doubt, and 
          its twin of belief, so central to Weil’s thought and so pertinent to Howe’s 
          poetry of belief as it emerges and continues to expand within secular 
          contexts and landscapes. “Doubt” reveals Howe exploring the possibilities 
          for writing to expand, test, and strengthen belief without relinquishing 
          an attentiveness to the grim materiality of the world and the people saturated 
          within its misery.  In <i>Forged</i>, Howe writes, “Wet shoes drain the 
          ache from human faces/ as wood leaks ashes” (1999, 12). While it is an 
          important text in and of itself, the compelling and stubborn oddities 
          of Howe’s work find their conceptual inspiration and articulation in “Doubt.” 
          How else to understand the contradictions in the following line from <i>Forged</i>: 
          “Is a rose already pink inside its idiot dirt” (20)?  In this line, the 
          words reflect the stubborn harshness of a hope inspired by doubt, a hope 
          that has not been relinquished. Howe writes in “Doubt”: “Hope resists 
          extermination as a roach does” (2000, 1).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          words in <i>Forged</i> emerge from the tense, transformative, and precarious 
          place between doubt and belief. The poems scour across an English landscape 
          dense with the colors and textures of cynicism and hope: “Rolling hills 
          slashed by dull buildings/ severed this path to the mystic heart of red” 
          (10). Throughout this small, coarse, and eloquent but implosive collection, 
          Howe continually places demands for hope and desires for meaning within 
          an urban landscape thoroughly stained by capitalism, conformity, and despair.  
          In the following lines, Howe’s rhythm and cadence match and reinforce 
          the monotonous and stacked transfixions of quotidian submission, and the 
          last line opens like the memory of a prayer. </font></p>

          In “Doubt” Howe links Weil to Virginia Woolf and Edith Stein, two women 
          like Weil who experienced an impassioned relation to language and understood 
          that relation within the spiritual, intellectual, and political contexts 
          of their lives.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>  
          Though the forms of their beliefs and commitments were unique, each one 
          “sought salvation in words” (2000, 1). In the essay “The Nature of Language,” 
          Martin Heidegger describes what it might mean to have an impassioned relation 
          to language: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To undergo 
            an experience with language, then, means to let ourselves be properly 
            concerned by the claim of language by entering into and submitting to 
            it. If it is true that man finds the proper abode for his existence 
            in language—whether he is aware of it or not—then an experience we undergo 
            with language will touch the innermost nexus of our existence. (57)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Heidegger goes on to explain that this experience does not involve clarity 
          or full expression, but the inability to “find the right word for something 
          that concerns us, carries us away, oppresses and encourages us” (59). 
          For the women Howe writes of in “Doubt,” the years 1941-1944 presented 
          experiences they did not have the language to describe or control. Their 
          lives were stretched across the brutal edge of history: Woolf’s suicide 
          in the midst of the Germany’s bombing campaign of England (1941); Stein’s 
          death at Auschwitz (August 1942); Weil’s death from starvation and tuberculosis 
          in an English hospital (1944). Language did not save these women, yet 
          their scrutiny of and attention to language has political and ethical 
          reverberations now. The different but equally important ways these women 
          forged their experiences of language against and within the claims of 
          politics and history reveal what might be at stake when attending to language 
          carefully and ethically. In “The Power of Words,” an essay she wrote in 
          response to the Spanish Civil War, Weil states: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To clarify 
            thought, to discredit the intrinsically meaningless words, and to define 
            the use of words by precise analysis—to do this, strange though it may 
            appear, might be a way of saving lives. (222)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          “Doubt” Howe develops this ethical link between language and lives with 
          a forthright and weary candor: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
            we would all like to know if the individual person is a phenomenon spiritually 
            or culturally conceived and why everyone doesn’t kill everyone else, 
            including themselves, since they can—poets act out the problems with 
            their words. (1)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Individual words are the site of ethical choices. Howe begins the essay 
          “Doubt” discussing word choices, their connotations and consequences: 
          “Why not say \‘heart-sick’ instead of \ ‘despairing’” (1). Further into 
          the essay, Howe explores and questions the possibilities for expression 
          within an individual poetic line. She asks, “Is there, perhaps, a quality 
          of each person—hidden like a laugh inside a sob—that loves even more than 
          it loves to live? If there is, can it be expressed in the form of a lyric 
          line?” (1). Questions like these suggest that Howe questions—doubts—the 
          ethical pertinence of literature at the completion of every line and every 
          text. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          At the beginning of his essay “The Image of Proust,” Walter Benjamin writes, 
          “It has rightly been said that all great works of literature found a genre 
          or dissolve one—that they are, in other words, special cases” (201). Howe 
          is prolific and successful in prose and poetry, and her recent work such 
          as “Doubt” dissolves each genre into the other. “Doubt” is a lyrical essay 
          composed of aphoristic statements that are not intended to be lines of 
          poetry, but nonetheless possess a poetic rhythm and cadence inflected 
          by the movement of thought carried as far as it can go at any moment. 
          The form of “Doubt” is a manifestation of Howe’s desire to think poetically 
          and to call attention not to forms and genres, but to the movement of 
          spiritual and poetic inquiry, what Howe describes as Weil’s “longing for 
          transformative insight dominating her word choices” (2). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          Weil is known for the honed and austere clarity of her prose, but “Doubt” 
          calls attention to the poetic aspects of Weil’s thought, life, and writing. 
          Weil wanted to be a poet, and wrote a prose poem entitled “Prelude,” but 
          was wary of poetry’s seductive dazzle, as is Howe. In “Weil Over Void” 
          Howe describes contemporary work as “Babble, excited showing-off, the 
          prettiness of reports coming in from a poetry which is the equivalence 
          of an I.Q. test” (448).  “Thinking,” Heidegger writes, “cuts furrows into 
          the soul of being” (70). Howe’s work asserts that poetry can be an instrument 
          of thinking that will find, explore, express, and perhaps inspire and 
          inflict beliefs that have transformed from and emerged within doubt. </font></p>
