            then in “Ruth” the spacer—the self-<i>object</i> that is not her—is 
            enacted, sounded. The spacer is “called up” on the formal profile or 
            countenance of “Ruth’s” pages, the spacer takes up space. Cognition 
            is both re-cognized and reconfigured. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The form 
            of the “(un-sayable, thus not— / pictured around the un-” makes the 
            pages of “Ruth” pictures of the not picturable. The spacer appears as 
            actual blank space on the page, as the many hyphens, dashes and elongated 
            hyphens that mark both linkage of a thought to other thoughts, as well 
            as thought’s impossibility to either continue, or be heard in the medium 
            of this language or by some readers—thus some of the hyphens extend 
            to become lines separating text from text—an absolute bottom line, the 
            place of what can’t appear or the underlining of, the calling attention 
            to the mother's speech, undetectable by most readers. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The pages 
            of “Ruth” hold together as they fly apart, a weaving of rubber bands, 
            or air. The tension spans short poetic line and long-lined prosaic commentary 
            and response in which some parts of the poem write to and elaborate 
            on other parts, between direct conversation with Levinas, with all of 
            “The arbiters at the / heart of the process”(88) and, again, between 
            something or someone that is not audible, or might be heard only as 
            a muttering in the wings, a private conversation a reader eavesdrops 
            on or participates in or doesn’t hear or comprehend at all (depending 
            on the reader). This is also the tension between those who are present, 
            are presented, those who have “proper names”(84) on the pages of “Ruth” 
            and those whose names or person are not picturable, sayable, have no 
            discourse in the Judeo-Christian or Greek traditions from which Levinas’s 
            thinking is derived. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Greek 
            appears (at least three times) breaking the surface of the page and 
            calling attention to the letter, that is, the letter and word as linguistic 
            passage locating the historical sources of the conditions under discussion. 
            Greek, French, parentheses, quotation marks, an equal sign, italics, 
            the last page—a list of “essays on going together” which are not essays 
            and appear with a long dash at the beginning of each “essay” on the 
            list; bold face (musical notation?) brackets <b>}</b> similar to that 
            (and conjuring the poetics) Zukofsky uses in “lower limit speech / upper 
            limit music”—all keep the reader on the hook, without rest, picking 
            through “a garden of stumbling blocks,” taken to task, to the task of 
            attending to the page, seeing “take itself for vision”(94) whether anything 
            besides the usual visible can be seen, whether “—a representation of 
            a / gesture or something / parallel to a gesture” is present.(95; Zukofsky, 
            138)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some of 
            the pages engage in a serious mimicry of conventional formal structures 
            <i>they</i> can recognize. For example on the third page of “Ruth” some 
            of the forms of traditional western philosophical thought and argument 
            make a fleeting mimetic appearance. This is a demonstration of how the 
            visible looks, (a demonstration of demonstration). This is also demonstration 
            as subversion, a use of the tools of convention to another end: at the 
            top of the page definitions of the terms under discussion are presented, 
            the page is an actual and mock diagrammatic map out of which “vs.” shines 
            from the middle. Then beneath the diagram, prose is unleashed in commentary 
            and elaboration on the terms and the form in which the terms of the 
            discussion just <i>appeared</i> above. Mimicry is necessary because 
            “Now the man speaks it, it’s <i>visible</i>”(75). Mimicry is one of 
            the only methods available in “call[ing] up” the speech of the spacer, 
            that which cannot be seen—that which is all that escapes the page—like 
            music whose marks can be noted but whose sound must be made by the reader 
            herself—or heard when the instruments (languages) are played. [Played 
            vs. contained] Thus it is necessary to—“un-“ do the terms while employing 
            them, “by definition, in other words / The mother<i> better not</i> 
            speak.” The pages of “Ruth” occur “in other words” in the sounds of 
            “<i>better not </i>speak” a place made on the pages but also existing 
            off the page. Just as “Our physical appearance our greatest disguise”(77) 
            so the appearance of the page in “Ruth” is also a disguise—not “pictured” 
            but proposing a possible <i>heard</i>—lyric of the mother who violates 
            the order of orders. The page poses as face but is actually, face off, 
            face of voice, countenance:</font></p>

            addressed in “Ruth” and appears as EL, and, as the introductory note 
            to “Ruth” says, “The directness of the piece is clearly in response 
            to the hyperabstraction of the official media representation of the 
            Gulf war <i>they</i> called ‘desert storm’”(72). <i>My Bird Book</i>, 
            Cole’s most recent book previous to <i>Mars</i><u>,</u> also comes into 
            the discussion here, as in the same introductory note to “Ruth,” Cole 
            states that “Ruth,” “follows on its development from <i>My Bird Book</i>, 
            especially the last piece ‘Destitution,’ from its spanning territory 
            between and including prose and the poem.” All quotations without attribution 
            are from “Ruth.” </font></p>
