        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Michele 
          Leggott, a poet and academic, first encountered Hyde’s writing when <i>A 
          Home in this World</i> was published in 1984.  As Mary Paul explains, 
          Leggott “first read Hyde as a university teacher, and grew so interested 
          in her poetry that she incorporated lines and echoes from Hyde in her 
          own series ‘Blue Irises,’ only later coming to write on her in a more 
          academic context”(147).  This combination of the personal, the creative 
          and the academic is the defining triad of Leggott’s appropriation of Hyde, 
          whose literary and critical style has become, by its textual rhetoric 
          and authorial charisma, a methodological and stylistic ur-text for Robin 
          Hyde criticism since the mid-1990s.  How Leggott’s analysis works needs 
          to be explained, along with a mapping of its influence and its limits.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Leggott’s 
          writerly interest in Robin Hyde came to prominence in 1994-95, with the 
          appearance in 1994 of her third collection of poetry, <i>DIA</i>, which 
          included the sequence “Blue Irises.”  In the same year, an article by 
          Leggott was published in the women’s studies journal <i>Hecate</i>, entitled 
          “Opening the Archive: Robin Hyde, Eileen Duggan and the Persistence of 
          Record.”  By the time this article was reprinted the following year in 
          a volume which Leggott co-edited, <i>Opening the Book: New Essays on New 
          Zealand Writing</i>, her reputation as a Robin Hyde scholar was established 
          in the academy.  It was also in 1995 that Leggott, with her student Lisa 
          Docherty, re-catalogued for the Auckland University Library the collection 
          of Hyde poetry manuscripts which Gloria Rawlinson had prepared in the 
          1940s—creating an “Inventory of Poetry Manuscripts” which clarified and 
          expanded the work Rawlinson had already done.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>What, then, is the thesis which Leggott argues, and why has it 
          had so much influence on Robin Hyde studies?  At its heart, Leggott’s 
          argument calls for a return to reading, of Robin Hyde, of women poets, 
          of manuscripts and of poetry itself.  This call is consistent across her 
          work of this period, in both poetry and prose:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I want 
            heart but I want scope too.  Big projects for poetry, like raiding and 
            rewriting its androcentric history.  I am not interested in the one-page 
            poem unless it is a constituent of something bigger, unless its brevity 
            is a training ground so I can read to marathon length.  This is where 
            complexity comes in, and I welcome it.  Complexity is about endurance, 
            about surviving over time and distance to ask old questions in new places.  
            (<i>DIA</i> 1994, 26)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
            1939 the fight was lost along with Hyde’s life and the intervention 
            of the second war.  What remains to us are the poems and their codings, 
            plus the orientations of Hyde’s essay journalism, letters and autobiographical 
            prose.  A selection of that journalism is currently in print; the poems, 
            letters and autobiographical material are out of print or still in manuscript.  
            Why are we so slow to read the poet who most disrupts the orthodoxy 
            set up by the contents and introduction of <i>A Book of New Zealand 
            Verse 1923-1945</i>?  (“Opening the Archive,” 276)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now we 
            should turn to the manuscripts collected with utterly partisan care 
            by Julia McLeely and Grace Burgess [of Eileen Duggan’s writing], by 
            Bill Edge, Gloria Rawlinson and Derek Challis, and begin to read.  (290)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          can see two things here: that Leggott’s argument has more than a hint 
          of a long-term project about it, and that this project is grand in scale: 
          to return Robin Hyde’s poetry to the reading public, with the subsequent 
          re-orienting of Hyde’s status as a writer that this implies.  To this 
          end, Leggott is a powerful and indeed forceful rhetorician, writing in 
          a manner that reorganises the focii of Robin Hyde research, so that Hyde 
          appears not merely as a figure who wrote well in many different genres, 
          but as the Poet-Artist she herself aspired to be.  Thus, in Leggott’s 
          analysis, the project of the scholars associated with the New Women’s 
          Press becomes the background to her own work of bringing the distant past 
          into the immediate present:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When Gillian 
            Boddy in 1991 quotes Pat Lawlor in 1935 quoting Jessie Mackay several 
            years previously on the subject of her younger contemporaries Eileen 
            Duggan and Robin Hyde, the voice on the wind seems impossibly distant.  
            To ground Mackay’s statement and its original context is one search 
            among many that might alter the sense we presently have of all three 
            writers as peripheral to the founding of a canon of New Zealand poetry.  
            (266)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          redistributive aims are also present in Leggott’s poetry, as she explains 
          in her “note” to <i>DIA</i>:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is 
            time we listened in other places in order to draw some of those shadowy 
            figures back into the conversation about language and place.  To this 
            end I have practised a kind of ventriloquism, picking out white-hot 
            lines from the poems of (among others) Robin Hyde and Eileen Duggan 
            and recombining them with an ear for the heart, complexity, and engagement 
            with which they were written.  This is homage.  (26)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          general attributions leave the reader to engage in the research and reading 
          which Leggott herself has already done, engaging in a game which is an 
          unusual mixture of the academic and the playfully postmodern.  The poems 
          of “Blue Irises” thus become a sequence of cryptograms; word puzzles which 
          force the reader to “begin to read”(1995, 290) in the fashion that Leggott 
          has instructed.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>In this manner, Leggott not only reconstructs literary history, 
          but also writing itself.  She uses images of discovery and construction 
          alongside each other, so that her work reads as both an archaeology and 
          an architecture of Robin Hyde, rather than a more fully postmodern exercise 
          in historiography.  Thus, after the assertion in <i>DIA</i> that her “ventriloquism” 
          of Hyde <i>et al</i>’s “white-hot lines” is not plagiarism but “homage,” 
          Leggott explains that this homage has “also shown me how to make a matrix 
          where none was visible or audible.  It is a kind of speaking together, 
          problematic but full of possibilities”(26).  In “Opening the Archive,” 
          however, she argues for the necessity of discovering, rather than “mak[ing]” 
          this “matrix”: “There is a lost matrix of women poets whose presence in 
          our literature needs urgent reappraisal.  How it was lost, and why, are 
          absorbing questions; but more important still is the matter and nature 
          of matrix, with its suggestions of support, nurture and numerousness”(267).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Elsewhere, Leggott’s approach to the tension between the roles 
          of researcher and inventor is more irreverent; indeed, she goes to the 
          extent of laying literary traps for the unwary dilettante, as the next 
          extracts show:</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          is throughout Leggott’s writing a tension between the unreliability of 
          language and the passion of its speaker, between textual unreliability 
          and emotional truth.  Her turning away from critics such as Gillian Boddy, 
          whose approach in <i>Disputed Ground</i> produces only a “voice on the 
          wind” which “seems impossibly distant”(266), means that her own work necessarily 
          takes a new prominence in Robin Hyde research.  Leggott makes apparent 
          in her text a sense of working alone, outside of a community of research, 
          which is in notable contrast with the earlier collaborative efforts of 
          Phillida Bunkle, Linda Hardy, and Jacqueline Matthews in their reviews 
          of the film on Robin Hyde, <i>Iris</i>.  By such assertions as “I am working 
          in the dark” or “I am moving by a kind of textual infra-red”(269), Leggott’s 
          present-day is ironically emptied of the very literary community whose 
          work precedes her own.  It is clear that in attending Hyde’s poetry, particularly 
          the many poems that remain unpublished, Leggott in “Opening the Archive” 
          feels that she is travelling alone.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Despite this sense of isolation, Leggott’s re-reading of Hyde’s 
          poetry introduces to the reader much that is new and important.  Most 
          famously, Leggott identifies, specifically in the sequence “The Beaches” 
          from the longer series “Houses by the Sea”, a series of revelations “[f]olded 
          into it, by enigma and double coding”: “the narratives of emergent female 
          sexuality, something coming the other way, determining contemporary possibility 
          against a dream of history”(270).  What Leggott seems to mean by this 
          last sentence is that it is possible to find in the present day references 
          to a genital femininity that is both anatomical and metaphorical.  Once 
          Leggott has identified the former, as a vulval image “masked for propriety”(271) 
          in the lines “What makes the sweethearts quarrel? / Third mouth, pink 
          as coral”(270), the metaphorical becomes easier to elucidate: “Hot cream 
          flood, peaks and shouts, coral pink mouth.  Hyde hides what androcratic 
          society will not countenance: sexuality celebrated and inscribed by a 
          woman”(271).  These specificities then enable Leggott to define her wider 
          poetics of Hyde, woman and writer:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde is 
            about hiding, about surviving by hiding, and she stamps the exigency 
            as a personal signature in every part of her work.  It starts with the 
            deliberate androgyny of the assumed name but it travels also through 
            endless references in her poems to rainbows, prisms, bridges and arcs.  
            The rainbow is the sign of Iris, she who connects heaven and earth; 
            Iris Wilkinson elaborated the clue of her given name, producing an exquisite 
            tension between presence and concealment of herself in her work.  (271)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>There seems no reason to disagree with Leggott’s poetic schema; 
          her subsequent description of what she calls Hyde’s “baby poems” as “deeply 
          hidden and obliquely expressed”(288) and thus evoking the loss of Hyde’s 
          first son, is both literary and wise: “Ghosts like Hyde’s never leave 
          entirely though they may be made over”(289).  Despite Leggott’s assertion 
          of her textual isolation, the insights her argument presents for the reader 
          can be read as achieved by an analytical means which has more in common 
          with her feminist precursors than she suggests.  A constituent part of 
          Leggott’s feminism seems to be its inversions of masculine equivalents; 
          thus we should read Hyde because she “most disrupts the orthodoxy set 
          up”(276) in Curnow’s 1945 poetry anthology, or because her poems contain 
          not the singular, masculine phallus, but multiple hips and thighs, breasts 
          and genitals.  Of the lines “rose afterglow / In endless stillness: prowling 
          to the crests / Of great bare hills, upthrust like goddess-breasts”(277-8) 
          from the poem “Zoological,” Leggott suggests that “[t]he juxtaposition 
          of goddess-breasts and local hills is strange only until vision doubles 
          and we see what is before us—the geomorphic body of Papatuaanuku”(278).  
          And Leggott situates her own research within the tracing of what Patrick 
          Evans has called “the distaff line,”<a href="#_edn3"
  name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> that “lost matrix of women poets”(Leggott, 267) 
          whose recovery gives us “a capacity for shaping New Zealand poetry in 
          the first half of the century as a politically alert, humanitarian enterprise, 
          diverse in its subjects and styles but run on sympathetic and highly reticulated 
          energies that took as their point of departure the socially progressive 
          atmosphere of the late colonial period”(267-8).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The problem here is the dialectical relationship between Leggott’s 
          reconstructed poetics and the “cultural nationalism inimical to previous 
          competences”(266) whose influence she wants to refute.  In the pairings 
          I have identified—orthodoxy/unorthodoxy, phallus/vulva, “the colonial 
          dilemma”(Bertram 1953, 191) / “the socially progressive atmosphere of 
          the late colonial period”(Leggott 1995, 268)—we can see the way in which 
          Leggott’s approach is similar to the feminism of Bunkle <i>et al</i>, 
          which was itself locked in dialectic with the masculinism of the cultural 
          nationalists.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a><span>   
          </span>In such a dialectic, feminism functions as a kind of “better” masculinism, 
          matching the dominant discourse’s concerns with a tit-for-tat offering 
          of feminine equivalents.  Leggott does not, in her 1995 article, identify 
          any difficulty in this particular dialectic, nor does she signal explicitly 
          any alternatives.  By 1999, however, she is pursuing another line of Robin 
          Hyde research, and we find in a volume by Mary Paul, published in that 
          year, a rehearsal of the problem I have just identified.  Paul’s <i>Her 
          Side of the Story: Readings of Mander, Mansfield, &amp; Hyde</i> and Leggott’s 
          editing of <i>The Book of Nadath</i> provide the final touchstones of 
          my analysis of the Robin Hyde critical tradition.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Leggott’s edited edition of <i>The Book of Nadath</i> was published 
          in 1999.  This project had occupied Leggott and Auckland University Press 
          for some time, drawing on existing fragments of the long poem in manuscript 
          and typescript, some in the Auckland University Library Collection, some 
          held by Hyde’s son, Derek Challis.  The editorial introduction to the 
          reconstituted <i>Book</i> is as much an exposition of Leggott’s critical 
          thinking as it is a guide to the text.  The construction of textuality 
          remains Leggott’s primary focus; like her own poems in <i>DIA</i>, she 
          has assembled Nadath piece by piece from disparate locations.  Here, however, 
          she makes a necessarily emphatic case for textual unity and the authority 
          of her edition, which implicitly addresses the problem of the tension 
          between discovery and construction that exists in “Opening the Archive.”  
          <i>The Book of Nadath</i>, Leggott suggests, is best read not as a postmodern 
          assemblage but as an act of historical retrieval:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If <i>The 
            Book of Nadath</i> stretches over a good two-thirds of 1937, its manuscript 
            tells the first part of the story.  It is a powerful tool for reckoning 
            up the beginning of <i>Nadath</i>, because for over half of the handwritten 
            poem the narrative order is Hyde’s, and because 30 of those pages are 
            written on Exquisite Bond, a paper she reserved for handwriting, and 
            on which she drafted a number of the poems written at Whangaroa early 
            in 1937.  Considered alongside the northern ambience of “Nadath and 
            the Master of Wheels”(AU Ms #4) and “The House of Woman”(AU Ms #5), 
            the 30 pages of Exquisite Bond draw <i>Nadath</i> physically closer 
            to Hyde’s three-week sojourn at Whangaroa in February 1937.  A stack 
            of paper or a writing pad may be carried from one place to another and 
            used anywhere, but if that is the case it is still revealing that the 
            poem follows in the settings of some of its sections Hyde’s own journeys 
            in early 1937.  (xiii)</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her introduction to <i>The Book of Nadath</i>, Leggott conditions Hyde’s

          material Hyde wrote in 1937: “the completion of <i>The Godwits Fly</i> 
          at Whangaroa, the writing of <i>A Home in This World</i> at Waiatarua 
          in March and the winter composition of <i>Nor the Years Condemn</i> at 
          Castor Bay and Milford”(xiii).  In making a case for <i>The Book of Nadath</i> 
          as “Hyde’s 1937 metatext”(xiii), and as a metatext more generally for 
          Hyde’s cultural times, Leggott returns to that staple of Hyde criticism, 
          the writer’s biography.  The “Introduction” to her edition of <i>Nadath</i> 
          has a much stronger biographical element than “Opening the Archive,” providing, 
          if not revelations, then new inferences about the young writer’s life.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>In keeping with the tone of “Opening the Archive,” these inferences 
          are tied up with female sexuality, in particular, the nature of Hyde’s 
          relationship with her Avondale doctor, Gilbert Tothill.  It is not so 
          much the issue of the role of Hyde’s biography in considering her work 
          that Leggott considers, but rather the question of which incidents in 
          Hyde’s life should be subject to literary-critical probing, and for what 
          purpose.  The section in “Nadath Speaks to His Love” where “Nadath hears 
          the voice of the [lost] beloved issuing from his own lips, counselling 
          peace, and decides not to let love go out of his heart”(xvii) is linked 
          by Leggott to a number of extant poems by Hyde: verses edited out of a 
          1937 poem whose expunged lines include “The guest is gone / Seen but set 
          free, partaken and with-held, / And in this dream to last this day, Forever”(xviii) 
          and three short poems (including one placed by Rawlinson in <i>Houses 
          by the Sea</i> as “The Miracle of Abundance”), whose evocations, suggests 
          Leggott, provide “compounding senses of layered reality”(xix), a reality 
          whose constituent factors are loss and dream: “Yet I remembered not whose 
          lips lay late upon / My eyes, nor felt the dark disturbed by my lover 
          — / He that had been and passed”(xx).  The historical problem for Leggott 
          is here the way in which Hyde has positioned her speakers; should we read 
          these verses as biographical revelation or the projection of a wish?  
          Leggott’s textual consideration of this concern is evocative and elliptical, 
          chafing at the edges of euphemism as she attempts to decipher the narrative 
          intentions of a writer who once referred to her craft, squid-like, as 
          “Squirting Ink.”<a

          </span>In “Opening the Archive,” Leggott identified the figures around 
          whose loss Hyde constructs a number of narratives as Hyde’s first son, 
          Robin, and her friend, Harry Sweetman.  Here, her attribution is different, 
          and not without controversy:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The person 
            Hyde lost and who seems to stand at the back of these and other poems 
            she wrote 1934-37 [including <i>Nadath</i>] is the doctor at Avondale 
            who restored her health and self-esteem, Gilbert M. Tothill.  [....] 
            <i>The Book of Nadath</i>, the unpublished 1934 Autobiography and 1935 
            Journal and now the poetry archive itself make Gilbert Tothill unavoidable 
            in Hyde’s post-1933 work.  That she struggled with her feelings for 
            him is in no doubt.  That in her writing she turned him into a saviour, 
            a healer whose counsel is always peace, is also apparent.  (xxi)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Leggott 
          in her introduction thus grapples with the oblique but identifiable causality 
          that exists between Tothill and Hyde’s writing; Hyde’s relationship with 
          Tothill is not merely a starting point for her literary thinking, but 
          rather something that she “turned into” the reveries and romances of her 
          poetry.  The question of whether there was any historical reality behind 
          these reveries and romances, and what its nature might have been, is one 
          Leggott here addresses in a similar manner to her consideration of Hyde 
          and sexuality in “Opening the Archive,” by initiating a reading of the 
          sexual signposts that Hyde’s poetry manuscripts offer up.  Citing a letter 
          from Hyde to “her Dunedin benefactor W. Downie Stewart and his sister 
          (9 September 1937)”(xxiii), Leggott argues of Hyde’s remark “I saw [Tothill] 
          on Sunday last for the first time in months—he just arrived without notice” 
          that “[w]hat lay beneath the cheery account of that day as Hyde describes 
          it is the distance between what she called ‘spruce record’ and manuscript 
          poems with all their verses intact”(xxiii).  Ultimately, Leggott’s analysis 
          must end where it began, gesturing towards Hyde’s narrative games while 
          at the same time highlighting the present inability of the critical community 
          to answer the “did they or didn’t they” curiosity that reading <i>Nadath</i> 
          and other poems from this period necessarily piques.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>In such gnomic sentences as “Great art in the balance with social 
          transgression?”(xix), Leggott mimics the way in which Hyde’s poems both 
          gesture to and obscure the possibility of a reading that throws some biographical 
          light on the dark days of Hyde’s 1937 subsistence and the bright lights 
          of her writing at this time.  Leggott nonetheless engages in a modicum 
          of biographical attribution, claiming that “in her writing [Hyde] turned 
          [Tothill] into a saviour”(xxi), but the rest, it seems, is silence: “Looked 
          at autobiographically, the passage is a feat of mirror-imaging and gender 
          reversals carried out with shifting pronouns worthy of a sick man’s (woman’s) 
          vision”(xxii).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Part of what makes Leggott’s analysis reflect in its composition 
          the complexity of the questions she is addressing is the way in which 
          her introduction is primarily grounded in a limited context: the writing 
          and movements of Hyde herself.  Leggott’s work on Hyde to date is thus 
          characterised by a return to textuality through an epistemology which 
          is still feminist but detached from the many historical referents which 
          we see in Bunkle <i>et al</i>.  In this way, Hyde often reads as a construction 
          of Leggott’s own literary imagination as a figure who shares, in another 
          “feat of mirror-imaging,” the imaginative and creative concerns of Leggott 
          herself.  In this manner it is sometimes difficult, when reading Leggott’s 
          criticism, to imagine the figure of Hyde as historically independent from 
          Leggott’s literary imagination.  Just as Leggott’s tendency to use sentence 
          fragments to make her most emphatic assertions (“The difference between 
          cleverness and magic”(1995, 269), “Destruction?  Knowledge?”(1999, xxxii)) 
          reminds the reader of her vocation as a poet, Leggott’s own verses, in 
          the “Blue Irises” sequence, are infused with fragments of Hyde’s writing: 
          </font></p>

          </span>In <i>The Book of Nadath</i>, then, we see Leggott take a more 
          conservative editorial position in order to focus attention on her particular 
          interest in the relationship between Hyde and Tothill.  This is a regression 
          from her more postmodern, playful position in the complementary projects 
          of <i>DIA</i> and “Opening the Archive,” but it cements Leggott’s scholarly 
          authority over her material in a manner that is at times surprisingly 
          akin to James Bertram in his 1953 article, “Robin Hyde: A Reassessment”.  
          Though Leggott’s criticism is not, like Bertram’s, overdetermined, there 
          remain few points of exit for the reader who seeks to find in it a Leggott 
          outside of Hyde, or a Hyde outside of Leggott.  Thus, the words Rawlinson 
          cites as Hyde’s closing the door on her life become part of Leggott’s 
          assembling of her own poetic and academic identity.<a href="#_edn7"

          another critic how to do their job, it is important to note here that 
          such a method is closed rather than open ended, in its epistemology at 
          least.  Despite Leggott’s assertion that “[t]here are always two versions”(1999, 
          xxxiv), the close and complex relationship between Hyde’s textual presence 
          and her own suggest that sometimes, there is only one.</font></p>

          are not automatons, and despite the beguiling nature of Leggott’s Hydian 
          univocality, it is possible to read and appreciate Leggott’s work on Hyde 
          without being fully drawn into her critical orbit.  The critic who demonstrates 
          this is a friend and one-time colleague of Leggott’s, Mary Paul.  Paul’s 
          two chapters on Hyde in her critical volume <i>Her Side of the Story</i> 
          adopt an explicitly revisionist, experimental approach, whose results 
          approximate a new historicist reading of Robin Hyde in her times; an attempt 
          to restore an historical and political context to Hyde’s writing.  In 
          “Robin Hyde: From Incoherence to Immersion,” Paul accounts for Robin Hyde 
          criticism according to a two-camp model, examining the tensions and the 
          limits of the critical points of view espoused first by the cultural nationalists, 
          then by the 1980s feminist retrievalists.  Thus, Paul suggests of “The 
          Dusky Hills” (a poem which Leggott also analyses in “Opening the Archive”):

        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is 
            the kind of short poem that was seen as tripping easily off Hyde’s tongue 
            and pen as if her facility were a liability.  The theme of this poem 
            is familiar—strength coming from the hills as in the biblical psalm—and 
            her poem could therefore be seen as conventional in its ideas as well 
            as its language.  (131)</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Paul 
          then goes on to rehearse a feminist reading of the same text, similar 
          to Leggott’s summation that “[c]onventional landscape imagery is reversed.” 
          “The lines evoke the image of a baby’s head, gently tucked in against 
          its mother and receiving its mother’s kiss, as well as a baby’s mouth 
          tucked over her nipple.  In these terms the images are unconventional 
          and intense”(Paul, 141).  Through this method, Paul attempts to restore 
          to the text a sense of its existence over time: the several ways in which 
          it has been interpreted and the way these interpretations have been contested.

            personal timidity and outworn feminine conventions of gentility getting 
            in the way of the national and personal project which he regarded as 
            needing more earthy openness, more sensuality.  His position was close

          the kind of direct attack other feminist writers such as Bunkle <i>et

          her ability at paraphrasing existing points of view that it is sometimes 
          difficult to locate her own authorial position.  In this, and in initiating 
          the process of constructing an historical framework for Robin Hyde criticism, 
          Paul’s intentions are postmodern: to examine the critical heritage as 
          a series of intersections between discourses.  Thus, Paul attempts to 
          reconstruct for the reader the assumptions behind the male orthodoxy which 
          Leggott and Bunkle <i>et al</i> identified in their work, without taking

            is valorised.  It seems that there is a prescription that the writer 
            needs to be obsessed with New Zealand to be driven to write well or 
            break through to a kind of truthfulness.  For the new generation the 
            idea of nation was creative because it was seen as a problem rather 
            than a solution, so that restlessness combined with the struggle to 
            express local and personal experience put a pressure on the individual

          detachment provides Paul with enough leverage to examine the tenets of 
          feminist readings of Hyde in the same manner as she does the cultural 
          nationalists.  Thus, she notes that “[i]nstead of seeing Hyde as a victim 
          of ‘booksy vulgarity’ and ‘guided by impulses she barely understood,’ 
          she was seen as sharp and self-aware, highly conscious of the problems 
          of being a woman and a writer”(135).   Paul’s concern here is over the 
          way in which “[t]he ‘involved’ feminist view reveals a wealth of ways 
          in which female experience constructs the work but it tends to categorise 
          the past in terms of the present.  It has the effect of reinforcing gender

          the existing tradition.  Her chapter “Robin Hyde: A Political Reading” 
          attempts to fill in the critical blanks she has identified.  Her project, 
          which she acknowledges as experimental, is to reconstruct Hyde as a figure 
          historically different from our own time, a writer whose focus was as 
          much on internationalism as nationalism, and one whose feminism was indebted 
          to that movement’s first wave.  Thus, argues Paul, we may read Hyde as

            were also used by writers central to the nationalist tradition.  But 
            Hyde’s particular use is best understood by relating her to overseas

          comparison with Hyde.  Her subsequent analysis of Hyde’s feminism prioritises 
          a point she considers is missing from early analyses: “There has not been 
          a simple continuity (or even a progressive advance) in women’s lives from 
          then to now”(170).  This assertion effectively deconstructs earlier feminist 
          attempts, both by Bunkle <i>et al</i> and by Leggott, to encode their 
          work and Hyde’s as part of a continuous, though chthonic, feminine tradition.  
          Through positing a view of women’s history, and the history of women’s 
          writing, as discontinuous and internally divided, Paul relieves of their 
          dialectical pressure those points at which Hyde’s views seem so different 
          from the present day:</font></p>

            of both wage-earning and poverty, as well as of supporting a child, 
            it seems that her primary concern was the economic inequality faced 
            by women, where later feminists have stressed “reproductive choice,” 
            often particularly choice <i>not </i>to have a child.  It also seems 
            as if she shared the common belief of her time that abortion was a sign 
            of general social failure.  A useful way of summing up her kind of 1930s 
            feminism, as compared to the feminisms of earlier and later women, would 
            be to say that for Hyde a woman needed not only the wherewithal to have 
            “a room of her own” (to think and write) but also the wherewithal to 
            have (and be able to take care of) a baby of her own.  (170)</font></p>

          </span>These points of difference and distance which Paul introduces between 
          Hyde’s time and our own are an important contribution to the Robin Hyde 
          critical tradition, as is the way in which Paul’s prose is self-consciously 
          reticent, making a case for authorial caution in a manner that lacks the 
          pomposity demonstrated by Bertram in his exposition of his own uncertainties 
          about Hyde.  Paul’s emphasis on the idea that “[e]vents have a different 
          significance at different times and thus are treated in different ways 
          by the people that they ‘happen to’”(178) is a timely redirection of the 
          trajectory of feminist readings of Hyde.  Such a historicisation of Hyde 
          as different from, as well as similar to, women and writers in our own 
          time, has a rebound effect in that it reminds the reader that readings 
          of Hyde are also historical and do not exist outside culture; not Leggott’s, 
          not Paul’s, nor my own reading.  Hyde, Paul claims, is “interested, not 
          so much in subjectivity for its own sake, but in sites where social ideologies 
          and forces were busy playing out their effects.  In the service of this 
          I have already suggested Hyde blurs documentary, journalism and fiction 
          so that her novels and poems spill out undefinably into the tide of ‘history’”(157).  
          My own analysis in my thesis, “Iris, Read and Written: A New Poetics of 
          Robin Hyde,” is necessarily more textually based than Paul’s, since it 
          deals with much material not so far discussed, and thus returns to the 
          notion of subjectivity, here presented in a reflexive relationship with 
          writing itself.  But Paul’s historical model has provided me with an important 
          counter to the temptation of analytical flights-of-fancy; in many ways 
          it is the “ballast” for Robin Hyde criticism that E.H. McCormick claimed 
          was absent from the “fantasy” of <i>Wednesday’s Children </i>(1940, 176).</font></p>

            Megan Clayton is a writer and academic and a native of Christchurch, 
            New Zealand, where she completed a PhD in New Zealand Literature at 
            the University of Canterbury in June 2001.  Her doctoral thesis, entitled 
            “Iris, Read and Written: A New Poetics of Robin Hyde,” reviews existing 
            critical approaches to the writing of Robin Hyde and proposes a new 
            Hydian poetics based on the concept of literary subjectivity, a fusion 
            of textual, contextual and subtextual concerns.  Megan Clayton teaches 
            New Zealand Studies to international students in the Foundation Studies 
            programme of the University of Canterbury, and is also a tutor of New 
            Zealand Literature in the University’s Department of English.</font></p>
