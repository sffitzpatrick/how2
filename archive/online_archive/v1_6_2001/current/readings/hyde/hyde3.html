        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Te-rerenga-wairua.” 
          The flying-off place of the spirits. A young man in Whangaroa told me 
          this was its proper name — New Zealand’s own Land’s End, beyond Spirits 
          Bay and Hector Macquarie’s funny little Pandora, beyond that bare country 
          from which the godwits make their yearly flight to Siberia.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Not 
          so very many people have been to the flying-off place. In Auckland it 
          was almost legendary, and even in Whangaroa, the Maoris, many of whom 
          had migrated from further north, spoke of Spirits Bay as a place a long 
          way off. But we were going, because of the same restlessness that drives 
          the godwits, when autumn is in the air again and the bush-fires start.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          road to Spirits Bay goes through Kaitaia, which is quite a town, with 
          more energy and enthusiasm about it — outwardly, anyhow — than any of 
          the other northern centres, Whangarei excepted.  Dargaville I remembered 
          as a quaint main street where there were gas-lamps, countless dogs, 
          and Maori boys wearing magenta blazers plus peppermint-pink berets. 
          Dargaville has electricity, and has gone in for brick and concrete. 
          It looks almost incongruously respectable; north, south, east and west 
          run the rambling northern roads, low bare hills either naked or massed 
          with manuka, sudden surprisingly tall and grand outcrops of black rock, 
          wooden houses quite isolated, built in the style of the ’eighties and 
          still possessing a few creaking old apple trees by their front verandahs, 
          and Maori cabins.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          ate fried fish, considerable quantities of fried fish: the rain slipped 
          down in a silvery drizzle, which bothered us, because the roads north 
          of Kaitaia were a complete mystery as far as we were concerned. But 
          a garage proprietor reassured us. There was a good clay road, all the 
          way up to Spirits Bay: a hotel at Houhora, if we wanted to sleep indoors: 
          and, if the tide was right, a fine run down Ninety-Mile Beach for our 
          trip home.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Can 
          we get right to the very edge? To Rerenga itself?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          garage proprietor scratched his head.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“There 
          used to be one of those rope and basket arrangements,” he said obscurely, 
          “Only the last time I was there – that would be twenty years back – 
          the rope looked as if it had been there for ever. Yes, that rope was 
          pretty near worn through.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Oh...we 
          can get near, though?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“If 
          you ride hosses.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sounded 
          a bit doubtful: my experience of hosses was negligible. However, never 
          do to-day what you can put off till to-morrow, planning included. Filled 
          with fish, we sank again into the motherly bosom of the Liz, and drove 
          on. A show-tent, with tags of red, white and blue climbing up a flagstaff, 
          fluttered patriotically at us as we started: somebody’s “Greatest Show 
          on Earth —See the Child Wonder.” Poor dears, in all that rain.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          the way, the mana of Allan Bell stands high among Maoris and others 
          in the north. It was he, they said, who made Kaitaia. One man told me 
          that if any white man had ever seen the godwits fly, it was Allan Bell. 
          Others have seen the great gatherings of birds, and the frequent false 
          starts, but Bell laid a regular plan of campaign, and is said to have 
          caught the godwits in the act. He died at Spirits Bay, and, like the 
          Maoris he loved, departed from Te-rerenga-wairua. It was explained to 
          me that the spirits wait until a great number of them are gathered together. 
          Then they travel along their last journey, and make the plunge in company. 
          And a female <i>taniwha </i>is said to follow their footsteps, but whether 
          she is there in friendly capacity, or waits like the monsters of an 
          Egyptian stream, nobody seemed to know. Fear of the spirits of the dead 
          must have been particularly strong in the north, for Edward Markham’s 
          journal says that the meaning of the name Ngapuhi — the name of the 
          great Hongi’s tribesmen, who were lords and masters here — is “Night-Goers.” 
          They alone were not afraid to travel about after dark, and because of 
          this were able to carry on surprise raids and attacks which helped to 
          put them in a position of supremacy.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Your 
          last little glimpse of semi-civilisation is Houhora, where the White 
          Pig still stands, the remnants of a glory. This was the gum-diggers’ 
          hotel, in the great days of high kauri gum prices, when Maoris and Dalmatians 
          might be digging with a titled Englishman alongside them in the swamps. 
          Dalmatian and Austrian people still live as far north as Te Kao, in 
          little weatherboard cabins like those of the Maoris. Two of them jumped 
          into the Liz for a lift of a few miles towards the sea: one had been 
          in New Zealand seven years, and couldn’t yet speak the language — proof 
          of the isolation of his life — and the older man, wrinkled, tanned like 
          mahogany, smiling and resigned, explained that he had come here twenty 
          years back. They both wanted to own land, but times were hard. Now that 
          gum prices were down among the dead men and dead markets, casual farm 
          labour was all that came their way.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          never saw a fat man or woman in the north: they may have been there, 
          I can only say that they weren’t conspicuous. The Maoris, about whose 
          health troubles so much has been written lately, are, whatever their 
          tuberculosis and infantile mortality rates may be, a distinguished-looking 
          and remarkably courteous type. If some Hollywood producer were filming 
          “Antony and Cleopatra,” and wanted a Cleopatra who wouldn’t chew gum 
          or roll her hips like a ship at sea, he could do a great deal worse 
          than seek among the Maoris for one of the straight-haired, high-cheekboned 
          slender girls of the north. We met, after dusk, with a carload of them, 
          stranded through an accident. Their ancient and dilapidated motor had 
          broken down: they had been trying all day to get a sick man to hospital. 
          They were quite quiet, strange brown figures with sad black eyes and 
          flowing black hair, like harmless witches.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          Maoris have an odd way of starting little roads among the manuka, roads 
          that look as if they meant business, and suddenly fade out, leaving 
          you beached, bogged and cursing. Half a dozen times we curved grandly 
          into the unmistakable road, only to find ourselves in a wilderness, 
          stalled, the Liz panting cruelly. And every time a polite Maori and 
          several little boys and girls came across, and gave us expert directions. 
          On the right side of midnight, with only a memory of Houhora’s few lights 
          and Te Kao’s little schoolhouse twinkling in our minds, we gave the 
          darkness best, and blew up the Lilos.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sleeping 
          in the manuka is good: I don’t vouch for it without the Lilos, because 
          one has to admit that the sharp little leaves prickle, and prickles 
          at 2 a.m. are apt to take romance out of any situation. But plus Lilos, 
          and a sprinkling of vague cold silver-daisy stars, and a wind blowing, 
          it is worthwhile.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the morning we drove on to Te Hapua, and had bacon, lots of bacon, not 
          to mention currant scones and jam, and beautifully amber tea, in a Maori 
          household where there were red amaryllis lilies on the breakfast table; 
          everyone was rather distressed about the recent newspapers’ stories 
          of Te Hapua’s degeneracy and disease. Plenty of mental vigour in that 
          house, anyhow, and plenty of commonsense: not to mention a brown-eyed 
          nine-year-old who sat on the balcony and played a Hawaiian guitar for 
          us. We saw the first glitter of white sands, over at Parenga. The sea 
          looked cold and choppy, and remembering the fuss the pakeha launch-owners 
          made about going beyond Whangaroa Heads if there’s the merest ripple 
          on the waters, I didn’t blame the Maoris for preferring to buy their 
          fish canned rather than turn out in ancient craft in all weathers. A 
          Maori health movement has been started in the vicinity of Te Hapua and 
          Te Kao: well, it has a foundation of real physical beauty and charm 
          to work upon, if the Maoris get their chance. The northern type is too 
          good to be wasted.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Clay 
          road to Te Paki: in boom days, Te Paki was a famous station, and even 
          now, as we drove past, it had the alert and up-to-date look of a big 
          farm where things are living and moving.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          raupo huts, quite empty, were Hector Macquarrie’s Pandora. I remember 
          he mentioned that even when inhabited, the little settlement was subject 
          to specially ardent and agile bugs, and now the bugs are monarch of 
          all they survey, I hate to think how many of them must be flourishing 
          there. An ancient black and white cow — the original one that jumped 
          over the moon — tossed her horns at us skittishly. We walked on over 
          the glistening white sandhills.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">White 
          sandhills: bleached, clean, silvery white, white as the moon, moulded 
          in windswept curves and fine ribbed patterns, stretching away down a 
          coast of foam, as far as one can see: and tearing in to meet the sand, 
          two diagonal lines of surf, clashing together a hundred yards from shore, 
          spouting up, a great creamy mass.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          are things to be seen in New Zealand, but nothing else that gives the 
          thrill of that lonely surf at Spirits Bay. The solitude is complete. 
          Nothing lies in sight but the miles of shining white sand, birds flaking 
          up and down on a light wind, the surflines pouring into one another, 
          the sea speaking with a massive voice, and out against the rocks great 
          pillars of foam lifting into the air. It is not a sad place, but a startling 
          one, this Spirits Bay; and wherever the waves have crashed through the 
          centuries, they have pounded and broken millions of little gleaming 
          shells, biscuit and heliotrope, so that you walk on a beach of purple 
          and gold, shining with salt. There is no vegetation but the paraha vine, 
          that used to be used for wrapping up the bodies thrown into the ovens 
          at cannibal feasts: it’s a delicate, wind-trembling little flower that 
          doesn’t know its own sinister history. Its mauve bells are like silk. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">That 
          is all, except that the spirits of the Maori dead did rightly to come 
          to Spirits Bay: it is a magnificent place, Te-rerenga-wairua.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          had given up the hosses: in the first place, I didn’t feel confident 
          of controlling one of these temperamental beasts for eight miles (which 
          was the distance onwards to the very last bit of New Zealand), and in 
          the second, so far as we could see, there weren’t any available. So, 
          inaccessible by those few miles, the last cliff and rock, and the cape 
          Tasman saw, lay unassaulted, and I made up my mind to go back again, 
          perhaps in winter when the big storms would be towering here, and look 
          over the edge.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the meantime, Ninety-Mile Beach; the exhilarating snow-white desert 
          on your left, the exhilarating snow-white surf on your right, and between 
          them, a beautiful sweep of firm, iron-coloured, unflawed sand.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
          had just agreed that “The Sheikh,” “The Garden of Allah,” “Belladonna,” 
          “Beau Geste,” every desert picture ever filmed, could have been made 
          and better made, in this snowy and picturesquely curved desert of New 
          Zealand’s very own, when up the sands came a wave. It did no more than 
          take a look under the bonnet of the Liz, and then retreated. The Liz 
          stopped.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          little gentle cursing from behind the wheel; but it was all right. The 
          Liz, coaxed and blarneyed, agreed to start again.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Five 
          hundred yards further on, the Liz stopped once more.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          time, it took action. We were rather expert about it. We dragged out 
          a large tarpaulin from the car, spread it before the wheels, like Sir 
          Walter Raleigh’s cloak before Queen Elizabeth's red slippers and shoved 
          pieces of driftwood under the rear wheels. After that, I lay in a graceful 
          attitude shoving the car from behind, and wishing that just for one 
          perilous minute I had the girth of the fat lady in a circus. The Liz 
          muttered and argued, then suddenly hiccupped, and was off, leaving me 
          picking myself up from wet sand.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Wouldn’t 
          it be better to turn back?” I suggested. I didn’t want to turn back: 
          nobody, once having set wheel on Ninety-Mile Beach, could conceivably 
          want to turn back. The seagulls would sneer so, and the breakers shout 
          such loud hoarse laughter among themselves, as they come rolling up 
          the beach. We didn’t turn back.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About 
          fifteen miles from Spirits Bay, the Liz did it again. This time it was 
          serious. The tide had turned, and was just coming in. Not a soul, not 
          a tyre-track, had been visible from first to last. We once saw a goat, 
          which sprinted away without uttering any helpful suggestions. We ought 
          to have milked it, of course. We hadn’t eaten since breakfast at Te 
          Hapua: but this was no time to bandy suggestions about food, or even 
          drink. Action, more action... </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          like to think of the next three hours. When I am an old woman, and have 
          kept all my dependents running about like beetles waiting upon me hand 
          and foot, I'll still like to think of them. They were action...</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          Liz had sunk in a lopsided, ungainly way on her seaward side. Her tyres 
          were down eight inches in a mixture of sand and water, which even as 
          we gazed became soupier and soupier. I was told to go comb the beach 
          for driftwood — not matchwood, but heavy stuff — and departed. I found 
          a place where several casks and apparently a vessel also had come to 
          grief. There was plenty of sea-washed plank timber, also logs; large, 
          fat, knobbly logs, the happy home of countless bugs and beetles. I started 
          to haul them.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          was no comment, no verbal reward, except an occasional terse, “Get some 
          more wood...Hurry, she’s going down again.” The car, jacked up in front, 
          rose beautifully: our little tower of driftwood fitted in underneath, 
          we wiped sweating brows and said, “That’s got her.” Liz objected: she 
          wobbled for a moment, then crashed.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Hell,” 
          said a dreadful voice. Then, “It’s about forty miles to Kaitaia. I’ll 
          have to walk. You will stay here.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“But 
          Liz?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“The 
          tide will cover Liz to her bonnet. Can’t be helped.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Insurance?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Yes. 
          But they’ll probably blame me. They’ll point out that reason and De 
          Witts’ Almanac and the meteorological’s office all said it wasn’t right 
          to do Ninety-Mile with the tide on the turn. They’ll argue, and they 
          won’t pay out in full. This will probably mean a hundred gone west.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“It 
          seems funny to think there is so much money.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Well, 
          couldn’t you get some more driftwood, instead of standing there?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Oh, 
          driftwood…”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Besides 
          bugs, some of it had rusty nails; I’ll probably die of blood-poisoning, 
          I thought, and wondered whether I really wanted the Liz to be saved, 
          or whether it wouldn’t be glorious to spend a night alone by those gigantic 
          booming waves, with a huge driftwood fire. Nothing to eat, except a 
          little marching chocolate and toheroas — if I could catch the toheroas, 
          and if toheroas are bearable raw — but still, fun; however, a hundred 
          pounds is a hundred pounds.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          was told to stop hauling driftwood logs, and make channels in the sand, 
          letting the water seep away from the wheels. Hauling driftwood was a 
          fool to this.  The more industriously I channelled, the better the water 
          seeped. I felt like a beaver, and the tide came in.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Can’t 
          jack her any higher. Where’s the tarpaulin?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sir 
          Walter Raleigh’s cloak went down before and under the car once more. 
          I looked at my blistered hands and thought, “Of course it won’t start. 
          At midnight to-night, I’ll be sitting in front of a driftwood fire, 
          eating toheroas and wishing they were steak.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
          started. It was a somehow glorious moment, a triumph of mankind over 
          the sheer, dumbheaded, reasonless, bulldoggy, big-Swede obstinacy of 
          the machine. She slid the length of the tarpaulin, gasped, hesitated, 
          and made the higher sand, where the water didn’t seep. I looked back 
          at my pile of driftwood, and thought, “Good-bye, fire.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
          that nothing mattered any more. A happy voice said at intervals, “There’s 
          chocolate under that flap,” “Look in the back seat and I think you’ll 
          find the glasses,” “Look, those people are digging toheroas – want to 
          get out and take a look?” I didn’t care what toheroas they dug, though 
          later we had a dozen wrapped up in batter and tossed into fritters — 
          can be recommended. But there wasn’t anything real except a few blurred 
          faces, Maori and white — the huge surfs pounding in, white plumes in 
          their hair — a beetle dropping off his driftwood home and beating it 
          away, for the lick of his life, into sands that are whiter, shapelier, 
          lonelier than anything filmed at Hollywood.</font></p>
