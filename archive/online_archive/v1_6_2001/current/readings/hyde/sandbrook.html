        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          is the inscription on the flyleaf of the brand new copy of <i>The Godwits 
          Fly</i> that Robin Hyde sent to Gilbert Tothill, the psychiatrist whom 
          she had also regarded as her mentor and friend. When she wrote the words 
          she was half a world away, broke but writing hard; battered and ill as 
          a consequence of months spent at the battle-front in China resisting Japanese 
          invasion. She was still pitching all she had into the cause of humanity 
          and justice as Europe too slid towards war; and about to cross swords 
          with some hard-nosed English play producers over terms for a script she 
          was just then completing. Four months later, at 33 years of age, she would 
          be dead—of “benzedrine poisoning and suicide while of an unsound mind”(<i>A 
          Home</i>, xx. But at that moment in the northern spring of 1939, she held 
          success in her hand).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gilbert 
          Tothill’s copy of <i>The Godwits Fly, </i>held in the Auckland City Library’s 
          archives, was donated by him in 1965. Its inscription, “This imperfect 
          part of truth,” still gestures towards the things about a life that have 
          to go unsaid—or that can only be understood imperfectly by those who haven’t 
          lived through them. They are like the knowledge that war veterans cannot 
          put into words. Hyde had glimpsed that painful knowledge in Starkie and 
          his generation and written it into <i>Passport to Hell; </i>she had lived 
          her own hell in the war zone of China in 1938 and recorded it in <i>Dragon 
          Rampant. </i>The same kind of knowledge dwells in the contours of the 
          “steep blue country of melancholy” as they appear in this novel. Eliza 
          Hannay’s experience of loss and alienation is a terrain familiar to Hyde 
          herself and to Tothill, who had been with her on part of her own journey 
          through it. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Robin 
          Hyde had recovered her mental health and self-esteem under the care of 
          Dr Tothill and his colleague Dr Buchanan after a breakdown in 1933. On 
          1 June she had jumped off an Auckland wharf in a desperate rejection of 
          a mentality and a set of circumstances that had made her life not worth 
          living. Fished out, she was put in Auckland Hospital’s DT (delirium tremens) 
          cells, had a rebellious and unhappy period at Avondale Mental Hospital 
          and then left Auckland briefly under her mother’s care. From Wellington 
          she went to Northland then back to Auckland where she appeared in court 
          in early December to face a charge for the suicide attempt. The next day 
          she collapsed again in the middle of a busy street and begged to be taken 
          back to Avondale Hospital where she was admitted as a voluntary patient 
          to the Lodge.  There her condition improved; she gradually rediscovered 
          the power to write and began to forge new terms on which to live. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          impulse to write directly about her own experience led Hyde first to produce 
          an autobiography, which she completed in 1934 for Tothill. About a year 
          later she returned to the subject of the intimate course of her own life 
          and wrote <i>The Godwits Fly</i>. Getting the story down as she wanted 
          it to be was a long, hard struggle, involving rewriting the draft, thinking 
          and reading about style and authorial control, and seeking advice from 
          friends. By the time it was finished two years later, she felt she had 
          succeeded in representing human experience meaningfully and honestly using 
          the pattern and texture—“imperfect parts” though they were—of her own 
          individual life. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          main elements of Hyde’s life have been described in a number of other 
          places, but for readers encountering her work for the first time, the 
          main outline is as follows. Iris Wilkinson (Hyde’s real name) was born 
          on 19 January 1906 in Capetown. Her parents moved to New Zealand shortly 
          after she was born, the second of four daughters, and she was raised in 
          Wellington. While at Wellington Girls’ College she gained local notice 
          as a poet.  From about the age of fifteen she also knew a young man named 
          Harry Sweetman.  She fell deeply in love with him and dreamed of a shared 
          life of travel and adventure. Her strong attachment to Harry endured, 
          even though it was mixed with bitter disappointment when he set off alone 
          for England, where he died shortly afterwards.  She became a career journalist, 
          working during the 1920s and 1930s on the <i>Dominion</i> in Wellington, 
          the Christchurch <i>Sun</i>, <i>NZ Truth</i>, the <i>Wanganui Chronicle</i> 
          and the <i>New Zealand Observer</i> in Auckland. She also had freelance 
          articles, stories and poems published widely in newspapers and magazines 
          throughout New Zealand, in Australia and Britain. She earned respect as 
          a hard-working and independent-minded journalist. She was inquisitive 
          about what made her culture tick—sharply observant about the position 
          of women, prepared to get actively involved in radical politics and economic 
          debate at a time when New Zealand—and the rest of the world—was gripped 
          by Depression, aware of taha Maori and informed about international politics.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span>[3]</span></a> 
          By the mid-1930s Hyde was also an accomplished poet of the new generation 
          and a novelist of great promise. </font></p>
         
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
          a personal level, her life was difficult and tragic. An injury to her 
          knee in 1924 left her lame and in the long course of medical treatment 
          she began a dependence on drugs that persisted to the end of her life. 
          There were two unwed pregnancies; the first baby (Robin) died at birth 
          in Sydney when she was 20, the second (Derek) born four years later had 
          to be provided for discreetly. The experience of motherhood with its complex 
          economic and emotional pressures also took a toll of grief and anguish. 
          Unmarried motherhood stigmatised her socially, strained family and other 
          relationships and threatened to undermine her chances of a steady career 
          in the respectable world of work.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
          was driven to reckless forms of behaviour. Two breakdowns were followed 
          by periods of convalescence, first in Hanmer in 1927, then from 1933 to 
          early 1937 as a voluntary patient at the Lodge (she invariably referred 
          to it as ‘The Grey Lodge’) a residential clinic attached to Auckland Mental 
          Hospital in Avondale. In the relative security and serenity of these surroundings 
          her creativity flourished. From her time at Hanmer had come poetry; from 
          her attic room in the Lodge came a torrent of poetry, autobiography, novels, 
          stories and plays. <i>The Godwits Fly</i> is part of this extraordinary 
          burst of activity in 1934–35 that gave rise to almost half of her total 
          output of creative writing. As she regained health, she was able to come 
          and go more freely from the Lodge and get involved in the social and literary 
          life of Auckland. She became a well-known figure in the town and kept 
          in close touch with the current scene. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          1936 the Depression was over and the national economy was rebuilding. 
          A Labour government had swept to power in November 1935 with a fresh vision 
          for New Zealand’s economy, society and place in the world. The local literary 
          establishment was feeling confident too, and was already forging monuments 
          to itself. There was a New Zealand Authors’ Week held in April and plans 
          were already being laid for New Zealand’s Centennial to be celebrated 
          in 1940. Younger writers did not have much of the limelight—Hyde was invited 
          to speak at Authors’ Week only at the last minute—but they were stimulated 
          by the issues nevertheless. There was a good deal of talk in the air about 
          the Great New Zealand Novel and other prodigies. Hyde celebrated that 
          energy and innovation in an article for <i>Art in New Zealand</i>, seeing 
          great potential in the emerging talents of her own generation. Poet and 
          personality Rex Fairburn, for example, whom she knew and admired from 
          their period of common interest in Douglas Social Credit in the early 
          1930s, might be able to combine his radical politics with the energy and 
          power of his exceptional lyric gift to produce “the New Zealand novel 
          about which New Zealanders still moan.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span>[4]</span></a> 
          The prediction was also a challenge to produce the goods—and it was directed 
          at herself as much as at Fairburn and their contemporaries. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          was optimistic about her own chances of achieving recognition as a clear 
          and strong voice for her generation, as she set to work to revise and 
          complete<i> The</i> <i>Godwits Fly</i> in the winter of 1936. She felt 
          she was writing with maturity and discipline. <i>Journalese </i>(1934) 
          had already been published locally by the National Printing Co. in Auckland, 
          but her big break had come when Macmillan’s of London accepted <i>The 
          Conquerors </i>(1935)<i>,</i> her second book of poems, as part of their 
          prestigious Modern Poets series. Shortly after, <i>Passport to Hell</i> 
          (1936) was taken by the English publisher, Hurst and Blackett. Now she 
          was an international writer with a literary agent in London; and publishers 
          wanted more of her work. <i>Wednesday’s Children</i> would soon appear 
          under Hurst and Blackett’s imprint and they also had a collection of her 
          short stories called “Unicorn Pasture” for consideration (though it was 
          not subsequently published). America was in her sights too. <i>Check to 
          Your King</i>, the product of her ground-breaking research in Sir George 
          Grey’s sprawling archives, had been submitted for a competition run by 
          the <i>Atlantic Monthly </i>and was commended by the judges. </font></p>
        <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Could 
          <i>The Godwits Fly</i> now put her firmly on the literary world map? Was 
          the “schoolgirl poetess” of six years earlier, with two slim volumes of 
          verse from a small corner of the world about to hit the trans-Atlantic 
          big-time? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
          readied herself for greater independence. As a kind of trial flight, she 
          made several short stays away from the Lodge on the North Shore and elsewhere, 
          then a much longer trip in September to Dunedin and on to other parts 
          of the country. But it was a complex set of events and motivations that 
          finally prompted her to leave the Lodge altogether in early 1937. Now 
          there was a difficult year of living precariously from her writing on 
          the North Shore in Auckland before she left New Zealand on 18 January, 
          the day before her thirty-second birthday. In Hong Kong she abandoned 
          her intended trans-Siberian trip to Europe and went instead into war-torn 
          China. Months later she travelled on to England but by a different route. 
          New work was being published in England and she carried works in progress 
          with her. Still writing prolifically, but now seriously ill and relying 
          on friends for cheap lodgings much of the time, she survived in and around 
          London for about a year. Then on 23 August 1939, as Europe too stood at 
          the brink before plunging to its destruction in world war, Iris Wilkinson 
          took her own life.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          decade before, Hyde had written to Harry Sweetman’s brother, Hardy, advising 
          him to “Paint your own dreams—of a life short as you like but vivid”(29 
          May 1928). The advice was her manifesto and perhaps her requiem: a determination—almost 
          a desperation—to make every moment count.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><font size="3">An 
          individual living in the world</font></b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How 
          are we to read Hyde’s life in relation to her fiction? Since her death, 
          almost every one of the publications of her work has had biographical 
          information attached to it by its editor. As a result Hyde has always 
          been “present” alongside the work itself, like another character, needing 
          to be read into our understanding of the fiction in some way. Boddy and 
          Matthews’s approach in <i>Disputed Ground </i>is an interesting example. 
          Where they had no other available information, they incorporated events 
          and descriptions directly from <i>The Godwits Fly</i> into their biographical 
          essay on Hyde to produce the most directly biographical reading of the 
          novel to date. Other readers have had a variety of reactions. Some have 
          been passionate admirers. Some have wanted to read about her life with 
          less indirectness; others have reacted to her “hysteria” and “lack of 
          control”; still others have not been able to find their expectations about 
          fiction readily fulfilled because of their sense of the writer’s active 
          presence.  The prevailing critical taste after her death was also unfavourable 
          to her writing. A new definition of New Zealand’s “high culture” was being 
          forged in the post-war years of the late 1940s and 1950s. A modernist 
          style and national themes were the vogue, cast in small, highly crafted 
          forms—lyric poems and short stories—preferably with the artist, as in 
          James Joyce’s words, “invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, 
          paring his fingernails.” Looking back across the war years as a divide 
          of time and sensibility, Curnow, Bertram, Brasch and other priests of 
          the high culture had little sympathy or space for other ways of framing 
          experience. Hyde was problematic: she wrote “too much” and in unsettled 
          forms; her sense of “New Zealandness” was too prone to fuse and interlock 
          with the supra-national, the mythical and the archaic; her “life” bled 
          through into her “art.” She was considered as a specimen of an unsuccessful 
          branch on the tree of New Zealand’s cultural evolution, and was bypassed.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span>[5]</span></a></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
          a considerable period, her work remained largely unknown and unread. <i>The 
          Godwits Fly</i>, in print continuously since 1970, has in fact been the 
          most available point of access for readers, apart from the selective glimpses 
          offered by the poems included in various anthologies. Then in the 1980s, 
          there was a remarkable recovery of her other writing. Bridget Armstrong’s 
          solo drama <i>The Flight of the Godwit</i> (1982) was the prelude to a 
          burst of renewed interest in her spectacular and tragic life story.<a
  href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span>[6]</span></a> In a span of less 
          than ten years following Armstrong’s solo dramatisation, Hyde’s work achieved 
          a publishing prominence matched by no other literary figure of her generation. 
          All of her known prose work was brought forward from the 1930s to a new 
          audience and a new critical climate; together with enough fresh information 
          about her life, the depth and range of her writing and her creative process 
          to re-make her place in the national literature.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          unique feature of Hyde’s work is that a significant amount of previously 
          unknown work has appeared long after her death, alongside the re-published 
          texts, and much more is yet to be published. There is still a remarkable 
          freshness to the work as well. Her nonconformity in matters of genre and 
          style—considered odd or perverse in her own time—now reads as a rich and 
          insightful engagement with ways of inscribing experience and opening up 
          the text.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span>[7]</span></a> 
          The collection of articles, reviews and social commentary in <i>Disputed 
          Ground</i> re-contextualised her non-fiction writing. Completely “new” 
          works by Hyde have included <i>A Home in This World </i>and<i> The Book 
          of Nadath</i>, both of which show new facets of her work and also invite 
          a re-reading of the previously known canon. Other unpublished work comprises 
          more poems, autobiography, almost a hundred short stories, half a dozen 
          plays, the verse chronicle “De Thierry’s Progress,” a novel called “The 
          Unbelievers” and the incomplete start of at least one other called “Come 
          Away, O Human Child.” Yet other of Hyde’s teeming offspring are missing, 
          presumed lost: novels called “The Windy House”(1929), and “These Poor 
          Old Hands”(1935); and the playscript based on <i>Wednesday’s Children</i>.(1939) 
          A considerable body of letters, journals and other evidence of Hyde’s 
          life and craft also remains to be fully explored. Academic research interest 
          is growing both within New Zealand and beyond. A biography and a Collected 
          Poems are currently in preparation. Filmmakers and screenwriters continue 
          to be drawn to the dramatic possibilities of her writing. We haven’t heard 
          the last of Hyde yet.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Each 
          of the new editions and new texts has been accompanied by further insights 
          into the writing, its context and its authorship. The availability of 
          more information about both Hyde’s personal life and her writing career 
          has stimulated exploration of the political, social and literary tensions 
          at work in them. Feminist and post-modernist ways of reading the literature 
          and the life have contested the older modernist approach—though at their 
          most reactive such readings have risked simply privileging Hyde for the 
          same marginality that had caused her to be disregarded in the cultural 
          construct of the “Curnow generation.” Pondering that literary-historical 
          about-face, Mary Paul offers a useful corrective in her reminder that 
          the work needs careful reading, not special pleading. “To understand Hyde’s 
          narratives only for their pathos is to reduce their significance . . . 
          Hyde wanted a new way of showing an individual living in the world, and 
          at the same time of questioning the boundaries of self and world. [She 
          was] interested, not so much in subjectivity for its own sake, but in 
          sites where social ideologies and forces were busy playing out their effects”(<i>Her 
          Side of the Story</i>, 174, 157).  <i>The Godwits Fly</i> is one such 
          site.</font></p>

          The title of the novel had evidently been the first thing Hyde decided 
          on. Rawlinson, looking through Hyde’s papers, noted the “sudden” decision 
          recorded in her journal 2 March 1935: “Settled: I’m going to write a faintly 
          autobiographical novel called ‘The Godwits Fly’”(Rawlinson, intro. to 
          <i>Godwits,</i> xiii–xiv). Joan Stevens is representative of critical 
          opinion in passing lightly over the godwit theme. Instead she preferred 
          the Mansfieldian depiction of “crystalline impressions of childhood days” 
          in the first half of the novel, adding: “Unfortunately, the adult portion 
          of the book is less effective, distorted possibly by its intimate relation 
          to her own life”(Stevens, intro. to <i>Check</i>,<i> ix</i>). Rawlinson 
          took the same view (Rawlinson, xi, xvi–xvii).  More recently Stuart Murray 
          is also equivocal: Hyde is “clearly a successor to Mansfield’s analysis 
          of an emerging settler society,” he says, supporting this with some of 
          the major correspondences between<i> The Godwits Fly</i> and Mansfield’s 
          New Zealand stories in <i>never a soul at home </i>(1998) (189). He finds 
          Hyde unable to sustain fully realised characters in the larger form of 
          the novel, however. Timothy Cardew he sees as a “stock character”: “the 
          decade’s composite poet/tramp/scholar.” In his view, that Timothy should 
          “command such an investment on Eliza’s part unbalances the novel, and 
          Hyde struggles in particular to find an adequate ending to this narrative”(Murray,<i> 
          </i>192). These readers’ presumption that the novel is to be read primarily 
          as a picture of childhood in suburban Wellington leaves a great deal unexplained. 
          The key to avoiding reductiveness is the godwit motif itself, which needs 
          a more complex reading. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          herself draws attention to things that are <i>wrong</i> with the godwit 
          motif, in the Author’s Foreword. First: “many people do not know what 
          a godwit is.” Then “godwits, flying north, never go near England.  They 
          fly to Siberia.” Finally, having flown away, “logically . . . they ought 
          to have the same compulsion to come back.”   The Foreword offers no easy 
          resolution of these difficulties. But by deliberately confronting us with 
          the fact that the literal migration of the godwits is not a good fit with 
          the events of the novel, Hyde is suggesting that we read with our wits 
          about us. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Taken 
          most directly, the godwit’s flight is intended to be read as a metaphor 
          for an emerging post-colonial state of mind. It depicts the “white” New 
          Zealanders’ (as she called them elsewhere) “Colonial England-hunger,” 
          or over-easy reliance for cultural sustenance on their stock of canned 
          and preserved culture, imported from Europe—and past its “use by” date—which 
          had retarded their effort to cultivate more wholesome homegrown forms. 
          The lack of a sense of community in contemporary New Zealand society had 
          already emerged as a theme in <i>Journalese</i>, written just a year or 
          so before she began <i>The Godwits Fly:</i> “If society consists of a 
          body of individuals with some real tie of feeling between them, we have 
          no society in New Zealand as yet: there are ties of prejudice and self-interest, 
          but of genuine feeling, no” (<i>Journalese</i>, 113).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          But that tricky Foreword also clues us in to look at Eliza’s emerging 
          powers of thought and action rather than simply the idea of a geographical 
          journey to England or even an exploration of social themes. In the novel 
          Eliza realises that it is “ourselves we reach out for, our own undiscovered 
          selves”<i>(Godwits</i>, 137). To be a godwit in these terms is to go in 
          search of oneself; a search which is without end, since the self is in 
          part defined by the journey it makes—as the godwit is defined by its endless, 
          instinctive migrations around the world. </font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
          Godwits Fly</i> was the novel that Hyde re-worked most extensively of 
          all her prose writing. Evidence of her creative process remains in the 
          collections of her manuscripts and archives; and these traces provide 
          insight into how she worked and how <i>The Godwits Fly </i>came to be 
          in its present form<i>.</i><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span>[8]</span></a> 
          The Hyde archives are physically disparate, and much remains to be done 
          to establish bibliographical coherence among the various collections. 
          Other lost pieces of the puzzle may yet come to light. Looking at the 
          <i>Godwits</i> material, we can partially resolve the interrelationships 
          of the surviving fragmentary drafts but questions inevitably remain because 
          of that fragmentation. Bearing these limitations in mind, the following 
          is a brief outline of the novel’s construction. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          had written the autobiography for Tothill in 1934, about a year before 
          she began on <i>The Godwits Fly</i>. The broad outline of the “faintly 
          autobiographical” <i>Godwits </i>was clear in her mind from having written 
          the earlier text. The First Version (as Rawlinson named it) was written 
          quickly and evidently with very little in the way of planning or other 
          preamble before the 2 March journal entry: “Settled: I’m going to write 
          a faintly autobiographical novel called ‘The Godwits Fly’. . . . telling 
          about the Colonial England hunger, and they that depart, and they that 
          stay at home – Girl to be called Eliza Hannay, God knows why – But there 
          she is – Like me but very much pleasanter and I think a sense of humour 
          would be a help.” A week or so later Hyde was at chapter four, but then 
          she paused for about six weeks to write <i>Passport to Hell.</i>  By 12 
          May the <i>Godwits</i> draft was finished. In the space of about four 
          weeks’ writing time, in the attic at Avondale, she had completed 300 pages. 
          But she was unhappy with the result and put it aside for further reflection 
          (Rawlinson, xi–xii). This typescript is still substantially complete, 
          though it lacks a title page and possibly an Introduction. It is currently 
          located partly in Challis’s collection (261 pages) and partly in the Auckland 
          University Library collection (38 pages). The story is structured in two 
          parts.  While the title page of the first Part is missing, a separate 
          title page for Part Two is headed “Success” but then crossed out by Hyde 
          and in her hand renamed “The Middle Distance.” As well as this structural 
          division, the First Version has significant differences in arrangement 
          and treatment from the later drafts.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          wrote prolifically after she had put <i>Godwits </i>aside.  Between 12 
          May 1935, when the First Version was finished, and the autumn of 1936 
          she produced an abundance of poems, short stories and articles as well 
          as re-writing <i>Check to Your King</i> and working on three other novels: 
          “These Poor Old Hands,” “The Unbelievers” (both still unpublished) and 
          <i>Wednesday’s Children</i>. Images, incidents, themes and stylistic approaches 
          from the First Version recur in various ways in these other works. Letters 
          from this time and passages in her journal and notebooks show her actively 
          experimenting with ways to overcome the problems that had left her dissatisfied 
          with <i>Godwits. </i>Then, in a letter dated 8 May 1936, Hyde told John 
          A. Lee she had begun redrafting <i>The Godwits Fly.</i> </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          had spurred her to action? Finishing other work, particularly <i>Wednesday’s 
          Children, </i>left her desk clear. External events such as the April 1936 
          Authors’ Week also energised her with the feeling that the moment was 
          right to gain from a broadening public interest in local writers and themes. 
          Lee’s own <i>Children of the Poor</i> impressed her as a model of fictionalised 
          autobiography. But probably more personal pressures dictated that she 
          would now turn her attention to the autobiographical novel, in preference 
          to the many projects she either had started or had in mind. There is for 
          instance a long description in her journal on 13 March 1936 of the emotions 
          recalled by a letter received years before from Harry Sweetman, when she 
          visited the family home in Wellington at Christmas. The letter made ghosts 
          walk: “Twelve pages of it and tonight lying next to my heart! If that 
          seems childish, so was he—he had a curl of my hair, and says in the letter 
          that to sleep without it gave him nightmarish dreams.” It is strong emotions 
          like these that may have been the driving energy that took the novel in 
          a new direction. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          returned to work on the novel in April 1936. Dialogue at this time with 
          her closest friend, Gwen Mitcalfe (née Hawthorn), seems to have helped 
          her to rethink the novel’s approach and in particular to focus on the 
          relationships between Eliza, Simone and Timothy. It was this focus, and 
          the playing out of the events of Eliza’s “21st year,” which was the “breakthrough” 
          to resolving her dissatisfaction with the form and structure of the First 
          Version.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Major 
          changes to the First Version were the result. She removed an extensive 
          treatment of Augusta’s godwit journey before Eliza is born. She rounded 
          out John Hannay’s character—he had been killed off at the beginning of 
          the First Version. Other friends of Eliza’s, who competed with Simone’s 
          characterisation in importance, also disappeared. Most importantly, the 
          final third of the novel was reshaped to remove both interpretative comments 
          on the society and politics of the day, and an account of Eliza as a successful 
          journalist travelling and working around New Zealand, living in Christchurch, 
          visiting the Marlborough Sounds and the Wanganui river valley and other 
          events. Other characters—a travelling companion called Hildred, Marlborough 
          residents, a spiritualist called Shadow—were also removed from the novel. 
          Hyde also abandoned the (literally) “cliff-hanger” ending of the First 
          Version, which has Eliza drive off the road to avoid hitting a mob of 
          sheep as she contemplates a destination either at a lonely farm called 
          “Solitude” or at Spirits Bay in Northland.<a href="#_edn9"
  name="_ednref9" title=""><span>[9]</span></a> Part of her dissatisfaction with 
          the First Version may have been that so much of the lived experience in 
          the novel was displaced onto other characters or handled obliquely, leaving 
          Eliza’s character weakly motivated.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          is no surviving complete draft of <i>Godwits </i>from this period; but 
          there are some fragments of typescript. Specifically, there is a 40-page 
          typescript of the “Little Ease” chapter (AU-B12b, fragments 1, 2) and 
          another collection of 81 pages of typescript in the Challis collection 
          of episodes corresponding to the beginning of Part Two of the First Version. 
          These are distinctive in having handwritten annotations by both Hyde and 
          her friend Gwen Mitcalfe.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"
  title=""><span>[10]</span></a> Mitcalfe was the person on whom Simone is based 
          in the novel and these passages are the ones involving Simone and Timothy 
          most directly. This is the only case where anyone other than Hyde herself 
          worked directly on the actual drafts of <i>The Godwits Fly</i> as it was 
          being composed. It is evidence that Hyde sought Mitcalfe’s advice and 
          that these passages of the novel at least were receiving particular attention. 
          Further work remains to be done to determine the exact date and compositional 
          order of these “Simone” passages; but most likely they are from May–June 
          1936, when Hyde was recasting the novel in a significantly new shape.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          other surviving materials from this period are two notebooks containing, 
          among much else, handwritten notes and drafts for the novel. Rawlinson 
          ordered and named these Exercise Book 14 (Ex 14) and Exercise Book 15 
          (Ex 15). The Ex 15 notebook of about 100 pages contains a total of 11 
          pages of notes and a list of chapter titles for the novel. Hyde dated 
          one of these pages “July 22nd 1936.” One end of Ex 15 starts with the 
          13 March journal entry, quoted above, and a group of poems. Ex 14 includes 
          a redraft of part of the text. She was evidently working in both Ex 14 
          and Ex 15 at the same time; and old themes were taking a new focus. <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          outline chapter list and “phrase shorthand” notes in Ex 15 are very close 
          to the sequence of the First Version, suggesting that these plans at least 
          are from very early in the revision. Interestingly, this Ex 15 outline 
          gives the novel a three-part structure. This may be the moment at which 
          Hyde went back to the typescript of the First Version, crossed out the 
          Part Two title “Success” and replaced it with “The Middle Distance,” which 
          implies a third Part to come. But the idea of a three-part structure was 
          not pursued. In fact, the whole idea of splitting the story into parts 
          was dropped after this point, possibly because such internal divisions 
          are at odds with the thematic concern for unity and integration.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          next stage in the development of the novel is a manuscript draft (which 
          I have called MS version) that survives in an almost complete form, spread 
          across three more notebooks in the Challis collection (Ex 16, Ex 17, Ex 
          18). This draft establishes the final shape of the novel, though there 
          is still a great deal of detailed change to be made to the text and to 
          the chapter divisions and titles between this and the final published 
          version. The MS version lacks the first two chapters (and possibly an 
          Introduction or Author’s Foreword), which must have existed either as 
          loose pages or in another notebook. There is also a chapter and a half 
          missing between the last two notebooks.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is unusual for Hyde to have handwritten a revision of such a long work. 
          She commonly worked directly onto her typewriter. She must have worked 
          from an earlier typescript however, since large parts of this text follow 
          word for word passages in the revised sections of the First Version. One 
          reason why this draft was handwritten is that Hyde was working on it while 
          she was away from the Lodge, perhaps on weekend stays with friends in 
          Auckland at first, then while travelling further afield.<a href="#_edn12"
  name="_ednref12" title=""><span>[12]</span></a> She went from Auckland to Dunedin 
          by train in late September 1936, staying in a boarding house on George 
          Street in Dunedin and spending time as the guest of the Hon. W. Downie 
          Stewart, writing in the tranquillity of a balcony in his house on Heriot 
          Row. The first of this set of notebooks containing the draft of <i>Godwits 
          </i>also contains notes made in the Hocken Library and notes of discussions 
          with Stewart himself about political history.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span>[13]</span></a> 
          There is also material about Charles de Thierry in this notebook, suggesting 
          that Hyde had first used it before she left Auckland and while she was 
          at work on <i>Check to Your King</i>, which she had completed in 1935. 
          It is possible therefore that the MS version was begun before Hyde set 
          out for Dunedin. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          There is no known complete draft of the novel after the MS Version. There 
          is, however, the first 137 pages of a typescript draft, which currently 
          exists as two fragments, each in a separate collection. The first, of 
          49 pages, is in the Auckland University Library (AU-B12b fragment 1); 
          the other, of 84 pages, in the Challis collection. This partial draft 
          appears to belong to the revision made over the summer of 1936–37.  While 
          it is possible that it is the remains of a full late typescript draft 
          which is no longer in existence, the short timeframe makes this unlikely. 
          Hyde told Lee the novel was finished in a letter from the Lodge dated 
          16 January 1937 and that she knew it would “crisp out” in the final typing. 
          This she undertook, probably on her new portable typewriter purchased 
          on 25 January, in the baches she stayed in at Whangaroa and elsewhere 
          over the next month or so. The completed typescript of the novel was to 
          be sent to her agent in London “next week,” she wrote to Stewart on 5 
          March 1937. It is not possible to determine when or in what form the Author’s 
          Foreword was added to the text, due to the incomplete state of the drafts. 
          The final typescript sent to A. P. Watt and Son, Hyde’s literary agent 
          in London, does not appear to be extant. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A 
          sliding picture of the days </b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is characteristic of her style that Hyde should have settled so fixedly 
          on the phrase, “the godwits fly” when she began the novel. As a newspaper 
          journalist as well as a poet, she had an ear for a telling phrase. Elsewhere 
          she described her ability to recall events in vivid detail by attaching 
          them to a single image. “I used a kind of phrase shorthand, very simple, 
          unintelligible unless I explained it myself”(<i>Dragon</i>, 281).  The 
          godwits evidently rang true as a piece of “phrase shorthand.” Hyde also 
          had Wednesday Gilfillan warn us that perception is shifty; things that 
          appear to be simple truths have “second selves, split personalities, double 
          faces”(<i>Wednesday</i>,<i> </i>273). These comments point to a symbolic—she 
          would have said poetic—way of layering meaning and perception, which Hyde 
          applied to her writing across genres. Initially she may not have fully 
          grasped what the godwits meant for her, but she was confident that she 
          could enable its significance to emerge. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          was determined to find a way to write “artlessly” or lyrically, to let 
          objects or incidents reveal their particular form and yet, by techniques 
          such as juxtaposition and repetition, to make each image radiate meaning 
          into larger rhythms and patterns. Her notebooks and letters to friends 
          show her constantly on the lookout for new and different approaches. She 
          admired Joseph Roth’s writing, for example, because of its qualities of 
          texture: “<u>His</u> stuff is so detailed that at first it looks solid—then 
          it breaks into <u>pattern</u>, like little leaves . . . I’ve tried for 
          that—the rounding out of things, picture, person, until their separate 
          existence is coherent in the pattern too”(To Schroder, September 1935). 
          She was also pleased when—too rarely—her own skill as a writer was appreciated. 
          Thanking Lee for his review of <i>Passport to Hell</i>, she wrote “You 
          were the first to do what I wanted, to pay some attention to the actual 
          structure of the book”(Lee, 7 August 1936).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
          one of Hyde’s major stylistic concerns was to realise images fully in 
          her work to convey the kind of “crystalline impressions” that Stevens 
          remarked. We can trace this concern a long way back in her writing career. 
          Over the summer of 1927–28 she had been commissioned by the New Zealand 
          Publicity Bureau to write 50 articles on places of interest to tourists. 
          For a short, exciting period she also wrote screen titles for silent films 
          made by the Bureau. She wrote to Schroder: “I go in and watch a wild jumble 
          of scenes which might mean anything.  I have to try to make them into 
          [a] titled sequence”(28 November 1927). That movie-making experience occurred 
          to her later as a vivid way of describing her style in the autobiography 
          she was attempting to write in 1934. It was, she explained to Schroder, 
          “a sort of sliding picture of the days . . . utterly sincere and true, 
          not just my halting truth but the truth of all the faces, tormented and 
          inarticulate and quelled by life, that slid past”(August 1934).<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span>[14]</span></a> 
          When she wrote <i>The Godwits Fly</i> Hyde used the technique with mastery. 
          To take only one example, Eliza’s emotional battle with Simone involving 
          jealousy over Timothy and the need for, and value of, marriage is conveyed 
          entirely by using this filmic technique of a “wild jumble of scenes” in 
          the “Business Girls” chapter. Hyde even foregrounds the method, heading 
          one of these quick scenes “A last shot”—the scene is Simone sitting in 
          the “Fleahouse” watching a “picture show”<i>(Godwits</i> 138).</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          most relevant formal context for <i>The Godwits Fly </i>is the bildungsroman, 
          or “novel of education,” though the novel has more commonly been read 
          as simply a lightly fictionalised autobiography. Whatever its origins 
          in the material of Hyde’s experience, the novel stands on its own terms 
          as a work of art. A good deal of the work she put into planning and shaping 
          the draft from mid-1936 to early in 1937 went into paring it down, she 
          told John A. Lee, to “21 years of a life”(2 April 1937). Big sections 
          of the early drafts of the novel were cut or rearranged, as described 
          above. The first person narration was transformed into predominantly an 
          omniscient third person point of view, which removed the constraint of 
          a single consciousness within the narrative. The result is a strongly 
          realised set of events and characters arrayed around Eliza so as to set 
          up symmetrical tensions and patterns of conflict and resolution which 
          reflect and define her progress. As bildungsroman, it shows Eliza to be 
          marked out for her special role, her world to be in a troubled state and 
          her education (“the growth of a poet’s mind”) equipping her to engage 
          fully with that turbulence. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          detailed naturalistic texture of the narrative contains the key thematic 
          patterns of the novel. An example is the way Eliza is marked out as the 
          key character. She is not the oldest child in her family, but from very 
          early in the story she makes herself the focus of attention. In the opening 
          pages she and her older sister Carly compete at story telling. Carly has 
          the natural advantage of age: her “memory stretched back” further; but 
          Eliza can “tell things better”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> </i>2). This first encounter 
          prefigures their later relationship as well as setting Eliza on her course 
          as an artist with words. Carly’s dislike of lentils, referred to three 
          times in this first chapter, echoes the archetypal story of sibling rivalry 
          from the Book of Genesis. The elder son Esau sold his birthright to his 
          younger brother Jacob for a pottage of lentils, fulfilling the prophesy 
          that “the elder shall serve the younger”(Genesis 25:34; 25:23). Symbolically 
          it will be Eliza, not Carly, who leads the way to the novel’s meaning.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
          worthiness to lead the spiritual quest for understanding is embedded in 
          the larger structure of the narrative as well as in its allusive detail. 
          In chapter twenty-two, titled “Carly,” the older sister vicariously experiences 
          the traumas Eliza has lived through. Her missed chance of marriage to 
          Trevor Sinjohn and the death of her friend Kirsty Blake parallel Eliza’s 
          lost relationship with Timothy. Witnessing a painful childbirth, she confronts 
          the experience Eliza had endured with the stillbirth of her baby. Carly 
          is moved to tears, but doesn’t have the “courage or the strength”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> 
          </i>224) to go beyond that. The following chapter, “Absalom, My Son,” 
          shows John Hannay’s vicarious pride in Eliza’s success as a poet. He pays 
          deference to her having reached a community with mankind which he had 
          only been able to prefigure in his impulse “to get into the masses who 
          have no consolation but life and death”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> </i>82). In 
          Eliza’s poems John recognises “a language which all could speak” and “a 
          child could understand . . . or an ageing man”(<i>Godwits</i><b>,<i> </i></b>229).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
          apprenticeship to her art involves her learning to be a poet, and also 
          learning what her subject matter is to be. From being able to “tell things 
          better,” she advances quickly—“Half-way through the war, Eliza became 
          a poet”—and at first comically, rhyming “Hun” with “gun” and “Verdun”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          70–71). In the “Little Ease” chapter she is engaging seriously with poetic 
          form and subject. By the end of the novel she has been published. Her 
          “humble little book,” “Stranger Face,” takes its place among the greats, 
          when it is raised with John’s aid to “the middle of the top shelf” at 
          the bookshop Poetry Counter alongside “a nice set of Browning in vermilion 
          leather covers”(<i>Godwits</i>, 226).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
          discovery of the subject matter she is to express unfolds from the experiences 
          and ideas she encounters. Her formal education begins under the tutelage 
          of Mr Bellew, who “talked about the godwits” and their mysterious (“secret”) 
          journey far away (“to Siberia . . . north . . .”). Even in her childish 
          imagination Eliza is able to sense something beyond Mr Bellew’s simple 
          account of geographic distance. She connects that mystery and remoteness 
          with the here-and-now of her own place, sensing “something delicate, wild 
          and far away” which has been obscured by jingoistic nationalism: “You 
          didn’t really have to think about it—Maoris, godwits, bird-of-my-native-land”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          33). Later, in “Little Ease,” Eliza goes further and rejects an education 
          system which is bent on division and dismemberment. She sums this up in 
          the image of a dissected buttercup: “we never do anything by wholes, it 
          is all dismembered like the buttercup, and nobody has the energy to stick 
          it together again”(<i>Godwits</i>, 95).<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span>[15]</span></a> 
          In her own family Eliza sees the same pattern of isolation, conflict and 
          division in the discord between Augusta and John. The fact that a world 
          war rages in the background of her childhood suggests that this is a universal 
          condition. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Alongside 
          Eliza’s formal education are more natural growth processes. Her sixteenth 
          birthday at Day’s Bay, described in “Reflections in the Water,” is a coming 
          of age. The motif of a journey and arrival is picked up in the picture 
          of the <i>Cobar</i> at the Day’s Bay wharf. In the dressing-shed Eliza 
          observes pink flesh, now with “patches of dark, frizzy hair”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          117) and has an insight into how Carly’s sexuality is a vulnerability 
          that will be exploited (<i>Godwits</i>, 115). She is then led by her mother 
          along the “up-path,” beyond a waterfall like a “white bridal veil,” past 
          “two lovers lying in the fern” (“‘And only man is vile,’says Augusta”), 
          then on to the “lazy serenity” of a street full of “old houses.” This 
          is her initiation into the world of “man, woman and child”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          118–119). As they all journey back to the everyday world on the <i>Cobar</i> 
          Eliza recognises in the snatches of community song the subjects with which 
          she must engage.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          characters in the novel ring true to life, but in this aspect of the novel 
          too, what appears to be simple documentary realism resolves unobtrusively 
          into form and structure. The interaction and juxtaposition of characters 
          creates a pattern of figures and “journeys” surrounding Eliza that reflects 
          in various ways on her central “journey.” The major figures in the pattern 
          are two women, Augusta and Simone, and two men, John and Timothy. Together 
          the women reflect Eliza’s exploration of the personal and introspective, 
          while the men reflect her exploration of the social, political and sensory 
          realms.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          Augusta’s life Eliza sees the domestic realm upheld. Augusta’s values 
          of motherhood, security and conformity find their doomed extreme in Carly. 
          Her unfulfilled journey to an idealised England was strongly realised 
          in the First Version of the novel but here it is pushed further into the 
          background. Eliza’s father, John, who was a shadowy presence in the First 
          Version and had been killed off by the end of chapter two, now plays a 
          strong role as a foil to Augusta’s values. The depiction of their fractious 
          marriage is highlighted as essential to the novel’s thematic structure. 
          Augusta’s pride and desire for respectability hold her aloof from her 
          partner and those around her. These negative qualities are the legacy 
          which Eliza has to be able to renounce in order to see value in “the spawning 
          ground of life”(<i>Godwits</i>, 234). On the other hand, Augusta’s “genuine 
          toughness of spiritual fibre”(<i>Godwits</i>, 82) is her positive legacy 
          to Eliza.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          Simone Eliza sees the emerging artist imperfectly reflected. Simone’s 
          experimentation with personal style attracts Eliza but is ultimately empty 
          of real engagement. Simone lacks Eliza’s bravery and willingness to take 
          risks—in relationships as well as in other spheres: “What is the good 
          of love without marriage?” she asks, to which Eliza responds, “What is 
          the good of marriage without love?”(<i>Godwits</i>, 139). If Simone’s 
          negative quality is her timidity, then the positive lesson she has for 
          Eliza is her strong and intact sense of herself and her own needs as a 
          basis for action. Eliza is disappointed that Simone chooses to marry Toby 
          at the end of the novel, until she is able to recognise that Simone and 
          Toby may need the complementary qualities they sense in each other: “she 
          was looking for her lost daemon . . . Queerest of all if Toby turned out 
          to be the daemon. Inside marriage she’ll have a new face, a stranger face”—the 
          last phrase echoing the title of Eliza’s book (<i>Godwits</i>, 234). In 
          their marriage, at which Eliza is bridesmaid in the last chapter, there 
          is the hope of true union and equality in contrast to the isolating tensions 
          between John and Augusta. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">John 
          Hannay’s faith is rooted in the socialist brotherhood of man. So in her 
          father Eliza sees the world through a political frame. His failure to 
          connect this faith with his daily life makes him by turns angry and sentimental. 
          His fantasy of martyrdom for Tom McGrath, his union boss (<i>Godwits</i>, 
          154), is pure sentimentality and his anger is comically parodied in the 
          oafish Olaf. The positive side of John’s legacy to Eliza is his “desire 
          to rejoin the whole”(<i>Godwits</i>, 82), his conviction that the positive 
          driving force of human nature is generated at its most instinctual level. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Timothy 
          drags Eliza at a gasping run into the physical and sensual world. Physical 
          exertion and sexual energy are shot through the various worlds he encounters 
          with Birkett, Damaris Gayte, Shelagh and others.<a
  href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span>[16]</span></a> His idealism prevents 
          him, however, from being able to participate unselfconsciously in the 
          everyday world: “he was disappointed when the tramp called him ‘Sir,’ 
          instead of ‘Digger’ or ‘Mate’” (<i>Godwits</i>, 123). As if her own energy 
          has been earthed by his, Eliza risks being trapped in a state of suspended 
          animation under the influence of his keeping her “white, for an ideal”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          123). But his zest for life in all its forms and his willingness to commit 
          without hesitation to the great cause of humanity is a positive influence 
          on her. Eliza reflects this influence in her own discovery that “It doesn’t 
          matter much” what course of life she follows because she is capable of 
          being a “stock now of various goods . . . for everybody”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          235).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          central journey that Eliza makes in the novel is through the experience 
          of alienation (“loneliness”) and loss—first Timothy, then her stillborn 
          baby—to disintegration and beyond these to an integrating self-knowledge. 
          The redemptive possibility she struggles towards is foreshadowed in Timothy’s 
          mythologised journey to the seat of Empire as a “Barbarian for Caesar.” 
          Here he is imagined not as a colonial subject who goes to pay tribute, 
          but as a free citizen of the world in full command of himself: “I have 
          been afraid and made others afraid”(<i>Godwits</i>, 182). He finds his 
          true identity paradoxically by placing himself in the service of a cause 
          greater than just his own. Eliza herself pays a tribute to the Kingdom 
          of the Defeated. Her stillborn baby is the “delicate thing” chosen by 
          the “gods of beauty” to be taken from this world into their realm.(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          209) It is after her baby is born dead that she rediscovers her “old power” 
          to write—now with “a stronger face, an estranged face”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          210). Like Eurydice in Rilke’s poem, “Orpheus, Eurydice, Hermes,” with 
          which the novel concludes (<i>Godwits</i>, 235), Eliza is taken apart 
          from the mundane world and metamorphosed paradoxically into her “undiscovered 
          self.” Rooted now in “the wonderful deep mine of souls,” she can be “given 
          far and wide” as if from an inexhaustible source. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
          “21 years of a life,”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span>[17]</span></a> 
          the bildungsroman leaves Eliza rooted in a deep understanding of the human 
          condition and poised to face a future that is unknown but no longer feared. 
          And she need no longer suffer loneliness, since she shares her fate with 
          all other human beings whose “odd disjointed thoughts about their homes 
          and life’s work were the hermitages in which they dwelt”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
          236). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Part 
          of the reason Hyde was content to concentrate the scope of <i>Godwits</i> 
          was that she intended to connect it to a larger thematic architecture 
          in her subsequent work.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"
  title=""><span>[18]</span></a> There is a direct line of succession from Eliza’s 
          self-containment at the end of <i>The Godwits Fly</i> to the “centre of 
          equipoise” Hyde describes in <i>A Home in This World</i>, and elsewhere 
          in her later work (in the poem “The Balance,” written in 1936, for instance). 
          This is a creative and restorative state of mind freed from partisan feeling 
          and divisiveness, and in touch with the most fundamental level of human 
          nature. Individuals in this state are capable of functioning at a high 
          level socially, acting as what another of Hyde’s characters, Macnamara, 
          calls a “stabilising agent” (<i>Nor the Years Condemn</i>,<i> </i>309). 
          In <i>The Book of Nadath </i>(1999), written very shortly after <i>The 
          Godwits Fly</i> was finished, the section called “The Far Flyers” adds 
          resonance to the godwits’ migratory cycle—now two-way—between geographies 
          of the human spirit.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          godwit motif exemplifies how Hyde constantly recontextualised key images 
          and patterns to show evolving thematic preoccupations at work. This “phrase 
          shorthand,” so much a signature of her writing style, draws attention 
          to sites where a particular “effort towards understanding”(<i>Dragon</i>, 
          13) is being made—always for Hyde a joint enterprise between the writer 
          and the reader. The effort is directed at opening up the text rather than 
          pinning it down to a final “meaning,” since, as she wrote in the Foreword 
          to this novel, “Passing judgements . . . is no use at all.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
          when Hyde inscribed <i>The Godwits Fly</i> to Gilbert Tothill, “This imperfect 
          part of truth,” she was inscribing her respect for the things that can 
          be known and not known about a life. She was also inscribing her fascination 
          with ways—as a writer and as a reader—of reaching out imaginatively to 
          “our undiscovered selves,” so that the absence of certainty or closure 
          in dealing with our own lives and the lives of others is not alienating 
          but boundlessly integrating and creative. She was also placing herself 
          in the company of other poets and writers whom she felt had the privilege 
          and the duty to be “the organ of the voice, given back to the body, which 
          is the people,” to express the fundamentals of existence in the world 
          of “man, woman and child.” In the words of a fellow poet, Edna St Vincent 
          Millay, to whom she alluded in the Author’s Foreword:</font></p>

            Fly,</i> there appeared Wevers’s edition of <i>Robin Hyde: Selected 
            Poems</i>; <i>Dragon Rampant</i> was reprinted with an introduction 
            by Derek Challis and Linda Hardy; and Tony Isaac’s video telefeature 
            <i>Iris</i> was screened. Derek Challis also published for the first 
            time <i>A Home in This World</i> in that fabulous year for Hyde readers. 
            In 1986 <i>Passport to Hell</i> was reprinted with an introduction by 
            Don Smith and <i>Nor the Years Condemn</i> reappeared with an introduction 
            by Phillida Bunkle, Linda Hardy and Jacqueline Matthews. Shortly afterwards, 
            <i>Wednesday’s Children</i> was reprinted with an introduction by Susan 
            Ash. The Golden Press <i>Check to Your King</i> also made a reappearance 
            in 1989. <i>Disputed Ground</i> (1990), edited and introduced by Gillian 
            Boddy and Jacqueline Matthews, collected much of Hyde’s journalism, 
            but is significant not least for its two substantial essays on Hyde’s 
            life and her writing career. </font></p>

  title="">[6]</a> Opening up the text has been interpreted as an editorial strategy 
            in Michele Leggott’s editions of <i>The Victory Hymn 1935–1995</i> (1995) 
            and <i>The Book of Nadath</i> (1999). Both exert a gravitational pull 
            back towards the poetry on which Hyde staked her reputation. With sensitivity 
            to Hyde’s synthesising imagination, they employ multi-layered and open 
            ways of presenting and reading textual variants. Leggott’s innovation 
            is strikingly appropriate and relevant to Hyde’s work—so much of which, 
            like Wednesday Gilfillan’s “truth,” has “second selves, split personalities, 
            double faces”(<i>Wednesday</i>, 273), all of which need to be seen and 
            to interplay dynamically, not to be resolved. “It’s also development 
            of a textual strategy to fit the writing practice as encountered in 
            an extensive archive. We are abolishing (as she did) the (Modernist) 
            notion of a single, authoritative text. Whatever rolls through the typewriter 
            next is the text”(Leggott, email to Sandbrook, 6 February 2001).</font></p>

            by Challis. The material continued to be used, arranged and annotated 
            by Gloria Rawlinson up to about 1970, when her edition of the text was 
            published as part of the Auckland University Press/Oxford University 
            Press “New Zealand Fiction” reprint series. There is a detailed description 
            of the material in Patrick Sandbrook, “A descriptive inventory of some

  style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span>There is some evidence in an interpretation of 
            Hyde’s 1935 Journal that there was a further “coda” to this ending of 
            the text; but the text of a “Part Three” to the First Version is not 
            with the rest of the draft and has not been identified elsewhere. The 
            Journal says: “I’ll have to rewrite some of <i>The Godwits Fly</i>, 
            I’m not sure how or why it dissatisfies me, but it just does, except 
            the first book [= Part?] and the very small one which is at the end—the 
            ending is really good, I think, and the whole book mustn’t be wasted”(June 
            2, 78).  There is nothing in the extant text of First Version that clearly 
            fits the description of a “very small [Part] at the end.” This passage 
            from the Journal also supports the view that Hyde’s particular difficulty 
            lay in recasting what would become the latter part of the novel in its 
            published form.</font></p>

  name="_edn9" title="">[9]</a> One of Mitcalfe’s marginal notes on Hyde’s draft 
            reads: “in this book I would like <i>more</i> Eliza and more real Eliza. 
            In satisfying your secret desires by making her more heroic you make 
            the story less real &amp; herself less a person + less appealing. ‘Tout 
            comprendre c’est tout pardonner’ + her faults revealed in truthful narrative 
            draw only sympathy”(AU-B12b, Folder 4 (fragment 2) 154). There was an 
            extensive correspondence between Hyde and Mitcalfe over many years, 
            but little of this remains. The Challis collection has seven letters 
            and some excerpts in transcription included in notes made by Gwen Mitcalfe 
            for Challis (not sighted in preparing this account).</font></p>

            from Rawlinson’s account of events leading to the next known full draft 
            of the novel. Rawlinson highlights a handwritten notebook draft of the 
            chapter, “Reflections in the Water,” dated by Hyde “June 22nd 1936,” 
            as the moment when Hyde made a “breakthrough” which enabled her to reframe 
            the novel (Rawlinson, xiii)—a milestone event as significant in Rawlinson’s 
            reading as Hyde’s “sudden” decision taken on 2 March 1935 to begin the 
            First Version. The view expressed here is that Hyde began the redrafting 
            earlier—about April 1936—and that it was the subject matter and structure 
            of the latter half of the novel that was being re-worked: there was 
            no single “breakthrough” to the new version.</font></p>
