        This imperfect part of truth<br>

        April 1939, England</i> </font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        is the inscription on the flyleaf of the brand new copy of <i>The Godwits 
        Fly</i> that Robin Hyde sent to Gilbert Tothill, the psychiatrist whom 
        she had also regarded as her mentor and friend. When she wrote the words 
        she was half a world away, broke but writing hard; battered and ill as 
        a consequence of months spent at the battle-front in China resisting Japanese 
        invasion. She was still pitching all she had into the cause of humanity 
        and justice as Europe too slid towards war; and about to cross swords 
        with some hard-nosed English play producers over terms for a script she 
        was just then completing. Four months later, at 33 years of age, she would 
        be dead—of “benzedrine poisoning and suicide while of an unsound mind”(<i>A 
        Home</i>, xx. But at that moment in the northern spring of 1939, she held 
        success in her hand).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gilbert 
        Tothill’s copy of <i>The Godwits Fly, </i>held in the Auckland City Library’s 
        archives, was donated by him in 1965. Its inscription, “This imperfect 
        part of truth,” still gestures towards the things about a life that have 
        to go unsaid—or that can only be understood imperfectly by those who haven’t 
        lived through them. They are like the knowledge that war veterans cannot 
        put into words. Hyde had glimpsed that painful knowledge in Starkie and 
        his generation and written it into <i>Passport to Hell; </i>she had lived 
        her own hell in the war zone of China in 1938 and recorded it in <i>Dragon 
        Rampant. </i>The same kind of knowledge dwells in the contours of the 
        “steep blue country of melancholy” as they appear in this novel. Eliza 
        Hannay’s experience of loss and alienation is a terrain familiar to Hyde 
        herself and to Tothill, who had been with her on part of her own journey 
        through it. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Robin 
        Hyde had recovered her mental health and self-esteem under the care of 
        Dr Tothill and his colleague Dr Buchanan after a breakdown in 1933. On 
        1 June she had jumped off an Auckland wharf in a desperate rejection of 
        a mentality and a set of circumstances that had made her life not worth 
        living. Fished out, she was put in Auckland Hospital’s DT (delirium tremens) 
        cells, had a rebellious and unhappy period at Avondale Mental Hospital 
        and then left Auckland briefly under her mother’s care. From Wellington 
        she went to Northland then back to Auckland where she appeared in court 
        in early December to face a charge for the suicide attempt. The next day 
        she collapsed again in the middle of a busy street and begged to be taken 
        back to Avondale Hospital where she was admitted as a voluntary patient 
        to the Lodge.  There her condition improved; she gradually rediscovered 
        the power to write and began to forge new terms on which to live. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        impulse to write directly about her own experience led Hyde first to produce 
        an autobiography, which she completed in 1934 for Tothill. About a year 
        later she returned to the subject of the intimate course of her own life 
        and wrote <i>The Godwits Fly</i>. Getting the story down as she wanted 
        it to be was a long, hard struggle, involving rewriting the draft, thinking 
        and reading about style and authorial control, and seeking advice from 
        friends. By the time it was finished two years later, she felt she had 
        succeeded in representing human experience meaningfully and honestly using 
        the pattern and texture—“imperfect parts” though they were—of her own 
        individual life. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        main elements of Hyde’s life have been described in a number of other 
        places, but for readers encountering her work for the first time, the 
        main outline is as follows. Iris Wilkinson (Hyde’s real name) was born 
        on 19 January 1906 in Capetown. Her parents moved to New Zealand shortly 
        after she was born, the second of four daughters, and she was raised in 
        Wellington. While at Wellington Girls’ College she gained local notice 
        as a poet.  From about the age of fifteen she also knew a young man named 
        Harry Sweetman.  She fell deeply in love with him and dreamed of a shared 
        life of travel and adventure. Her strong attachment to Harry endured, 
        even though it was mixed with bitter disappointment when he set off alone 
        for England, where he died shortly afterwards.  She became a career journalist, 
        working during the 1920s and 1930s on the <i>Dominion</i> in Wellington, 
        the Christchurch <i>Sun</i>, <i>NZ Truth</i>, the <i>Wanganui Chronicle</i> 
        and the <i>New Zealand Observer</i> in Auckland. She also had freelance 
        articles, stories and poems published widely in newspapers and magazines 
        throughout New Zealand, in Australia and Britain. She earned respect as 
        a hard-working and independent-minded journalist. She was inquisitive 
        about what made her culture tick—sharply observant about the position 
        of women, prepared to get actively involved in radical politics and economic 
        debate at a time when New Zealand—and the rest of the world—was gripped 
        by Depression, aware of taha Maori and informed about international politics.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span>[3]</span></a> 
        By the mid-1930s Hyde was also an accomplished poet of the new generation 
        and a novelist of great promise. </font></p>
       
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At 
        a personal level, her life was difficult and tragic. An injury to her 
        knee in 1924 left her lame and in the long course of medical treatment 
        she began a dependence on drugs that persisted to the end of her life. 
        There were two unwed pregnancies; the first baby (Robin) died at birth 
        in Sydney when she was 20, the second (Derek) born four years later had 
        to be provided for discreetly. The experience of motherhood with its complex 
        economic and emotional pressures also took a toll of grief and anguish. 
        Unmarried motherhood stigmatised her socially, strained family and other 
        relationships and threatened to undermine her chances of a steady career 
        in the respectable world of work.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
        was driven to reckless forms of behaviour. Two breakdowns were followed 
        by periods of convalescence, first in Hanmer in 1927, then from 1933 to 
        early 1937 as a voluntary patient at the Lodge (she invariably referred 
        to it as ‘The Grey Lodge’) a residential clinic attached to Auckland Mental 
        Hospital in Avondale. In the relative security and serenity of these surroundings 
        her creativity flourished. From her time at Hanmer had come poetry; from 
        her attic room in the Lodge came a torrent of poetry, autobiography, novels, 
        stories and plays. <i>The Godwits Fly</i> is part of this extraordinary 
        burst of activity in 1934–35 that gave rise to almost half of her total 
        output of creative writing. As she regained health, she was able to come 
        and go more freely from the Lodge and get involved in the social and literary 
        life of Auckland. She became a well-known figure in the town and kept 
        in close touch with the current scene. </font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
        1936 the Depression was over and the national economy was rebuilding. 
        A Labour government had swept to power in November 1935 with a fresh vision 
        for New Zealand’s economy, society and place in the world. The local literary 
        establishment was feeling confident too, and was already forging monuments 
        to itself. There was a New Zealand Authors’ Week held in April and plans 
        were already being laid for New Zealand’s Centennial to be celebrated 
        in 1940. Younger writers did not have much of the limelight—Hyde was invited 
        to speak at Authors’ Week only at the last minute—but they were stimulated 
        by the issues nevertheless. There was a good deal of talk in the air about 
        the Great New Zealand Novel and other prodigies. Hyde celebrated that 
        energy and innovation in an article for <i>Art in New Zealand</i>, seeing 
        great potential in the emerging talents of her own generation. Poet and 
        personality Rex Fairburn, for example, whom she knew and admired from 
        their period of common interest in Douglas Social Credit in the early 
        1930s, might be able to combine his radical politics with the energy and 
        power of his exceptional lyric gift to produce “the New Zealand novel 
        about which New Zealanders still moan.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span>[4]</span></a> 
        The prediction was also a challenge to produce the goods—and it was directed 
        at herself as much as at Fairburn and their contemporaries. </font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        was optimistic about her own chances of achieving recognition as a clear 
        and strong voice for her generation, as she set to work to revise and 
        complete<i> The</i> <i>Godwits Fly</i> in the winter of 1936. She felt 
        she was writing with maturity and discipline. <i>Journalese </i>(1934) 
        had already been published locally by the National Printing Co. in Auckland, 
        but her big break had come when Macmillan’s of London accepted <i>The 
        Conquerors </i>(1935)<i>,</i> her second book of poems, as part of their 
        prestigious Modern Poets series. Shortly after, <i>Passport to Hell</i> 
        (1936) was taken by the English publisher, Hurst and Blackett. Now she 
        was an international writer with a literary agent in London; and publishers 
        wanted more of her work. <i>Wednesday’s Children</i> would soon appear 
        under Hurst and Blackett’s imprint and they also had a collection of her 
        short stories called “Unicorn Pasture” for consideration (though it was 
        not subsequently published). America was in her sights too. <i>Check to 
        Your King</i>, the product of her ground-breaking research in Sir George 
        Grey’s sprawling archives, had been submitted for a competition run by 
        the <i>Atlantic Monthly </i>and was commended by the judges. </font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Could 
        <i>The Godwits Fly</i> now put her firmly on the literary world map? Was 
        the “schoolgirl poetess” of six years earlier, with two slim volumes of 
        verse from a small corner of the world about to hit the trans-Atlantic 
        big-time? </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She 
        readied herself for greater independence. As a kind of trial flight, she 
        made several short stays away from the Lodge on the North Shore and elsewhere, 
        then a much longer trip in September to Dunedin and on to other parts 
        of the country. But it was a complex set of events and motivations that 
        finally prompted her to leave the Lodge altogether in early 1937. Now 
        there was a difficult year of living precariously from her writing on 
        the North Shore in Auckland before she left New Zealand on 18 January, 
        the day before her thirty-second birthday. In Hong Kong she abandoned 
        her intended trans-Siberian trip to Europe and went instead into war-torn 
        China. Months later she travelled on to England but by a different route. 
        New work was being published in England and she carried works in progress 
        with her. Still writing prolifically, but now seriously ill and relying 
        on friends for cheap lodgings much of the time, she survived in and around 
        London for about a year. Then on 23 August 1939, as Europe too stood at 
        the brink before plunging to its destruction in world war, Iris Wilkinson 
        took her own life.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
        decade before, Hyde had written to Harry Sweetman’s brother, Hardy, advising 
        him to “Paint your own dreams—of a life short as you like but vivid”(29 
        May 1928). The advice was her manifesto and perhaps her requiem: a determination—almost 
        a desperation—to make every moment count.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><font size="3">An 
        individual living in the world</font></b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How 
        are we to read Hyde’s life in relation to her fiction? Since her death, 
        almost every one of the publications of her work has had biographical 
        information attached to it by its editor. As a result Hyde has always 
        been “present” alongside the work itself, like another character, needing 
        to be read into our understanding of the fiction in some way. Boddy and 
        Matthews’s approach in <i>Disputed Ground </i>is an interesting example. 
        Where they had no other available information, they incorporated events 
        and descriptions directly from <i>The Godwits Fly</i> into their biographical 
        essay on Hyde to produce the most directly biographical reading of the 
        novel to date. Other readers have had a variety of reactions. Some have 
        been passionate admirers. Some have wanted to read about her life with 
        less indirectness; others have reacted to her “hysteria” and “lack of 
        control”; still others have not been able to find their expectations about 
        fiction readily fulfilled because of their sense of the writer’s active 
        presence.  The prevailing critical taste after her death was also unfavourable 
        to her writing. A new definition of New Zealand’s “high culture” was being 
        forged in the post-war years of the late 1940s and 1950s. A modernist 
        style and national themes were the vogue, cast in small, highly crafted 
        forms—lyric poems and short stories—preferably with the artist, as in 
        James Joyce’s words, “invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, 
        paring his fingernails.” Looking back across the war years as a divide 
        of time and sensibility, Curnow, Bertram, Brasch and other priests of 
        the high culture had little sympathy or space for other ways of framing 
        experience. Hyde was problematic: she wrote “too much” and in unsettled 
        forms; her sense of “New Zealandness” was too prone to fuse and interlock 
        with the supra-national, the mythical and the archaic; her “life” bled 
        through into her “art.” She was considered as a specimen of an unsuccessful 
        branch on the tree of New Zealand’s cultural evolution, and was bypassed.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span>[5]</span></a></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        a considerable period, her work remained largely unknown and unread. <i>The 
        Godwits Fly</i>, in print continuously since 1970, has in fact been the 
        most available point of access for readers, apart from the selective glimpses 
        offered by the poems included in various anthologies. Then in the 1980s, 
        there was a remarkable recovery of her other writing. Bridget Armstrong’s 
        solo drama <i>The Flight of the Godwit</i> (1982) was the prelude to a 
        burst of renewed interest in her spectacular and tragic life story.<a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span>[6]</span></a> In a span of less 
        than ten years following Armstrong’s solo dramatisation, Hyde’s work achieved 
        a publishing prominence matched by no other literary figure of her generation. 
        All of her known prose work was brought forward from the 1930s to a new 
        audience and a new critical climate; together with enough fresh information 
        about her life, the depth and range of her writing and her creative process 
        to re-make her place in the national literature.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
        unique feature of Hyde’s work is that a significant amount of previously 
        unknown work has appeared long after her death, alongside the re-published 
        texts, and much more is yet to be published. There is still a remarkable 
        freshness to the work as well. Her nonconformity in matters of genre and 
        style—considered odd or perverse in her own time—now reads as a rich and 
        insightful engagement with ways of inscribing experience and opening up 
        the text.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span>[7]</span></a> 
        The collection of articles, reviews and social commentary in <i>Disputed 
        Ground</i> re-contextualised her non-fiction writing. Completely “new” 
        works by Hyde have included <i>A Home in This World </i>and<i> The Book 
        of Nadath</i>, both of which show new facets of her work and also invite 
        a re-reading of the previously known canon. Other unpublished work comprises 
        more poems, autobiography, almost a hundred short stories, half a dozen 
        plays, the verse chronicle “De Thierry’s Progress,” a novel called “The 
        Unbelievers” and the incomplete start of at least one other called “Come 
        Away, O Human Child.” Yet other of Hyde’s teeming offspring are missing, 
        presumed lost: novels called “The Windy House”(1929), and “These Poor 
        Old Hands”(1935); and the playscript based on <i>Wednesday’s Children</i>.(1939) 
        A considerable body of letters, journals and other evidence of Hyde’s 
        life and craft also remains to be fully explored. Academic research interest 
        is growing both within New Zealand and beyond. A biography and a Collected 
        Poems are currently in preparation. Filmmakers and screenwriters continue 
        to be drawn to the dramatic possibilities of her writing. We haven’t heard 
        the last of Hyde yet.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Each 
        of the new editions and new texts has been accompanied by further insights 
        into the writing, its context and its authorship. The availability of 
        more information about both Hyde’s personal life and her writing career 
        has stimulated exploration of the political, social and literary tensions 
        at work in them. Feminist and post-modernist ways of reading the literature 
        and the life have contested the older modernist approach—though at their 
        most reactive such readings have risked simply privileging Hyde for the 
        same marginality that had caused her to be disregarded in the cultural 
        construct of the “Curnow generation.” Pondering that literary-historical 
        about-face, Mary Paul offers a useful corrective in her reminder that 
        the work needs careful reading, not special pleading. “To understand Hyde’s 
        narratives only for their pathos is to reduce their significance . . . 
        Hyde wanted a new way of showing an individual living in the world, and 
        at the same time of questioning the boundaries of self and world. [She 
        was] interested, not so much in subjectivity for its own sake, but in 
        sites where social ideologies and forces were busy playing out their effects”(<i>Her 
        Side of the Story</i>, 174, 157).  <i>The Godwits Fly</i> is one such 
        site.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><font size="3">Concerning 
        godwits</font></b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is remarkable how poorly Hyde’s use of the godwit motif has been received 
        by critics, despite the strong readership the novel has continued to have. 
        The title of the novel had evidently been the first thing Hyde decided 
        on. Rawlinson, looking through Hyde’s papers, noted the “sudden” decision 
        recorded in her journal 2 March 1935: “Settled: I’m going to write a faintly 
        autobiographical novel called ‘The Godwits Fly’”(Rawlinson, intro. to 
        <i>Godwits,</i> xiii–xiv). Joan Stevens is representative of critical 
        opinion in passing lightly over the godwit theme. Instead she preferred 
        the Mansfieldian depiction of “crystalline impressions of childhood days” 
        in the first half of the novel, adding: “Unfortunately, the adult portion 
        of the book is less effective, distorted possibly by its intimate relation 
        to her own life”(Stevens, intro. to <i>Check</i>,<i> ix</i>). Rawlinson 
        took the same view (Rawlinson, xi, xvi–xvii).  More recently Stuart Murray 
        is also equivocal: Hyde is “clearly a successor to Mansfield’s analysis 
        of an emerging settler society,” he says, supporting this with some of 
        the major correspondences between<i> The Godwits Fly</i> and Mansfield’s 
        New Zealand stories in <i>never a soul at home </i>(1998) (189). He finds 
        Hyde unable to sustain fully realised characters in the larger form of 
        the novel, however. Timothy Cardew he sees as a “stock character”: “the 
        decade’s composite poet/tramp/scholar.” In his view, that Timothy should 
        “command such an investment on Eliza’s part unbalances the novel, and 
        Hyde struggles in particular to find an adequate ending to this narrative”(Murray,<i> 
        </i>192). These readers’ presumption that the novel is to be read primarily 
        as a picture of childhood in suburban Wellington leaves a great deal unexplained. 
        The key to avoiding reductiveness is the godwit motif itself, which needs 
        a more complex reading. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        herself draws attention to things that are <i>wrong</i> with the godwit 
        motif, in the Author’s Foreword. First: “many people do not know what 
        a godwit is.” Then “godwits, flying north, never go near England.  They 
        fly to Siberia.” Finally, having flown away, “logically . . . they ought 
        to have the same compulsion to come back.”   The Foreword offers no easy 
        resolution of these difficulties. But by deliberately confronting us with 
        the fact that the literal migration of the godwits is not a good fit with 
        the events of the novel, Hyde is suggesting that we read with our wits 
        about us. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Taken 
        most directly, the godwit’s flight is intended to be read as a metaphor 
        for an emerging post-colonial state of mind. It depicts the “white” New 
        Zealanders’ (as she called them elsewhere) “Colonial England-hunger,” 
        or over-easy reliance for cultural sustenance on their stock of canned 
        and preserved culture, imported from Europe—and past its “use by” date—which 
        had retarded their effort to cultivate more wholesome homegrown forms. 
        The lack of a sense of community in contemporary New Zealand society had 
        already emerged as a theme in <i>Journalese</i>, written just a year or 
        so before she began <i>The Godwits Fly:</i> “If society consists of a 
        body of individuals with some real tie of feeling between them, we have 
        no society in New Zealand as yet: there are ties of prejudice and self-interest, 
        but of genuine feeling, no” (<i>Journalese</i>, 113).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
        But that tricky Foreword also clues us in to look at Eliza’s emerging 
        powers of thought and action rather than simply the idea of a geographical 
        journey to England or even an exploration of social themes. In the novel 
        Eliza realises that it is “ourselves we reach out for, our own undiscovered 
        selves”<i>(Godwits</i>, 137). To be a godwit in these terms is to go in 
        search of oneself; a search which is without end, since the self is in 
        part defined by the journey it makes—as the godwit is defined by its endless, 
        instinctive migrations around the world. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
        Godwits Fly</i> was the novel that Hyde re-worked most extensively of 
        all her prose writing. Evidence of her creative process remains in the 
        collections of her manuscripts and archives; and these traces provide 
        insight into how she worked and how <i>The Godwits Fly </i>came to be 
        in its present form<i>.</i><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span>[8]</span></a> 
        The Hyde archives are physically disparate, and much remains to be done 
        to establish bibliographical coherence among the various collections. 
        Other lost pieces of the puzzle may yet come to light. Looking at the 
        <i>Godwits</i> material, we can partially resolve the interrelationships 
        of the surviving fragmentary drafts but questions inevitably remain because 
        of that fragmentation. Bearing these limitations in mind, the following 
        is a brief outline of the novel’s construction. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        had written the autobiography for Tothill in 1934, about a year before 
        she began on <i>The Godwits Fly</i>. The broad outline of the “faintly 
        autobiographical” <i>Godwits </i>was clear in her mind from having written 
        the earlier text. The First Version (as Rawlinson named it) was written 
        quickly and evidently with very little in the way of planning or other 
        preamble before the 2 March journal entry: “Settled: I’m going to write 
        a faintly autobiographical novel called ‘The Godwits Fly’. . . . telling 
        about the Colonial England hunger, and they that depart, and they that 
        stay at home – Girl to be called Eliza Hannay, God knows why – But there 
        she is – Like me but very much pleasanter and I think a sense of humour 
        would be a help.” A week or so later Hyde was at chapter four, but then 
        she paused for about six weeks to write <i>Passport to Hell.</i>  By 12 
        May the <i>Godwits</i> draft was finished. In the space of about four 
        weeks’ writing time, in the attic at Avondale, she had completed 300 pages. 
        But she was unhappy with the result and put it aside for further reflection 
        (Rawlinson, xi–xii). This typescript is still substantially complete, 
        though it lacks a title page and possibly an Introduction. It is currently 
        located partly in Challis’s collection (261 pages) and partly in the Auckland 
        University Library collection (38 pages). The story is structured in two 
        parts.  While the title page of the first Part is missing, a separate 
        title page for Part Two is headed “Success” but then crossed out by Hyde 
        and in her hand renamed “The Middle Distance.” As well as this structural 
        division, the First Version has significant differences in arrangement 
        and treatment from the later drafts.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        wrote prolifically after she had put <i>Godwits </i>aside.  Between 12 
        May 1935, when the First Version was finished, and the autumn of 1936 
        she produced an abundance of poems, short stories and articles as well 
        as re-writing <i>Check to Your King</i> and working on three other novels: 
        “These Poor Old Hands,” “The Unbelievers” (both still unpublished) and 
        <i>Wednesday’s Children</i>. Images, incidents, themes and stylistic approaches 
        from the First Version recur in various ways in these other works. Letters 
        from this time and passages in her journal and notebooks show her actively 
        experimenting with ways to overcome the problems that had left her dissatisfied 
        with <i>Godwits. </i>Then, in a letter dated 8 May 1936, Hyde told John 
        A. Lee she had begun redrafting <i>The Godwits Fly.</i> </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
        had spurred her to action? Finishing other work, particularly <i>Wednesday’s 
        Children, </i>left her desk clear. External events such as the April 1936 
        Authors’ Week also energised her with the feeling that the moment was 
        right to gain from a broadening public interest in local writers and themes. 
        Lee’s own <i>Children of the Poor</i> impressed her as a model of fictionalised 
        autobiography. But probably more personal pressures dictated that she 
        would now turn her attention to the autobiographical novel, in preference 
        to the many projects she either had started or had in mind. There is for 
        instance a long description in her journal on 13 March 1936 of the emotions 
        recalled by a letter received years before from Harry Sweetman, when she 
        visited the family home in Wellington at Christmas. The letter made ghosts 
        walk: “Twelve pages of it and tonight lying next to my heart! If that 
        seems childish, so was he—he had a curl of my hair, and says in the letter 
        that to sleep without it gave him nightmarish dreams.” It is strong emotions 
        like these that may have been the driving energy that took the novel in 
        a new direction. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        returned to work on the novel in April 1936. Dialogue at this time with 
        her closest friend, Gwen Mitcalfe (née Hawthorn), seems to have helped 
        her to rethink the novel’s approach and in particular to focus on the 
        relationships between Eliza, Simone and Timothy. It was this focus, and 
        the playing out of the events of Eliza’s “21st year,” which was the “breakthrough” 
        to resolving her dissatisfaction with the form and structure of the First 
        Version.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Major 
        changes to the First Version were the result. She removed an extensive 
        treatment of Augusta’s godwit journey before Eliza is born. She rounded 
        out John Hannay’s character—he had been killed off at the beginning of 
        the First Version. Other friends of Eliza’s, who competed with Simone’s 
        characterisation in importance, also disappeared. Most importantly, the 
        final third of the novel was reshaped to remove both interpretative comments 
        on the society and politics of the day, and an account of Eliza as a successful 
        journalist travelling and working around New Zealand, living in Christchurch, 
        visiting the Marlborough Sounds and the Wanganui river valley and other 
        events. Other characters—a travelling companion called Hildred, Marlborough 
        residents, a spiritualist called Shadow—were also removed from the novel. 
        Hyde also abandoned the (literally) “cliff-hanger” ending of the First 
        Version, which has Eliza drive off the road to avoid hitting a mob of 
        sheep as she contemplates a destination either at a lonely farm called 
        “Solitude” or at Spirits Bay in Northland.<a href="#_edn9"
name="_ednref9" title=""><span>[9]</span></a> Part of her dissatisfaction with 
        the First Version may have been that so much of the lived experience in 
        the novel was displaced onto other characters or handled obliquely, leaving 
        Eliza’s character weakly motivated.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
        is no surviving complete draft of <i>Godwits </i>from this period; but 
        there are some fragments of typescript. Specifically, there is a 40-page 
        typescript of the “Little Ease” chapter (AU-B12b, fragments 1, 2) and 
        another collection of 81 pages of typescript in the Challis collection 
        of episodes corresponding to the beginning of Part Two of the First Version. 
        These are distinctive in having handwritten annotations by both Hyde and 
        her friend Gwen Mitcalfe.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"
title=""><span>[10]</span></a> Mitcalfe was the person on whom Simone is based 
        in the novel and these passages are the ones involving Simone and Timothy 
        most directly. This is the only case where anyone other than Hyde herself 
        worked directly on the actual drafts of <i>The Godwits Fly</i> as it was 
        being composed. It is evidence that Hyde sought Mitcalfe’s advice and 
        that these passages of the novel at least were receiving particular attention. 
        Further work remains to be done to determine the exact date and compositional 
        order of these “Simone” passages; but most likely they are from May–June 
        1936, when Hyde was recasting the novel in a significantly new shape.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        other surviving materials from this period are two notebooks containing, 
        among much else, handwritten notes and drafts for the novel. Rawlinson 
        ordered and named these Exercise Book 14 (Ex 14) and Exercise Book 15 
        (Ex 15). The Ex 15 notebook of about 100 pages contains a total of 11 
        pages of notes and a list of chapter titles for the novel. Hyde dated 
        one of these pages “July 22nd 1936.” One end of Ex 15 starts with the 
        13 March journal entry, quoted above, and a group of poems. Ex 14 includes 
        a redraft of part of the text. She was evidently working in both Ex 14 
        and Ex 15 at the same time; and old themes were taking a new focus. <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        outline chapter list and “phrase shorthand” notes in Ex 15 are very close 
        to the sequence of the First Version, suggesting that these plans at least 
        are from very early in the revision. Interestingly, this Ex 15 outline 
        gives the novel a three-part structure. This may be the moment at which 
        Hyde went back to the typescript of the First Version, crossed out the 
        Part Two title “Success” and replaced it with “The Middle Distance,” which 
        implies a third Part to come. But the idea of a three-part structure was 
        not pursued. In fact, the whole idea of splitting the story into parts 
        was dropped after this point, possibly because such internal divisions 
        are at odds with the thematic concern for unity and integration.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        next stage in the development of the novel is a manuscript draft (which 
        I have called MS version) that survives in an almost complete form, spread 
        across three more notebooks in the Challis collection (Ex 16, Ex 17, Ex 
        18). This draft establishes the final shape of the novel, though there 
        is still a great deal of detailed change to be made to the text and to 
        the chapter divisions and titles between this and the final published 
        version. The MS version lacks the first two chapters (and possibly an 
        Introduction or Author’s Foreword), which must have existed either as 
        loose pages or in another notebook. There is also a chapter and a half 
        missing between the last two notebooks.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is unusual for Hyde to have handwritten a revision of such a long work. 
        She commonly worked directly onto her typewriter. She must have worked 
        from an earlier typescript however, since large parts of this text follow 
        word for word passages in the revised sections of the First Version. One 
        reason why this draft was handwritten is that Hyde was working on it while 
        she was away from the Lodge, perhaps on weekend stays with friends in 
        Auckland at first, then while travelling further afield.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""><span>[12]</span></a> She went from Auckland to Dunedin 
        by train in late September 1936, staying in a boarding house on George 
        Street in Dunedin and spending time as the guest of the Hon. W. Downie 
        Stewart, writing in the tranquillity of a balcony in his house on Heriot 
        Row. The first of this set of notebooks containing the draft of <i>Godwits 
        </i>also contains notes made in the Hocken Library and notes of discussions 
        with Stewart himself about political history.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span>[13]</span></a> 
        There is also material about Charles de Thierry in this notebook, suggesting 
        that Hyde had first used it before she left Auckland and while she was 
        at work on <i>Check to Your King</i>, which she had completed in 1935. 
        It is possible therefore that the MS version was begun before Hyde set 
        out for Dunedin. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
        There is no known complete draft of the novel after the MS Version. There 
        is, however, the first 137 pages of a typescript draft, which currently 
        exists as two fragments, each in a separate collection. The first, of 
        49 pages, is in the Auckland University Library (AU-B12b fragment 1); 
        the other, of 84 pages, in the Challis collection. This partial draft 
        appears to belong to the revision made over the summer of 1936–37.  While 
        it is possible that it is the remains of a full late typescript draft 
        which is no longer in existence, the short timeframe makes this unlikely. 
        Hyde told Lee the novel was finished in a letter from the Lodge dated 
        16 January 1937 and that she knew it would “crisp out” in the final typing. 
        This she undertook, probably on her new portable typewriter purchased 
        on 25 January, in the baches she stayed in at Whangaroa and elsewhere 
        over the next month or so. The completed typescript of the novel was to 
        be sent to her agent in London “next week,” she wrote to Stewart on 5 
        March 1937. It is not possible to determine when or in what form the Author’s 
        Foreword was added to the text, due to the incomplete state of the drafts. 
        The final typescript sent to A. P. Watt and Son, Hyde’s literary agent 
        in London, does not appear to be extant. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A 
        sliding picture of the days </b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is characteristic of her style that Hyde should have settled so fixedly 
        on the phrase, “the godwits fly” when she began the novel. As a newspaper 
        journalist as well as a poet, she had an ear for a telling phrase. Elsewhere 
        she described her ability to recall events in vivid detail by attaching 
        them to a single image. “I used a kind of phrase shorthand, very simple, 
        unintelligible unless I explained it myself”(<i>Dragon</i>, 281).  The 
        godwits evidently rang true as a piece of “phrase shorthand.” Hyde also 
        had Wednesday Gilfillan warn us that perception is shifty; things that 
        appear to be simple truths have “second selves, split personalities, double 
        faces”(<i>Wednesday</i>,<i> </i>273). These comments point to a symbolic—she 
        would have said poetic—way of layering meaning and perception, which Hyde 
        applied to her writing across genres. Initially she may not have fully 
        grasped what the godwits meant for her, but she was confident that she 
        could enable its significance to emerge. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        was determined to find a way to write “artlessly” or lyrically, to let 
        objects or incidents reveal their particular form and yet, by techniques 
        such as juxtaposition and repetition, to make each image radiate meaning 
        into larger rhythms and patterns. Her notebooks and letters to friends 
        show her constantly on the lookout for new and different approaches. She 
        admired Joseph Roth’s writing, for example, because of its qualities of 
        texture: “<u>His</u> stuff is so detailed that at first it looks solid—then 
        it breaks into <u>pattern</u>, like little leaves . . . I’ve tried for 
        that—the rounding out of things, picture, person, until their separate 
        existence is coherent in the pattern too”(To Schroder, September 1935). 
        She was also pleased when—too rarely—her own skill as a writer was appreciated. 
        Thanking Lee for his review of <i>Passport to Hell</i>, she wrote “You 
        were the first to do what I wanted, to pay some attention to the actual 
        structure of the book”(Lee, 7 August 1936).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
        one of Hyde’s major stylistic concerns was to realise images fully in 
        her work to convey the kind of “crystalline impressions” that Stevens 
        remarked. We can trace this concern a long way back in her writing career. 
        Over the summer of 1927–28 she had been commissioned by the New Zealand 
        Publicity Bureau to write 50 articles on places of interest to tourists. 
        For a short, exciting period she also wrote screen titles for silent films 
        made by the Bureau. She wrote to Schroder: “I go in and watch a wild jumble 
        of scenes which might mean anything.  I have to try to make them into 
        [a] titled sequence”(28 November 1927). That movie-making experience occurred 
        to her later as a vivid way of describing her style in the autobiography 
        she was attempting to write in 1934. It was, she explained to Schroder, 
        “a sort of sliding picture of the days . . . utterly sincere and true, 
        not just my halting truth but the truth of all the faces, tormented and 
        inarticulate and quelled by life, that slid past”(August 1934).<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span>[14]</span></a> 
        When she wrote <i>The Godwits Fly</i> Hyde used the technique with mastery. 
        To take only one example, Eliza’s emotional battle with Simone involving 
        jealousy over Timothy and the need for, and value of, marriage is conveyed 
        entirely by using this filmic technique of a “wild jumble of scenes” in 
        the “Business Girls” chapter. Hyde even foregrounds the method, heading 
        one of these quick scenes “A last shot”—the scene is Simone sitting in 
        the “Fleahouse” watching a “picture show”<i>(Godwits</i> 138).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>“21 
        years of a life” </b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        most relevant formal context for <i>The Godwits Fly </i>is the bildungsroman, 
        or “novel of education,” though the novel has more commonly been read 
        as simply a lightly fictionalised autobiography. Whatever its origins 
        in the material of Hyde’s experience, the novel stands on its own terms 
        as a work of art. A good deal of the work she put into planning and shaping 
        the draft from mid-1936 to early in 1937 went into paring it down, she 
        told John A. Lee, to “21 years of a life”(2 April 1937). Big sections 
        of the early drafts of the novel were cut or rearranged, as described 
        above. The first person narration was transformed into predominantly an 
        omniscient third person point of view, which removed the constraint of 
        a single consciousness within the narrative. The result is a strongly 
        realised set of events and characters arrayed around Eliza so as to set 
        up symmetrical tensions and patterns of conflict and resolution which 
        reflect and define her progress. As bildungsroman, it shows Eliza to be 
        marked out for her special role, her world to be in a troubled state and 
        her education (“the growth of a poet’s mind”) equipping her to engage 
        fully with that turbulence. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        detailed naturalistic texture of the narrative contains the key thematic 
        patterns of the novel. An example is the way Eliza is marked out as the 
        key character. She is not the oldest child in her family, but from very 
        early in the story she makes herself the focus of attention. In the opening 
        pages she and her older sister Carly compete at story telling. Carly has 
        the natural advantage of age: her “memory stretched back” further; but 
        Eliza can “tell things better”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> </i>2). This first encounter 
        prefigures their later relationship as well as setting Eliza on her course 
        as an artist with words. Carly’s dislike of lentils, referred to three 
        times in this first chapter, echoes the archetypal story of sibling rivalry 
        from the Book of Genesis. The elder son Esau sold his birthright to his 
        younger brother Jacob for a pottage of lentils, fulfilling the prophesy 
        that “the elder shall serve the younger”(Genesis 25:34; 25:23). Symbolically 
        it will be Eliza, not Carly, who leads the way to the novel’s meaning.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
        worthiness to lead the spiritual quest for understanding is embedded in 
        the larger structure of the narrative as well as in its allusive detail. 
        In chapter twenty-two, titled “Carly,” the older sister vicariously experiences 
        the traumas Eliza has lived through. Her missed chance of marriage to 
        Trevor Sinjohn and the death of her friend Kirsty Blake parallel Eliza’s 
        lost relationship with Timothy. Witnessing a painful childbirth, she confronts 
        the experience Eliza had endured with the stillbirth of her baby. Carly 
        is moved to tears, but doesn’t have the “courage or the strength”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> 
        </i>224) to go beyond that. The following chapter, “Absalom, My Son,” 
        shows John Hannay’s vicarious pride in Eliza’s success as a poet. He pays 
        deference to her having reached a community with mankind which he had 
        only been able to prefigure in his impulse “to get into the masses who 
        have no consolation but life and death”(<i>Godwits</i>,<i> </i>82). In 
        Eliza’s poems John recognises “a language which all could speak” and “a 
        child could understand . . . or an ageing man”(<i>Godwits</i><b>,<i> </i></b>229).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
        apprenticeship to her art involves her learning to be a poet, and also 
        learning what her subject matter is to be. From being able to “tell things 
        better,” she advances quickly—“Half-way through the war, Eliza became 
        a poet”—and at first comically, rhyming “Hun” with “gun” and “Verdun”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        70–71). In the “Little Ease” chapter she is engaging seriously with poetic 
        form and subject. By the end of the novel she has been published. Her 
        “humble little book,” “Stranger Face,” takes its place among the greats, 
        when it is raised with John’s aid to “the middle of the top shelf” at 
        the bookshop Poetry Counter alongside “a nice set of Browning in vermilion 
        leather covers”(<i>Godwits</i>, 226).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliza’s 
        discovery of the subject matter she is to express unfolds from the experiences 
        and ideas she encounters. Her formal education begins under the tutelage 
        of Mr Bellew, who “talked about the godwits” and their mysterious (“secret”) 
        journey far away (“to Siberia . . . north . . .”). Even in her childish 
        imagination Eliza is able to sense something beyond Mr Bellew’s simple 
        account of geographic distance. She connects that mystery and remoteness 
        with the here-and-now of her own place, sensing “something delicate, wild 
        and far away” which has been obscured by jingoistic nationalism: “You 
        didn’t really have to think about it—Maoris, godwits, bird-of-my-native-land”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        33). Later, in “Little Ease,” Eliza goes further and rejects an education 
        system which is bent on division and dismemberment. She sums this up in 
        the image of a dissected buttercup: “we never do anything by wholes, it 
        is all dismembered like the buttercup, and nobody has the energy to stick 
        it together again”(<i>Godwits</i>, 95).<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span>[15]</span></a> 
        In her own family Eliza sees the same pattern of isolation, conflict and 
        division in the discord between Augusta and John. The fact that a world 
        war rages in the background of her childhood suggests that this is a universal 
        condition. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Alongside 
        Eliza’s formal education are more natural growth processes. Her sixteenth 
        birthday at Day’s Bay, described in “Reflections in the Water,” is a coming 
        of age. The motif of a journey and arrival is picked up in the picture 
        of the <i>Cobar</i> at the Day’s Bay wharf. In the dressing-shed Eliza 
        observes pink flesh, now with “patches of dark, frizzy hair”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        117) and has an insight into how Carly’s sexuality is a vulnerability 
        that will be exploited (<i>Godwits</i>, 115). She is then led by her mother 
        along the “up-path,” beyond a waterfall like a “white bridal veil,” past 
        “two lovers lying in the fern” (“‘And only man is vile,’says Augusta”), 
        then on to the “lazy serenity” of a street full of “old houses.” This 
        is her initiation into the world of “man, woman and child”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        118–119). As they all journey back to the everyday world on the <i>Cobar</i> 
        Eliza recognises in the snatches of community song the subjects with which 
        she must engage.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        characters in the novel ring true to life, but in this aspect of the novel 
        too, what appears to be simple documentary realism resolves unobtrusively 
        into form and structure. The interaction and juxtaposition of characters 
        creates a pattern of figures and “journeys” surrounding Eliza that reflects 
        in various ways on her central “journey.” The major figures in the pattern 
        are two women, Augusta and Simone, and two men, John and Timothy. Together 
        the women reflect Eliza’s exploration of the personal and introspective, 
        while the men reflect her exploration of the social, political and sensory 
        realms.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        Augusta’s life Eliza sees the domestic realm upheld. Augusta’s values 
        of motherhood, security and conformity find their doomed extreme in Carly. 
        Her unfulfilled journey to an idealised England was strongly realised 
        in the First Version of the novel but here it is pushed further into the 
        background. Eliza’s father, John, who was a shadowy presence in the First 
        Version and had been killed off by the end of chapter two, now plays a 
        strong role as a foil to Augusta’s values. The depiction of their fractious 
        marriage is highlighted as essential to the novel’s thematic structure. 
        Augusta’s pride and desire for respectability hold her aloof from her 
        partner and those around her. These negative qualities are the legacy 
        which Eliza has to be able to renounce in order to see value in “the spawning 
        ground of life”(<i>Godwits</i>, 234). On the other hand, Augusta’s “genuine 
        toughness of spiritual fibre”(<i>Godwits</i>, 82) is her positive legacy 
        to Eliza.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        Simone Eliza sees the emerging artist imperfectly reflected. Simone’s 
        experimentation with personal style attracts Eliza but is ultimately empty 
        of real engagement. Simone lacks Eliza’s bravery and willingness to take 
        risks—in relationships as well as in other spheres: “What is the good 
        of love without marriage?” she asks, to which Eliza responds, “What is 
        the good of marriage without love?”(<i>Godwits</i>, 139). If Simone’s 
        negative quality is her timidity, then the positive lesson she has for 
        Eliza is her strong and intact sense of herself and her own needs as a 
        basis for action. Eliza is disappointed that Simone chooses to marry Toby 
        at the end of the novel, until she is able to recognise that Simone and 
        Toby may need the complementary qualities they sense in each other: “she 
        was looking for her lost daemon . . . Queerest of all if Toby turned out 
        to be the daemon. Inside marriage she’ll have a new face, a stranger face”—the 
        last phrase echoing the title of Eliza’s book (<i>Godwits</i>, 234). In 
        their marriage, at which Eliza is bridesmaid in the last chapter, there 
        is the hope of true union and equality in contrast to the isolating tensions 
        between John and Augusta. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">John 
        Hannay’s faith is rooted in the socialist brotherhood of man. So in her 
        father Eliza sees the world through a political frame. His failure to 
        connect this faith with his daily life makes him by turns angry and sentimental. 
        His fantasy of martyrdom for Tom McGrath, his union boss (<i>Godwits</i>, 
        154), is pure sentimentality and his anger is comically parodied in the 
        oafish Olaf. The positive side of John’s legacy to Eliza is his “desire 
        to rejoin the whole”(<i>Godwits</i>, 82), his conviction that the positive 
        driving force of human nature is generated at its most instinctual level. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Timothy 
        drags Eliza at a gasping run into the physical and sensual world. Physical 
        exertion and sexual energy are shot through the various worlds he encounters 
        with Birkett, Damaris Gayte, Shelagh and others.<a
href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span>[16]</span></a> His idealism prevents 
        him, however, from being able to participate unselfconsciously in the 
        everyday world: “he was disappointed when the tramp called him ‘Sir,’ 
        instead of ‘Digger’ or ‘Mate’” (<i>Godwits</i>, 123). As if her own energy 
        has been earthed by his, Eliza risks being trapped in a state of suspended 
        animation under the influence of his keeping her “white, for an ideal”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        123). But his zest for life in all its forms and his willingness to commit 
        without hesitation to the great cause of humanity is a positive influence 
        on her. Eliza reflects this influence in her own discovery that “It doesn’t 
        matter much” what course of life she follows because she is capable of 
        being a “stock now of various goods . . . for everybody”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        235).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        central journey that Eliza makes in the novel is through the experience 
        of alienation (“loneliness”) and loss—first Timothy, then her stillborn 
        baby—to disintegration and beyond these to an integrating self-knowledge. 
        The redemptive possibility she struggles towards is foreshadowed in Timothy’s 
        mythologised journey to the seat of Empire as a “Barbarian for Caesar.” 
        Here he is imagined not as a colonial subject who goes to pay tribute, 
        but as a free citizen of the world in full command of himself: “I have 
        been afraid and made others afraid”(<i>Godwits</i>, 182). He finds his 
        true identity paradoxically by placing himself in the service of a cause 
        greater than just his own. Eliza herself pays a tribute to the Kingdom 
        of the Defeated. Her stillborn baby is the “delicate thing” chosen by 
        the “gods of beauty” to be taken from this world into their realm.(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        209) It is after her baby is born dead that she rediscovers her “old power” 
        to write—now with “a stronger face, an estranged face”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        210). Like Eurydice in Rilke’s poem, “Orpheus, Eurydice, Hermes,” with 
        which the novel concludes (<i>Godwits</i>, 235), Eliza is taken apart 
        from the mundane world and metamorphosed paradoxically into her “undiscovered 
        self.” Rooted now in “the wonderful deep mine of souls,” she can be “given 
        far and wide” as if from an inexhaustible source. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
        “21 years of a life,”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span>[17]</span></a> 
        the bildungsroman leaves Eliza rooted in a deep understanding of the human 
        condition and poised to face a future that is unknown but no longer feared. 
        And she need no longer suffer loneliness, since she shares her fate with 
        all other human beings whose “odd disjointed thoughts about their homes 
        and life’s work were the hermitages in which they dwelt”(<i>Godwits</i>, 
        236). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Part 
        of the reason Hyde was content to concentrate the scope of <i>Godwits</i> 
        was that she intended to connect it to a larger thematic architecture 
        in her subsequent work.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"
title=""><span>[18]</span></a> There is a direct line of succession from Eliza’s 
        self-containment at the end of <i>The Godwits Fly</i> to the “centre of 
        equipoise” Hyde describes in <i>A Home in This World</i>, and elsewhere 
        in her later work (in the poem “The Balance,” written in 1936, for instance). 
        This is a creative and restorative state of mind freed from partisan feeling 
        and divisiveness, and in touch with the most fundamental level of human 
        nature. Individuals in this state are capable of functioning at a high 
        level socially, acting as what another of Hyde’s characters, Macnamara, 
        calls a “stabilising agent” (<i>Nor the Years Condemn</i>,<i> </i>309). 
        In <i>The Book of Nadath </i>(1999), written very shortly after <i>The 
        Godwits Fly</i> was finished, the section called “The Far Flyers” adds 
        resonance to the godwits’ migratory cycle—now two-way—between geographies 
        of the human spirit.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        godwit motif exemplifies how Hyde constantly recontextualised key images 
        and patterns to show evolving thematic preoccupations at work. This “phrase 
        shorthand,” so much a signature of her writing style, draws attention 
        to sites where a particular “effort towards understanding”(<i>Dragon</i>, 
        13) is being made—always for Hyde a joint enterprise between the writer 
        and the reader. The effort is directed at opening up the text rather than 
        pinning it down to a final “meaning,” since, as she wrote in the Foreword 
        to this novel, “Passing judgements . . . is no use at all.”</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
        when Hyde inscribed <i>The Godwits Fly</i> to Gilbert Tothill, “This imperfect 
        part of truth,” she was inscribing her respect for the things that can 
        be known and not known about a life. She was also inscribing her fascination 
        with ways—as a writer and as a reader—of reaching out imaginatively to 
        “our undiscovered selves,” so that the absence of certainty or closure 
        in dealing with our own lives and the lives of others is not alienating 
        but boundlessly integrating and creative. She was also placing herself 
        in the company of other poets and writers whom she felt had the privilege 
        and the duty to be “the organ of the voice, given back to the body, which 
        is the people,” to express the fundamentals of existence in the world 
        of “man, woman and child.” In the words of a fellow poet, Edna St Vincent 
        Millay, to whom she alluded in the Author’s Foreword:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Down, down, 
        down into the darkness of the grave<br>
        Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br>
        Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br>
        I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
        own words live through the power she had to set down sincerely and memorably 
        what it means to be alive.</font></p>

          in Michele Leggott’s editions of <i>The Victory Hymn 1935–1995</i> (1995) 
          and <i>The Book of Nadath</i> (1999). Both exert a gravitational pull 
          back towards the poetry on which Hyde staked her reputation. With sensitivity 
          to Hyde’s synthesising imagination, they employ multi-layered and open 
          ways of presenting and reading textual variants. Leggott’s innovation 
          is strikingly appropriate and relevant to Hyde’s work—so much of which, 
          like Wednesday Gilfillan’s “truth,” has “second selves, split personalities, 
          double faces”(<i>Wednesday</i>, 273), all of which need to be seen and 
          to interplay dynamically, not to be resolved. “It’s also development 
          of a textual strategy to fit the writing practice as encountered in 
          an extensive archive. We are abolishing (as she did) the (Modernist) 
          notion of a single, authoritative text. Whatever rolls through the typewriter

          2, 78).  There is nothing in the extant text of First Version that clearly 
          fits the description of a “very small [Part] at the end.” This passage 
          from the Journal also supports the view that Hyde’s particular difficulty 
          lay in recasting what would become the latter part of the novel in its 
          published form.</font></p>

          reads: “in this book I would like <i>more</i> Eliza and more real Eliza. 
          In satisfying your secret desires by making her more heroic you make 
          the story less real &amp; herself less a person + less appealing. ‘Tout 
          comprendre c’est tout pardonner’ + her faults revealed in truthful narrative 
          draw only sympathy”(AU-B12b, Folder 4 (fragment 2) 154). There was an 
          extensive correspondence between Hyde and Mitcalfe over many years, 
          but little of this remains. The Challis collection has seven letters 
          and some excerpts in transcription included in notes made by Gwen Mitcalfe 
          for Challis (not sighted in preparing this account).</font></p>

          from Rawlinson’s account of events leading to the next known full draft 
          of the novel. Rawlinson highlights a handwritten notebook draft of the 
          chapter, “Reflections in the Water,” dated by Hyde “June 22nd 1936,” 
          as the moment when Hyde made a “breakthrough” which enabled her to reframe 
          the novel (Rawlinson, xiii)—a milestone event as significant in Rawlinson’s 
          reading as Hyde’s “sudden” decision taken on 2 March 1935 to begin the 
          First Version. The view expressed here is that Hyde began the redrafting 
          earlier—about April 1936—and that it was the subject matter and structure 
          of the latter half of the novel that was being re-worked: there was 
          no single “breakthrough” to the new version.</font></p>

          events from her life until she was “only 22”(16 Jan 1937); then in a

          years of a life,” adding “. . . I liked the ending all right”(2 April

          that she had deliberately rearranged the chronology of events based 
          in her own life to produce a particular pattern in the fiction: she 
          wanted to have Eliza “come of age” at the end of the novel.</font></p>
