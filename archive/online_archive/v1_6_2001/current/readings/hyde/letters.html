          in the hinterlands</i>: Robin Hyde's letters to Eileen Duggan</font></b> 
        <p align="left">

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          his book <i>Confessions of a Journalist</i> (1935) Pat Lawlor listed Robin 
          Hyde and Eileen Duggan, alongside Katherine Mansfield, as the “three great 
          New Zealand women writers” (212).  It should be noted that he also called 
          Hyde a “genius” and a “girl” (212), and Duggan a “genius” who had published 
          “two wee books”(198). Eileen Duggan (1894-1972) was best known as a poet 
          — between 1922 and 1951 she published five volumes.  She also had an international 
          reputation as a Catholic writer. Hyde (1906-1939) was a generation younger, 
          and between 1929 and 1939 published as a poet, novelist, journalist, and 
          non-fiction writer.  However, her particular passion was poetry. On 16 
          May 1928 she wrote to her friend and mentor John Schroder, then literary 
          editor of the Christchurch <i>Sun</i>, “I’ll write to Eileen Duggan (of 
          whom I’m a little shy because I’m told that <i>she</i> is shy) and ask 
          her to take tea with me —”, and then a few weeks later reported to him, 
          “But tomorrow I’m going to see Eileen Duggan and am very expectant of 
          a nice afternoon”(7 June 1928).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          admiration and respect for Duggan can best be gleaned from her quite frequent 
          mention of  Duggan in letters to others. Again to Schroder: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I admire 
            Eileen Duggan, who seems to preserve a remoteness and spend precious 
            little time worrying over what tram she’s to catch or how she’s to acquire 
            her new summer hat. (1 Sept 1928)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Duggan’s 
          book of verse <i>New Zealand Bird Songs</i>, and Betty Knell’s <i>As the 
          Story Goes</i>, were both published at the same time as Hyde’s <i>The 
          Desolate Star</i>. Hyde complained to Schroder:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Drat Eileen 
            Duggan: even unto the third and fourth generation, may she be dratted. 
            I don’t mind Betty Knell, but Eileen is abominably good — I mean her 
            verse — isn’t it? But really, it won’t matter — may even make people 
            think about NZ verses and rush out and buy all three little books. Let’s 
            hope so. I have reviewed both for my tomorrow’s page. (Dec 1929/Jan 
            1930?)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
          Pat Lawlor, who in 1937 was Secretary of the New Zealand chapter of PEN, 
          Hyde wrote: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But would 
            you kindly — both in your official and personal capacity — give Eileen 
            Duggan my warmest regards and congratulations on her OBE, also on the 
            new book of her poems which is to ring its bell in London town? Tell 
            her she was one of the New Zealand poets I loved first and most, and 
            still do: and I bagged a line of hers — with quotation marks, of course 
            — to set on the title page of a novel of mine. I am glad about the present 
            distinction, but will be even more so in reading her new book, for she’s 
            a shy creature and one doesn’t hear enough of her. (29 Feb 1937)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          used these two lines from Duggan’s poem “Forerunners”(1929) for the epigraph 
          to her unpublished novel “The Unbelievers”: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We are 
            but stumblers in the hinterlands,</font><br>
            <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Too few 
            for linking hands (see Leggott 1995, 280).</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          letters to Duggan are housed in the Archdiocese of Wellington Archives, 
          in the Eileen Duggan Collection (bequeathed by Duggan). These are the 
          only letters written by Hyde to a woman that are available in the public 
          domain. The six letters reveal and conceal in the same way as her letters 
          to literary men, but also offer a glimpse into Hyde’s desire for a differently 
          written literary friendship.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          first letter is a response to one from Duggan following the publication 
          of Hyde’s own newspaper memoirs <i>Journalese </i>in 1934. Hyde writes 
          from The Grey Lodge, the voluntary wing of the Avondale Mental Hospital 
          (in Auckland) where Hyde had been living since a suicide attempt in 1933. 
          She was still at the Lodge in April 1935 when she responded to Duggan’s 
          request for biographical material for an article on Hyde. Hyde wrote her 
          life repeatedly, in all genres, but it was often what was left out that 
          was most revealing. Here she notably elides two pregnancies, one living 
          son, and the events that led up to her residence at The Grey Lodge.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her 
          letter written in April 1936 from Castor Bay is what I have elsewhere 
          called a “precipice” letter.  Written from the edge, it is a brutal expression 
          of desire and dissatisfaction. Shortly after this letter was written Hyde 
          left the Lodge, and spent the next few years living alone in various places 
          in Auckland (and briefly further north). During this time she wrote fervently 
          and lived poorly, in order that she might travel to England. On 16 January 
          1938, two days before sailing, Hyde wrote to Duggan and poet and publisher 
          Denis Glover.<i> </i>Evidently she was tying up loose ends, as well as 
          in some way ensuring her relationships with New Zealand writers (and affirming 
          her position as one herself). In the letters one senses a tension between 
          the finality of her statements of admiration, respect (and in the case 
          of Glover self-respect); and the already present expectation of a return. 
          Hyde’s letter to Glover was a long ten pages, a confident and fervent 
          response to his lampoon of New Zealand women writers (including herself) 
          in <i>The Arraignment of Paris</i>. To Duggan Hyde offered a note (most 
          likely written after the letter to Glover), an acknowledgement of an unspoken 
          affinity.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          final letter in this collection was written in November 1938. Hyde had 
          spent several months in China on her way to England, become caught up 
          in the war there, and fallen in love with the country and its people. 
          She arrived in England sick and straight away began work on a book about 
          her China experience, <i>Dragon Rampant</i> (published in 1939). Disappointed 
          with England Hyde yearned to return to China, and then New Zealand.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
          23 August 1939 Hyde was found dead in her London flat, the result of an 
          overdose combined with gas-poisoning. She was buried on the 26th at the 
          New Kensington Cemetery, in Gunnersbury.  Duggan continued to live in 
          Wellington until her death on 10 December 1972.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dear 
          Eileen Duggan,</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Thank you for writing. I am so glad that you didn’t think reference 
          to your work — and Jessie Mackay’s presumption in that very slapdash book 
          of mine. I still doubt whether I had any right to speak of the women writers 
          as part of the journalistic story. But I love some of the work that has 
          been done, and people don’t know, or forget. I am glad that they have 
          done something to make a little appreciation plain to Jessie Mackay, though 
          I know that she doesn’t work for rewards.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>No, I have no courage at all — only a wish to do or write something 
          as a sort of toll-fee for passing through life, and not much confidence 
          that I ever shall. I am working on and have nearly finished the draft 
          copy of a somewhat romanticized history of old Baron de Thierry — or at 
          least, it’s romanticized in so far as it takes what he dreamed into account. 
          And sometimes I think it will serve, and sometimes that it is laden with 
          detail and piles misfortunes one on another like a great Pyramid and never 
          will the reader stand for it. The basis is an unpublishable memoir of 
          his own, which I have been able to study in manuscript form. But only 
          sometimes there’s poetry, which is a reward for all the rest.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>My best wishes. And I hope that you yourself are well again, CA

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dear 
          Eileen Duggan,</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I’m typing this because my fist is so consistently awful and your 
          letter asked me to reply “at some length.” It’s very nice indeed of you 
          to think of featuring something about my work in the <i>Women’s Mirror</i>, 
          but when you read the details you’ll probably find them far too higgledy-piggledy 
          for reproduction in any rational journal or periodical.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>But about my poems I’ve had some really good news. Macmillan and 
          Company are bringing forth a book of them, written for the most part during 
          the last two years, to be called, I think, <i>Thine Accursed</i>, and 
          to come forth in a series of theirs named “Contemporary Poets.” CA Marris 
          chose them for me when I was far too ill to attend to it myself, and his 
          selection was what I most wanted. I don’t suppose the book will be out 
          for a few months, as I had to reduce it from seventy to sixty-four and 
          they sent me back the poems for this purpose. They have been re-posted 
          just a week.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I was reading one of the very abstract and etiolated American quarterlies 
          published in Paris last night, and noticed that Mr Ludwig Lewisohn, who 
          is far too interesting to appear in such lustreless company, declares 
          that poetry is a primitive form of expression, prose a much later and 
          acquired art. Perhaps that’s why I prefer poetry to any form of prose. 
          I have something of a dislike for the intellectual who remains strictly 
          limited by his intellectualism, a sort of animated brain-box out of one 
          of HG Wells’ fantasies. Poetry, if it is poetry, comes from body, mind 
          and spirit too. However, this is neither short nor to the point, but I’m 
          in the predicament of having no definite career, merely a choice between 
          two Alice-in-Wonderland rabbit-holes, the first being journalism and the 
          second, months or even years of illness during which I’ve had time to 
          write as I like.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>To begin from the beginning, I was eight when the war started, 
          living with parents and three sisters in a dingy little abode in Berhampore. 
          I’m afraid my literary efforts began in the shape of writing songs of 
          a “patriotic” nature after my father departed. These were horrible but 
          appealed at the time to baser natures of a few schoolmasters and clerics, 
          who patted me on the head until for sheer vanity I had to go on. Apart 
          from that, I had no manner of “encouragement from wise preceptors.” Far 
          from it. I was reasonably good at mathematics and the one love of my childhood, 
          a schoolmaster with a bright red moustache and a passion for hockey, used 
          to bully me about “dropping this verse nonsense.” However, when I went 
          to college and fell under feminine discipline I disliked it a great deal, 
          and ceased to pay any attention to what was told me. The Wellington Girls’ 
          College had a good literary club, the Rangiriri, which offered quite opulent 
          prizes for essays, poems and stories. I went in for these and had a certain 
          amount of success. Apart from that I hated nearly every minute of life 
          at College and thought all the girls barbarians except one, who used to 
          draw excellent devils as illustrations to my poems.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>When I left I was fathoms deep in love with Rostand and William 
          Morris and Stella Benson and the Russian gent who wrote <i>The Created 
          Legend</i>, I think his name was Feodor Solugub. I was a miserable little 
          object with an anti-social bug, and still am, rather, and have kept the 
          bug on as a pet, though at times it really bites.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Thought myself very clever to obtain a position writing a children’s 
          page for the <i>Dominion</i> people, aged sixteen, but was in error. I 
          started off writing various original bits and scraps, and did find friends 
          in the most comradely of worlds. No distinctions, except possibly a column 
          designed to show the more skittish side of the Houses of Parliament. I 
          think that really was a mild success for the time being, anyhow both Ministers 
          and Members read it and the gentlest of them took me down by whiles to 
          the little tearoom in the House and there poured tea and misinformation 
          into me. I still find the House and politics entirely fascinating, even 
          the long drear all-night debates and the Labour repartee. The only thing 
          besides writing which I can achieve is to talk politics, preferably flamboyant, 
          from platform or indoor soap-boxes, but I prefer rather to leap up on 
          impulse than to prepare notes and argue in a reasoned manner.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>However, for a long time I was journalistic Jack-of-all-trades, 
          more so, I think, than any other woman journalist in the country. I’ve 
          written leaders, film pages, fashion pages, book pages, rhymelet-and-tale 
          pages for the young and inoffensive, special articles, travel stuff for 
          the Railways and Publicity Departments, interviews with men ranging from 
          Bishops to criminals. I like interviewing men because it is so easy to 
          put ideas into their heads and words into their mouths, which makes the 
          net result more interesting.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>In Auckland I had to concentrate largely on articles of as sensational 
          a nature as I could dig out of the limpet-like and taciturn public. And, 
          though it’s a low taste, I enjoyed it. There’s only one newspaper feature 
          which I would really like to do, and never have done. I’d like to run 
          a column called “For the Defence,” and tell something of the other side 
          of the world that’s so continually hectored by the police and the Nine 
          Hundred and Ninety Nine amendments to the Ten Commandments. I know them 
          pretty well, partly by having lived in close contact with them.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>However I never was flamboyantly and opulently successful as a 
          woman journalist. The peak of my wealth was when the Wanganui <i>Chronicle</i> 
          paid me £4/10/- a week for lady-editing it and gathering advertisements 
          into its fold. And dimly I realized all the time that like Chico in “Seventh 
          Heaven” I was doing “always the thing I do not want to do.” When, because 
          I had no time to write poetry, I broke down and protested that a would-be 
          poet has a duty to his tribe, as such, (it sounds conceited but isn’t, 
          I mean only the duty of endeavour,) I was laughed at. It amounts to this. 
          Whenever I was well enough, I got jobs in newspaper offices, did the work 
          reasonably well and nearly drove a succession of editors out of their 
          wits. Lady-editing I hate with real venom, partly for petty reasons, as 
          when penetrating into the fastnesses of Government House clad as to paws 
          in 3/11d black mittens, whilst all other females swam gloriously into 
          my ken in elbow-length kid gloves at a minimum cost of 17/6d, and partly 
          because I detest the unpleasantnesses which it involves. I found, in that 
          part of my career, that society consists of the sort who made an awful 
          fuss if you put their names in, and the sort who make an awful fuss if 
          you leave their names out. There seems to me very little to choose between 
          them. There was once a Fair here in Auckland, at which I had the dual 
          duties of reporter and guest. A woman who didn’t like my paper called 
          me over to her stall and in a very loud voice began to tell me all about 
          the points in which it displeased her. She had an audience of Auckland’s 
          brightest and best, male and female. Suddenly and to my horror I began 
          to weep “tears as big as marrowfat peas,” like Kath of Cleeves. One of 
          the young stallholders uttered a cry of “Cats,” and seizing me by the 
          elbow led me away to a refreshment stall where my tears could dilute the 
          lemonade. We marched on to the coconut shies, and though still blinded 
          by tears I brought down five coconuts in succession, greatly to the annoyance 
          of the red-faced Naval gentleman who was almost out of them. However, 
          the coconuts were all bad, so nobody scored. I think this proves that 
          I am not really fitted for the responsibilities of gossip-writing.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The other rabbit-hole is nicer, though uncanny at times. At first 
          I thought it desperately bad luck when I was smashed up at eighteen, and 
          left in a more or less permanently “nervy” condition, but the fact remains 
          that it has been responsible for nearly all the leisure to write that 
          I have ever had. I spent a few months in Sydney once, not then fit enough 
          to make any attempt at professional journalism. As far as I could discover, 
          the few articles I ever submitted to editors were never read, never referred 
          to, never returned. They simply disappeared into limbo. On the other hand, 
          I loved the old Moreton Bay fig trees in Centennial Park, and the lads 
          and lasses riding, slender and brown on their ponies. And in an old hospital 
          which had once been a private home and showed beyond its windows blue-flowering 
          jacaranda trees and a sea of pale glittering lights I started to write 
          poetry again. I had a blest and lonely twelve months down in the South 
          Island, with snow-mountains in my back door and the population mainly 
          consisted of bellbirds and rabbits. I wrote a <i>Sun</i> prize story and 
          poem here, and a good many others. But I don’t in the least regret the 
          harassed and hectic years, and I intend to have more of them. They work 
          in with the leisure times to produce the only good work that I can do. 
          I don’t care for literature divorced from life. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The last two years have been my best opportunity — I’ve done no 
          journalism but a few freelance articles that pay for flowers and cigarettes 
          — but I’ve had time to get a good deal finished. <i>Journalese</i> was 
          the first prose book, and was intended as a friendly farewell to the newspaper 
          world. The poems, and many new ones since CA Marris sent that collection 
          away, came back to my mind. Then in March this year I completed and posted 
          off <i>Check to Your King</i>, which is a biography of the romantic order, 
          about old Baron de Thierry, who well deserved some recollection. That 
          book is entered now for a non-fiction contest in America, and if it doesn’t 
          there succeed in publication will be sent away publisher-hunting elsewhere. 
          In between times I’ve done a series of stories which are in some sense 
          fantasies, “Lonely Street,” which won the <i>Art in New Zealand</i> prize, 
          was one of them, but they’re intended as what Lion Feuchtwanger calls 
          “those fables which hold more truth than reality.” I have the greatest 
          respect for the old folk-tales, both in verse and in prose, not the pretty 
          ones but the kind whose savour is like the smell of newly-chopped wood 
          in a forest clearing. I see no reason why new personalities of fairytale 
          shouldn’t be created, and why old ones, dried and withered in forgotten 
          pages, shouldn’t be interpreted so that they have one foot in the fable 
          kingdom and one in the human city. I love this kind of writing and shall 
          probably try to find an English publisher for the collection soon. Also 
          on the fairytale side but this time for the child only is a little book 
          in which Gloria Rawlinson and I propose to collaborate. It’s to be simply 
          rhymes, about sparrows and hedgehogs and Disrespectful Thrushes and some 
          more. I have never done anything in the way of a Christmas book and I 
          thought it would be fun. The verses are mostly written already and we 
          propose to find an illustrator and seek our fortunes.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>The book I’m doing now is of an entirely different sort. It’s the 
          story of a queer bird, half Red Indian, half Spaniard, a sort of outlaw 
          who has spent his youth in prison and at war, whither he wandered as a 
          boy of fifteen. He lives now in the slums. I think Walt Whitman says something 
          which bears on his story — “There is to me something profoundly affecting 
          in large masses of men following the lead of those who do not believe 
          in man.” I’ve done about half of this book so at present its fate is entirely 
          uncertain, but I want to make a success of it because it touches the three 
          things about which I can be in earnest — health, peace, enlightenment. 
          The three seem to me dependent on one another, and, linked together, the 
          whole structure of citizenship as it ought to be. If such a trinity of 
          ideals can be the core of a writer’s work, they are what I want for mine: 
          though I’d hate a world without humour, and a book which painted life 
          as humourless would be to my mind untrue. I’ve seen it crop up in so many 
          queer places.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I want, then, to write of people as they are and as they consciously 
          or subconsciously wish to be: and of fairytales whose people are true, 
          and of one other thing. It’s only in the last few years that I have grown 
          to understand and appreciate New Zealand, the city life and the background 
          of tussocky hills. I’d like to write something of that. The book about 
          Baron de Thierry tells a good deal of the colour of New Zealand’s early 
          history, the by-ways that didn’t get into official accounts. Though I’d 
          like to write more of that at leisure, the next book I want to do about 
          New Zealand must have the present day as its field.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Remember the magic mushroom down the rabbit-hole? When you nibbled 
          one side you were remarkably small. When you tried the other you shot 
          up over the tree-tops. Don’t you think that writing has much the same 
          effect, only with the minimising side of the mushroom served up much more 
          frequently than the grandiloquent one?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Probably all this long-windedness will not be in the least useful 
          to you. I can’t help it, my career has been so much a la John Gilpin, 
          and there’s such a deal of it which is difficult to touch on. But perhaps 
          you can rescue a few facts from this debris.</font></p>

          </span>I had a letter from Gloria telling me that she met you recently 
          and that you had on a geranium velvet frock and buff-coloured shoes, which 
          sounds very attractive. What did you think of the child? Mr Marris told 
          me there was a very handsome portrait of her in Andrew’s, but I don’t 
          think he had met her. She sent me three lines of a little poem about sparrows 
          which I liked very much. I remember one of yours, published under another 
          name and perfectly delightful — it was called “Saturday’s Child.” And 
          CA Marris as John Dene had one of the loveliest sparrow songs you could 
          wish to meet. Curiously enough I don’t believe I have ever seen a good 
          one written outside New Zealand. Poetry here is so much better and simpler 
          than people seem to realize. I loved an Epiphany one of yours in <i>Best 
          Poems of 1935</i>. (Wasn’t the selection good this year. That anonymous 
          sonnet sequence struck me as the best thing about a house since Thomas 
          Hood wrote a very striking un-Hood-like poem about a haunted one.)</font></p>

          I should have said that my Mother, who is an Australian, has a gift both 
          as a writer and speaker. She never had time to exercise it and won’t own 
          up to it. I believe her grandfather John Sircom was something of a lad 
          in Melbourne’s old days. <i>He</i> used to write poetry of the epigrammatic 
          and sardonic sort and stalk about the city blackguarding his friends in 
          verse, but they always asked him next time because he was amusing. In 
          old age he presided over a little school for demoiselles and surrounded 
          it with a fourteen-foot wall of galvanised iron, with broken glass and 
          spikes on top. He numbers a mad musician of some talent among his descendants 
          but as he really <i>is</i> pretty mad (he keeps dozens of violins stored 
          under his bed) and still lives on, very irascibly, it would be indiscreet 
          of me to say much about him. PPS Will send photograph soon. IW</font></p>

          </span>It’s a splendid article — only far too nice — after the years I 
          have wasted I don’t deserve any commendation. It’s yourself as the only 
          one in New Zealand who has ever, and always, put poetry first.</font></p>

          </span>I do feel that it’s a much nicer critique than I’m worth, but I 
          suppose I mustn’t pull it to pieces on that account! The facts are all 
          in order — the only thing I have the slightest doubt about is whether 
          I’ve unwittingly misled you over the last book, about the man who is half 
          Red Indian, half Spaniard. His life sometimes has been sad, tragic, horrible: 
          not always, and not in will. Whether people will think that his quite 
          genuine idealism atones for the rest, I don’t know. In real life I don’t 
          think “Starkie” will ever have much of a chance. In a book it may be different: 
          or folk may think it’s too hard a book for idealism to lift it up — I 
          don’t know — I think I’ll just leave it to you</font></p>

          for the publication of the poem-book. I think that perhaps a wrong construction 
          might be put on “arranged for,” and I’m really rather proud of the fact 
          that Macmillan’s accepted them outright and are paying a baby advance 
          on royalties day of publication. Naturally I don’t want <i>that</i> bit 
          mentioned, but I’ve written in “has had news of the impending publication 
          . . . Mr CA Marris collected the poems . . .” He was a dear all through 
          my illness, and the poems are dedicated to him, for I owe him the debts 
          of years and years of kindliness — I know he’s one of your very firm friends 
          and admirers. When I was in Wellington and went up sometimes to his house, 
          you were one of the topics almost certain to arise so that, long before

          Eileen Duggan,</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>For one night, I’m not at the Lodge but at Castor Bay, occupying 
          an immense stone sleeping porch with one coal-black handsome mother cat, 
          and two kits, tab and pale mauve. It’s windy and I can hear the sea. Blessed 
          peace! I’d like to write to you, and remain without form and void, only 
          be well, and be happy.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>My sufferings don’t matter much. Most of them are the results of 
          my own vanity, and some of the others I have enjoyed in a way, not being 
          able to care very greatly what the world thought about it. I mean, the 
          world is stupid. It says “Sin,” and you see the rock of a little island 
          with striped queer lilies and a million rooks rather sinister against 
          the sunset — drawing it with them like a reddened net. It says “Shame,” 
          and the little devil inside you knows you get rather a kick out of its 
          raised eyebrows. It says “Suffering” and you see the dearest eyes in the 
          world. It says “death,” and you say “Question-mark?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>What a peroration! Blame the sea outside, and the infinite lovely

          </span>I love <i>your</i> poems: about all I’ve seen, and I wish I could 
          see more. Some day soon you will bring out another book. For you and for 
          me too (please,) there is a goodish Eastern proverb:</font></p>

          </span>Goodnight. I suppose Authors’ Week is being a plague and a nightmare. 
          I am exiled from it, fairly joyously except that at first I’d have liked 
          to dance a little in ye public eye and sell ‘em my books. But all those 
          wagging tongues and wagging beards — are they to make us rich? Not if 
          I know my NZ sales resistance! So instead as soon as I can make my doctor 
          let me I am going to Anawata, the Cave of a Thousand Faces. In summer 
          red trees burn there, but in winter red camp-fires, for one sleeps in 
          the cave and presumably eats mussels. Aren’t shellfish vile, except of 
          course in their own regions? Still the Cave of a Thousand Faces is going 
          to be a consolation.</font></p>

            that which we breathe in, that which is in the air. Think of us sometimes, 
            believe in us, hope that we may be honest, that some of us will touch

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Now just on the eve of going away for my year and a day, and much 
          spent with packing, I want to acknowledge your little Christmas card with 
          a letter or note. But my letters get so silly I must swear to keep this 
          short.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I caught a glimpse of, and picked up, and loved something in, your 
          new green and cream book of poems in Whitcombe’s the other day. Then someone 
          came to tell me my bill was so much, and I had to put it down, but I will 
          see it again in London, and read it slowly. I hope you know I love and 
          respect your work, both poems and the very few but very good short stories 
          I’ve seen — the one about Thomas Bracken, for instance, and another, a 
          long time ago, about Captain Hobson. I would like to see a book of those: 
          it would be a quiet book, but it would be a good and truly strong book.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>You know (it may be my paranoiac instinct to identify things and 
          people with myself, so don’t be insulted, if you violently disagree), 
          I think you and I, though so utterly different in route and all manner 
          of chosen means, work out to somewhat the same equation in the end — but 
          I am clay and you are china (I don’t mean “fragile porcelain,” I mean 
          good honourable china, and for that matter clay not so bad either, though 
          very streaky). But often you say the thing I wish I had said. Anyhow, 
          bless you, as I used indeed to bless you in the days when I first got 
          about the Wellington Public Library, and your first book of poems was 
          the best book of poems there. </font></p>

          I shall be glad to be back: I don’t want to be away from NZ for very long, 
          I like it so that in the event of a Japanese invasion I’ve planned the

          Eileen,</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>Thanks for the little letter. Galatea on the battlefield made me 
          giggle faintly. The Japanese are, I maintain, a surprising people but 
          I think Galatea would have surprised them. Nothing that I ever noticed 
          surprised the Chinese.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>            
          </span>I did not really stay on purpose to have a book, you know — I only 
          hung about a bit too late, partly under a misguided impression that I 
          might be company for the seventy-year-old lady doctor with whom I was 
          staying, partly because, if my Chinese friends had any idea that things 
          were going to march so much quicker than I could run (or they, poor old 
          dears,) they certainly gave me no information about it. But the intrinsically 
          unsound part was that <i>I</i> deserved to get it in the neck, for being 
          there, and they did not. And they got it. It wasn’t so amusing as it must 
          have sounded in the newspapers, or in the articles which I have tried 
          to hack out. There <i>were</i> outrageously funny things that happened, 
          in all quarters, but the trouble is, if you start laughing at one, you 
          suddenly find you’re laughing at all, and then the supreme indecency of 
          laughing at any of it sort of gets you where you live, Anyhow it gets 
          me where I live. Pictures enclosed came to me from a Chinese source and 
          to the best of my knowledge have nothing to do with Hsuchowfu. But with 
          the exception of two displaying executions, there is nothing in these 
          pictures which I did not see in Hsuchowfu — as far as the incendiary bombing 
          stuff is concerned, I saw that not for a handful, but for hundreds. Without 
          colour however I don’t think you get the real effect. Should add that 
          regarding the picture of a Japanese officer making himself pleasant, I 
          never saw any Japanese officer contribute to these performances. The worst 
          I ever saw of Japanese officers was (were?) several in rather bad temper, 
          and a couple tight and fighting in the street. I must say I hoped they 
          would decapitate one another, but of course they didn’t.</font></p>

          </span>Anyhow as Lady Macbeth sensibly remarks, “no more o’ that, my lord.” 
          I’m convinced that if I could think of it much less I’d write of it much 
          better — and I have to do some sort of account: it’s a matter of moral 
          obligation, but I’m so tired. However I’m not half so tired as I was, 
          nor, I guess, a millionth part as tired as those millions in the world 
          who are really trained and disciplined for their mortal combats. You remember

          eternally that Charlie Marris gets a rough deal — he puts a lot in, and 
          gets a very little out, and it’s almost wholly the mean little paltry 
          pricks the <i>Tomorrow</i> crowd give him that puts me off the <i>Tomorrow</i> 
          crowd. It’s false literary economy to be put off any writer or crowd of

          </span>I bagged that bit and one of your <i>Bird Song</i> poems for an 
          article about NZ writers in <i>Tien H’sia</i>, which is the best Chinese 
          periodical to be printed in English. Would send a copy, but I have only 
          the one. The article, called “The Singers of Loneliness” was in their 
          August issue of this year. I met some very friendly, discursive and lovable 
          young Chinese writers, mostly of the student age, but a few seniors, also 
          nice. Would like to do an article about them, but my book is dragging 
          so hard on my wrist and conscience that I’ve done little freelancing since 
          coming to England.</font></p>

          </span>I loved Nellie McLeod’s article on Jessie Mackay, in a recent <i>Tomorrow</i>. 
          (<i>Tomorrow</i> still sends me <i>Tomorrow</i>, though we have severed 
          diplomatic relations. I’m not sure if they do it because they still love 
          me, or still hate me, but it doesn’t matter much.) I’m ashamed to say 
          I have had no chance of reading your last book of poems. But I got a Christchurch 
          <i>Press</i> containing a review, and, my word, you certainly have made 
          JHES come out of his shell a bit! And that was good — John’s praise is 
          worth having.</font></p>

          </span>I hope the awful meeting passed off without a tremble. Gloria Rawlinson’s 
          novel is another book I haven’t yet laid hands on, though I read it in 
          ms — in several mss, to be exact. Her mother seemed a little depressed
