        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          chapter starts out with the question of how readers should position themselves 
          to see meaning and unity in Robin Hyde’s later works, 1936-39. These works 
          seem problematic both because they are so diverse and because they are 
          such a departure from her earlier production. Familiar readings include 
          attempts to see her as a nationalist or as a feminist. This chapter is 
          an attempt to develop a different kind of political reading. It retains 
          aspects of previous readings but takes a different approach to reconstructing 
          the 1930s political/historical contexts, both national and international. 
          Like previous feminist readings, it focuses on Hyde’s construction of 
          herself as a female intellectual and her interest in the representation 
          of women but when it discusses gender it tries to do so with specific 
          reference to the 1930s political context. In this way it tries to transcend 
          the familiar debate between feminist and nationalist readers, and the 
          limitations of the way in which Robin Hyde had been “restored” by recent 
          critics.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          can indicate the limitations of the way Robin Hyde has been “restored” 
          by discussing an anecdote told by New Zealand/Australian novelist Ruth 
          Park in her 1993 autobiography <i>Fence</i> <i>Around</i> <i>the</i> <i>Cuckoo.</i> 
          During the depression, because of financial circumstances, Park was forced 
          to leave school to live with her parents in a “backblocks” area of the 
          King Country:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Life is 
            never speedy enough for the young, especially the despairing young. 
            I did read the living-room walls, standing on a chair, hunting for consecutive 
            pages. These came from very old copies of the <i>New</i> <i>Zealand</i> 
            <i>Observer,</i> and the text was solid Robin Hyde, whose style became 
            so familiar to me I believe I could even now recognise it anywhere. 
            How I envied her, secure in her job, praised as a poet, with a beautiful 
            future. But in fact at the time she was overworked, ill-paid as all 
            women journalists were, worried about her child, always in pain from 
            a diseased bone, and planning suicide.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A year 
            or so later, too shy to speak, I was to pass her in a newspaper office, 
            unfortunate Robin, a lame, worn-looking woman, pale and ill nourished, 
            with lank light brown hair. It must have been just before she left for 
            China, a journey that led to her early death.<i><sup><a name="note2"></a> 
            <a href="#end2">[2]</a></sup></i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Could 
          this example of a shift in understanding about Robin Hyde’s life have 
          come about without her “restoration”? Ruth Park has clearly read Derek 
          Challis’s description of his mother’s plight in the introduction to <i>A</i> 
          <i>Home</i> <i>in</i> <i>this</i> <i>World</i> as well as Hyde’s own description 
          in that work. The update is significant because it is only latterly that 
          the circumstances of Hyde’s life were seen to be important to understanding 
          her work. However, the outcome is not very satisfactory—the way that Ruth 
          Park opposes her once naive assumptions about the successful journalist, 
          to the painful reality, seems to me to be not only patronising but also 
          unhistorical. Park’s double-take is matched by what has happened in Hyde’s 
          feminist rereading, which—because of the interest in Hyde’s suppression 
          as writer and woman—risks a sense of special pleading. It also gives a 
          tragic tone to the work that may have other possible aspects. A more detailed 
          reconstruction of the 1920s and 1930s may suggest that this was not so 
          much a tragic individual situation as part of social life, especially 
          women’s life, at this period. Park hints at this period context with her 
          phrase “as all women journalists were” but her focus is on the “unfortunate 
          Robin.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another 
          example is helpful here. An MA student who, like Hyde, had experienced 
          the death of a baby, presented a seminar in which she put manuscript material 
          from Hyde’s “Autobiography” (manuscript MSS 412 held in the Auckland Public 
          Library) alongside the veiled account of losing a baby in <i>The</i> <i>Godwits</i> 
          <i>Fly. </i>She then suggested that a number of Hyde’s poems are also 
          about this heartrending experience, particularly the experience of never 
          being able to hold the dead child.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note3"></a> <a href="#end3">[3]</a></sup></i></span> 
          She finished the seminar with a reference to a claim in MacD. P. Jackson’s 
          survey essay on New Zealand poetry in the <i>Oxford</i> <i>History</i> 
          <i>of</i> <i>New</i> <i>Zealand</i> <i>Literature </i>that “. . . no New 
          Zealand poet would have thought of writing a poem about being pregnant 
          and losing the child,” a claim which seemed to ignore Hyde’s poems on 
          that very theme.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note4"></a> <a href="#end4">[4]</a></sup></i></span> In 
          showing a critic’s blindness to the existence of certain subjects in literature 
          this student was linking her example with the feminist argument that female 
          writers and female experience had been suppressed by male critics. But 
          Jackson’s claim could be debated in other ways. For instance he ignores 
          the significance of radical attempts during the 1920s and 1930s to relate 
          literature to the lives of ordinary people. This was an international 
          trend which also touched New Zealand. Perhaps the interpretation we make 
          of Hyde’s writing should not focus exclusively on gender but acknowledge 
          the radical democratic spirit in her writing.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Even 
          Patrick Sandbrook’s thesis, <i>A</i> <i>Writer</i> <i>at</i> <i>Work,</i> 
          which uncovers subtle interconnections between Hyde’s unpublished letters 
          and autobiographies and her novel <i>The</i> <i>Godwits</i> <i>Fly,</i> 
          still uses an old-fashioned literary critical mode. Thus Robin Hyde is 
          identified as a gifted individual struggling within a narrowminded society, 
          rather than a writer whose choice of material, preoccupations and genre 
          tendencies were shaped by her context, as much as she herself shaped these 
          elements. I cite these examples not to criticise individual critics but 
          to draw attention to the way readings have changed their emphases in recent 
          years. Obviously other types of reading (including more heavily theorised 
          and less personal types) are also current, but it is the tragic and heroic 
          modes that have attracted most attention; and indeed without them it is 
          likely that the Hyde revival would not have had so much impact. My point 
          here, however, is the familiar tendency for revivals to oversimplify their 
          topic by adopting an adversarial approach. What kind of reading can transcend 
          the dialectic thus produced?</font></p>
        <p class=HideBody align=left style='text-align:left;
  line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is no longer necessary to argue for the importance of Hyde’s work, but 
          one does need to look more closely at the writing in its original social 
          and political context. This is, however, not a simple matter: a complex 
          historical view is needed. We cannot turn to some neutral history to make 
          a recontextualisation. The post-Second World War picture of the 1930s 
          and 1940s as a time of cultural birth is a story that has been told not 
          only by novelists and poets but also by historians, so that we also need 
          to recover the period from their mythmaking. Nationalist historians, like 
          feminist historians, are naturally driven by their particular values and 
          priorities. For instance, historian Bill Oliver in <i>The</i> <i>Oxford</i> 
          <i>History</i> <i>of</i> <i>New</i> <i>Zealand</i> celebrates this time 
          of cultural birth when “a magazine, an orchestra and a small [literary] 
          fund” came into being.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note5"></a> <a href="#end1">[5]</a></sup></i></span> 
          But even in his acknowledgements of the role of women in this enterprise 
          he seems unconsciously grudging, as when he describes a group of women 
          painters as “eminent among the more modest participants in the revolution 
          of the 1940s” but as “cautious painters, attaining an authentic personal 
          vision within a narrow compass.” And again, though he admits that they 
          did transcend the limitations of being “beneficiaries of that colonial-genteel 
          tradition that made it acceptable . . . for middle class girls to occupy 
          themselves with paint,” he also stresses that they did not “break new 
          <i>g</i>round”<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note6"></a> <a href="#end6">[6]</a></sup></i></span>  
          What Oliver’s comments lack is an interest in distinguishing between the 
          traditional “amateur” and “hobbyist” status of women artists and their 
          actual production. His narrative is so much concerned with national discovery 
          that other subtle forms of innovation are overlooked.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fortunately 
          in the last five years the historical view has been enlarged. Other works 
          by Robin Hyde have been republished and studies such as Rachel Barrowman’s 
          <i>A</i> <i>Popular</i> <i>Vision:</i> <i>The</i> <i>Arts</i> <i>and</i> 
          <i>the</i> <i>Left</i> <i>in</i> <i>New</i> <i>Zealand</i> <i>1930-1950</i> 
          <i><sup><a name="note7"></a> <a href="#end6">[7]</a></sup></i> and a range 
          of essays on women in the 1930s have looked at issues such as unemployment 
          and contraception, and allowed us to develop other angles on the period.</font></p>

  line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>          
          </span>To further our political reading let us start with a consideration 
          of Hyde’s approaches in 1936-38 when she wrote her last two novels, <i>The</i> 
          <i>Godwits</i> <i>Fly</i> (1938) and <i>Nor</i> <i>the</i> <i>Years</i> 
          <i>Condemn</i> (1938). These both treat the post-war and depression periods—<i>Godwits</i> 
          ends with the tramping feet of unemployed men, circa 1928, and <i>Nor</i> 
          <i>the</i> <i>Years</i> <i>Condemn</i> finishes with the Labour election 
          in 1935. Both are distinctly pleas for the underdog, the poverty-stricken, 
          the one who has no expectations of life. This theme was not Hyde’s alone. 
          What we think of as the most significant poems and stories of the 1930s 
          speak to it too: for instance, Allen Curnow’s “House and Land,” Denis 
          Glover’s “Magpies,” and Frank Sargeson’s “Piece of Yellow Soap.” Clearly 
          there was a strong political streak in nationalist writing. Discovering 
          one’s own country should not be thought of as a purely nationalist discovery 
          but also as a complex political one. Hyde herself seemed to be in no doubt 
          in 1937 that the best writing should comment on society. She argues for 
          Katherine Mansfield as a sociological and political writer, too seldom 
          appreciated as such: “New Zealand hasn’t achieved any writers whose writings 
          have an exceptional political or sociological value—except Katherine Mansfield, 
          and nobody ever seems to notice that aspect of her genius.”  Hyde saw 
          her most importantly as making “a picture of the structure of society.”<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note8"></a> <a href="#end8">[8]</a></sup></i></span> 
          She also reproved Denis Glover for a posturing gloominess that was, she 
          thought, obligatory for the “strictly-modern school” and fostered from 
          a romanticised idea of waiting for revolution (“the necessary economic 
          uprising”) but which she implies has little relationship with real international 
          tragedies, “the bloody duels in Spain, or in Abyssinia, [which] bear witness 
          to the insecurity of the present.”<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note9"></a> <a href="#end9">[9]</a></sup></i></span></font></p>
        <p class=HideBody align=left style='text-align:left;
  line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Patrick 
          Sandbrook has argued for the deliberate choices Hyde made as a writer. 
          He also stresses her sense of “democracy” with her readers. I would want 
          to go further and suggest that the method other last novels and poems—which 
          includes stylistic innovation, experiments with montage, and the inclusion 
          of documentary material—can be seen as belonging to a widely shared impulse 
          to convey the new character of the time by breaking down boundaries between 
          fiction and documentary. In this way one can argue that Hyde was in fact 
          very like many of her Australian and American contemporaries who had a 
          new conception of the novel, not so much as an expression of individual 
          genius but as a text which captured history as a spotlight which flashes 
          for a moment on an individual and an environment, a “record” of her time. 
          Some local critics have described Hyde’s last novels as using two modes, 
          the visionary (or Utopian) as well as the social realist, but again the 
          wider international context of politically identified writing gives us 
          a way of seeing Hyde’s Utopian monologues as part of the whole text—the 
          novelist’s attempt to paste intellectual discourse into her collage of 
          the period, an impulse typical of a new genre of radical writin<u>g</u>.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note10"></a> <a href="#end10">[10]</a></sup></i></span>  
          The monologues in <i>Nor</i> <i>the</i> <i>Years</i> <i>Condemn,</i> for 
          example, can be seen as Hyde’s attempt to explore the current problems 
          of the thinker and writer in a time of social unrest.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">An 
          Australian cultural critic, David Carter, in an essay titled “Documenting 
          Society,” describes radical fiction from the 1930 to the 1950s as breaking 
          down the distinctions between “fact” and fiction by opening up the novel 
          to “a new social reality—at once individual and historical.” <i><sup><a name="note11"></a> 
          <a href="#end11">[11]</a></sup></i> Detailed descriptions of work and 
          workplaces, broken narratives, extracts from personal journals or newspapers, 
          radio dialogues and popular songs, and Utopian passages all occur in a 
          novel typical of the time (he is describing Alan Marshall’s <i>How</i> 
          <i>Beautiful</i> <i>are</i> <i>Thy</i> <i>Feet).</i> By looking at such 
          writing as a collage, he argues, we are discovering not its naturalism 
          so much as its modernity.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Nor</i> 
          <i>the</i> <i>Years</i> <i>Condemn</i> elides fact and fiction because 
          the protagonist, Starkie, is based on a real person whom Hyde knew and 
          interviewed. Likewise within the novel there is a brief mention of a young 
          woman journalist who, it is implied, could be associated with the author 
          of the novel. While the characters Bede Collins and Macnamara could possibly 
          be associated with “real people” they can also be seen as the author’s 
          way of formulating the relations between the intellectual and society. 
          For instance, one could go through the narrative and find plenty of connections 
          between Hyde and the character of Bede. Bede is an experienced woman in 
          terms of relations with men but also a woman alone, and one who wants 
          to minister to her country—as Hyde the journalist and novelist did. Bede 
          is a nurse not squeamish of physical suffering and squalor—she, like Hyde, 
          has been through some of the worst of experiences and can look at suffering 
          open-eyed. There is an even more specific connection in that the protagonist 
          in Hyde’s supposedly autobiographical account of drug addiction, <i>A</i> 
          <i>Night</i> <i>of</i> <i>Hell,</i> is also called Bede. And Bede in both 
          novel and essay lives in a tiny bach lighted at night only by candles. 
          The connections between texts and life are myriad. Readers and critics 
          are endlessly fascinated by them.<i><sup><a name="note12"></a> <a href="#end12">[12]</a></sup></i> 
          Yet questions remain about these representations that are not answered 
          by recourse to “fact” or biography. Instead perhaps we should think about 
          both autobiography and fiction as contemplations (necessary to the period) 
          on the role of the female outsider or intellectual, and a consideration 
          of the difficulty of being political and middle class. And perhaps middle 
          class and poverty-stricken. The example below follows the character (Bede) 
          rescuing a baby hedgehog:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She left 
            the saucer outside, went in, and read the <i>Communist</i> <i>Manifesto,</i> 
            with six prefaces by Engels. It convinced and depressed her. The Communists—Brigadier, 
            <i>vous</i> <i>avez raison:</i> but what the devil were they going to 
            do with people like herself, riddled with good intentions and emotions, 
            like old ships riddled with rats? Oh, well: she supposed they might 
            sink her for a breakwater somewhere, and anyhow, the individual was 
            not proving so important. Certainly she liked the Communists much better 
            than their opposite extreme.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note13"></a> <a href="#end13">[13]</a></sup></i></span></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          passage ends with a return to Bede’s anxiety about the hedgehog. When 
          she found its saucer empty “she regretted not having been able to keep 
          the baby.” The placement of Bede’s monologue alongside the animal rescue 
          (and the human resonances of “baby”) reinforces her predicament as having 
          the problems of specifically a female thinker and intellectual: one who 
          has the impulse to mother and comfort but who at the same time wants to 
          see the world in larger perspective. I am suggesting, therefore, that 
          a connection between a real and the fictional character should not be 
          seen as simply hiding the “secret story” of the author but rather as opening 
          up both character and author to history as positively as possible, so 
          that both can be seen not as merely “representing subjectivity” but as 
          “sites where social forces and ideologies play out their effects.”<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;

          Macnamara journeyed from one end of the country to the other. <i><sup><a name="note15"></a> 
          <a href="#end15">[15]</a></sup></i> And he could also be seen as based 
          on one of, or a composite of, a new idealistic, questioning group of young 
          men—thinkers, artists and politicians whom Hyde describes in an essay 
          on New Zealand writers: “its [the depression’s] stimulating effect on 
          the thought and culture of rebellious young minds, in a silent country 
          which at last learned to be articulate, was probably worth all the hardship 
          involved.”<i><sup><a name="note16"></a> <a href="#end16">[16]</a></sup></i> 
          She is probably thinking of figures such as John A. Lee, Joe Heinan, John 
          Beaglehole, Eric McCormick—figures who seemed capable of putting into 
          action the sense of spiritual and material urgency that the depression 
          stirred up. (Even in 1936 they were starting to work on a centennial publication 
          that would put New Zealand on the map as a cultural entity. They were 
          the kind of thinkers who went on after the war to institutionalise the

          again, rather than getting caught in the anecdotal, perhaps we should 
          see the invention of Macnamara as a way of including a Utopian discourse 
          in the book. Macnamara is looking for the right model for the future; 
          his travel parallels Starkie’s, but Starkie has been programmed with outmoded 
          ideas which means that his solutions always go awry. Macnamara ministers 
          to others; he solves and salves moments of rancour. He rescues a “Homie” 
          in a small-town pub and takes him back to the house that he lives in. 
          The setting is the Ureweras, the township is Wairoa. This early settler’s 
          house has the “right” relationship to the country in which it is built:  
          Macnamara is able to appreciate its history, which the “Homie” also glimpses 
          for the first time. On the walls are maps of New Zealand, which allow 
          the two men to familiarise themselves with the country, its landforms, 
          its produce:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The flickering 
            lamplight revealed a house of old steady dignity, which, despite its 
            emptiness and its corridors fit for ghosts, pleased the Homie better 
            than anything else he had seen since coming to New Zealand. Two big 
            maps, one of the North Island, one of the South, with little Stewart 
            Island tacked on down under, showed up on one of the bare walls, which 
            was of unpainted, unvarnished wood, the solid and honest tree. The roof 
            was very high, and the stove, which Macnamara lighted to make coffee, 
            as rusty as it was immense. In the corner stood a harmonium.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><i><sup><a name="note18"></a> <a href="#end18">[18]</a></sup></i></span></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Macnamara 
          advises the settler to also familiarise himself with methods of farming 
          and to gradually make a decision on his own land purchase: “You see the 
          maps? In your spare time I’d like you to study them back, front and round 
          the corner. They’ve got products marked in, and a good many other things.”<i><sup><a name="note19"></a> 
          <a href="#end19">[19]</a></sup></i>< Macnamara is an image of the astute, 
          informed, compassionate citizen whose forward thinking will overcome the 
          problems associated with the returned soldiers (from the First World War) 
          and the depression. How he lives combines the right mix of nonmaterialistic 
          elegance and consciousness of history that should become a model for the 
          nation, just as his generous handling of the blokes in the pub should 
          become a model for the relations between people. His gentle gesture of 
          covering Starkie with a coat later in the story, when Starkie is reduced 
          to a night in a “shelter,” also recalls Hyde’s picture of John, the father 
          in <i>The</i> <i>Godwits</i> <i>Fly</i>—a similarly socially committed 
          character, who tiptoes in at night to cover his daughter with his overcoat.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yet 
          Macnamara’s portrayal is not only an obviously nationalist construction, 
          it is also an internationalist one. The question of how a writer should 
          contribute to a society (and a world) felt to be in crisis was an international 
          one. This question was also important to other local writers. In her section 
          of the introduction to <i>Nor</i> <i>the</i> <i>Years</i> <i>Condemn,</i> 
          “Hyde’s Masquerade,” Linda Hardy says of Hyde’s approach: “Unlike Mulgan, 
          or the early Sargeson, Hyde is not merely content to imply the limitation 
          of the gruff pragmatic masculine voice. Instead she makes these other 
          voices [of Bede Collins and Macnamara] carry the metaphors of Utopian 
          desire.”<i><sup><a name="note20"></a> <a href="#end20">[20]</a></sup></i> 
          The comment is convincing, yet it is important to stress what Hardy is 
          assuming here: that all three of these writers were working in different 
          ways on the same problem of how the bourgeois intellectual can relate 
          to society—how he or she can engage a receptive audience for their work, 
          how to be loyal to the working class, and also how to promote and lead 
          changes in society. Critics have spent so much time debating nationalism 
          in literature that they have not noted all the ways in which it connects 
          up with international trends and debates—such as the debate about the 
          future, or not, of socialism, or the practice of new kinds of social organisation.

          Nick Perry, on the other hand, attributes the fracture in meaning mostly 
          to cultural dislocation caused by displacement. The social dilemma of 
          the provincial was the problem of sounding too smart and patronising for 
          New Zealand audiences or too “down home” for English ones. Bill Pearson 
          described it as an uneasy choice between sycophancy (writing in a “nervous 
          tie-straightening” way for the English market) or overconfidence (“attitudinising”

          it is not easy for us to return to being the kind of reading community

          was eclipsed by war, and then by postwar nationalism, the post-war baby 
          boom, and the 1950s cult of the family, not to mention the consolidation

          suggestion that this juxtaposition of immediate and broad perspectives 
          (in time and space) helps to describe an inexplicable urban world, and 
          a world in crisis, is reinforced by the fact that the characters are engaged 
          in their own kind of struggle to understand their place in history: their 
          attempts at perspective open their minds to other lives and other stories, 
          to the whole social field so complex and difficult to sum up in abstraction.</font></p>

          about John because the picture of the emperor looks like “Daddy in a temper,” 
          putting the children presumably in the place of those “raw pink rabbits.” 
          The father sees class tyranny, the daughter, tyranny of father over children, 
          and possibly one sex over the other. The image of pink rabbits soaking 
          overnight also reminds Eliza of Augusta’s attempt to nourish their family 
          in times of poverty. The final “Two people, solitaries, dreamers” is a 
          kind of time-lapse narrative seen by the older woman narrator (implied, 
          though not present, the older Eliza). The two figures fight over their 
          ideological positions in a dialogue similar to that Hyde uses in her long 
          poem “Husband and Wife” which was written in 1936. The passage brilliantly

          excess in these details draws attention to itself as more than is strictly 
          necessary to advance the narrative, and also suggests that the narrative 
          is not clearly separate from the “real” world outside the novel. Conceptually 
          it challenges any idea of fiction as a single perspective; it hints to 
          the reader that fiction can choose the events it foregrounds or backgrounds. 
          The effect is to suggest that this author has selected details with an 
          awareness of the difficulty of interpreting the world. Overconfidence 
          (even of the importance of the individual) would be dangerous when so 
          much of life has been altered by war and depression, and now the possibility 
          of more war. Another passage describes the contemporary relations between 
          men and women as epitomised in the scene at a cafe, Gamble and Creeds, 
          on a wet working day where “everyone ate hurriedly in a good smell of 
          coffee and a bad one of stinking rubber-lined mackintoshes.” Once again 
          it emphasises the juxtaposition of different perspectives:</font></p>

            little faces, they had; queer, bonded race, so helpless and yet so powerful. 
            Women, a minority, sat alone, reading books propped up against the drip-nosed 
            nickel teapots. It was interesting to watch them come in. They always 
            looked about for a table where there was nobody, crossed the whole length 
            of the room to find one - as if a ghost occupied the seat opposite. 
            They were all business girls. Many kept sentimental trysts with themselves, 
            pinning bunches of daphne or heavy-fragrant brown boronia on their costumes. 
            The men fraternized, talking shop. Flying particles of it came over—stock 
            exchange, politics, smut, all on a harder, crisper plane than the feminine 
            talk though you could spot a goodly percentage of bores. It wasn’t that 
            the men weren’t ignorant, but they had the courage of their gutturals. 
            It was evident at once that they had a life apart from the women. The 
            women—they had the toy boxes called their homes, the rag dolls called 
            their babies; or the business ones had a room (“the flat”), with a pink 
            lampshade. . . . The value of men to women was plain in everything they 
            did; even among these close-faced women, who watched unobtrusively as 
            a cat watches. The value of women to men was debatable. If women weren’t 
            there, Eliza had a feeling the men would continue to talk shop for about 
            ten years before they noticed anything. Then presumably they would want 
            some fresh tea . . . or to reproduce their kind. Unless they had killed

            decided they hated one another. The girls said they were content with 
            their jobs, and took expensive beauty treatments. The men lounged together,

          for example Frank Sargeson’s marriage portraits, and particularly his 
          portrait of Bill in “That Summer.” Bill, like Starkie, feels an obligation 
          to be married; both men think that is what women want—so they had better 
          want it, too. Their actual feelings are momentary, fleeting. In the above 
          passage Eliza, the young woman writer, is keen to disassociate herself 
          from this kind of stand-off between the sexes. She focuses particularly 
          on the pathetic aspect of the women, their need for men who don’t need 
          them, their sentimental trysts with themselves. These are humiliating 
          role models. Hyde illustrates her own very different take on what should 
          be the relations between men and women in a number of ways—by showing 
          that a woman such as Eliza can be different, can enjoy talking shop, can 
          have a career, can enjoy camaraderie and adventure, can want sex not marriage, 
          and, in interesting contrast to later feminism, can want a baby not an

          reason that Hyde’s last novels, one with a female protagonist and the 
          other with a male, include juxtapositions of male and female perspectives, 
          expectations and misunderstandings; in short, men’s and women’s ideas 
          about each other and sexual difference. Thus the New Zealand crisis mentality 
          which despaired about relationships between men and women […] [and] feared 
          race demise (both Maori and European) could be seen as very much part 
          of an international moment and not simply as the inheritance of a misogynist 
          pioneer society. It is the contention of Mary Louise Roberts (in her <i>Civilisation</i> 
          <i>Without</i> <i>Sexes:</i> <i>Reconstructing</i> <i>Gender</i> <i>in</i> 
          <i>Postwar</i> <i>France)</i> that at this period “thinking about women 
          (and thus about sexual difference) was a way of thinking about the war 
          and the new social and economic realities that had ensued.”<i><sup><a name="note45"></a> 
          <a href="#end45">[45]</a></sup></i> Roberts is suggesting that very often 
          the discourse produced by “thinking about women” was in contradiction 
          with what was actually happening in the social and economic sphere. I 
          would see Hyde as both recording some contradictory aspects of this “thinking 
          about women” and also as participating in it, bound up necessarily with 
          what were the contemporary ways of thinking about the future. Hyde offers 
          a “gem” of popular discourse about women in <i>Nor</i> <i>the</i> <i>Years</i>

          </span>Robin Hyde’s poem “Husband and Wife” is a case in point.  This 
          long poem is a dialogue between “HE” and “SHE” that suggests an ongoing 
          or long-term debate. It appears to borrow its form from the dialogue poems 
          of Robert Frost, and was written in 1936, published in <i>The</i> <i>Caxton</i> 
          <i>Miscellany</i> in 1937 and collected in <i>Houses</i> <i>by</i> <i>the</i> 
          <i>Sea</i> in 1952. It is a poem little commented on, and never anthologised, 
          perhaps because it is so involved with debates of the period and needs 
          contextual explanation. In May 1936 Hyde was writing to John A. Lee on 
          the subject of political commitment in writing and writing style. In response 
          to Lee’s suggestion that she use themes that have “the hot news value 
          of 1936” and write about local struggles of working lives (the “axe in 
          the woods and the crane on the wharf”) she demurred that she found it 
          hard to write of “the vanquished” in her poetry, and then went on to describe 
          her own experience of living in Redfern, Sydney in 1926 (when pregnant 
          with her son, Robin):</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her next letter she speaks of the conflict between desiring (or needing) 
          social change and the possibility of making a comfortable niche for oneself 
          in society: “enduring all the aches of this rotten system” and yet being 
          socially in tune with if. She goes on to ascribe love for the old prosperous 
          pleasurable life as a “gentle sort of mist” that “can soften rough edges” 
          and acknowledges that “women do love like that, a good deal.” There is 
          an internal conflict indicated in her letters as if she feels the era 
          when life can be understood in terms of the individual is over (and needs 
          to be for the sake of the future) but she does not want that to be so. 
          (Yet, there is also an interesting ambivalence in her attitude to Lee’s 
          mentoring.) In the poem, as in the letters, this conflict is enacted in 
          a gendered political discussion about the importance of the individual 
          versus society. The husband and wife’s exchange can be understood as “a 
          domestic,” one of those rows that comes from irritation with the familiar 
          responses of a spouse to familiar stresses, the sort of argument that 
          could potentially lead to physical violence. Their debate is about how 
          best to respond to their own predicament. It is implied that their situation 
          involves financial, emotional, and personal entrapment. Their row is an 
          outcry about that oppression. How to live? “HE” is a political intellectual 
          who feels it his duty to think constantly about the political problems, 
          and suffering of the day. “SHE” sympathises with his politics but also 
          wants some personal happiness. The possible choices are complicated by 
          jealousy and tenderness. When his wife goes out walking, the husband is 
          jealous of what he sees as her escape into nature. But is his conception 
          of thinking and feeling for “man” necessarily more “real”? He wants to 
          be made to feel alive by pain. She wants the healing of a leaf. Where 
          is the right course? Where is reality? And how to distinguish it from 
          didactic or melodramatic versions of “Reality” (with a capital “R”)?</font></p>

          the dialogue, as the husband curses his wife’s “treachery,” her disappearance 
          into another “softer” world, he describes that world so carefully that 
          one is reminded of R. A. K. Mason’s “Footnote to John ii, 4” in which 
          the son describes, gradually, tenderly, the rotten overprotective way 
          in which his mother used to tuck him up at night. If “Footnote to John 
          ii, 4” is about a struggle to be able to accept love, so is “Husband and 
          Wife.” There is jealousy and pain as well as a sense of failure here: 
          this is male authority without any power except to command suffering and 
          to suffer—because suffering is the only dignified course. She acknowledges 
          the predicament; though perhaps in a way that might irritate him: “God 
          meant us to be very baffled now.” And she also understands his tenderness 
          when she uses his description in the last lines of their dialogue: “You 
          say my hair/ is osier leaves. See how its shadow spreads/ Across the farthest 
          star, and covers us.”</font></p>

  200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Amongst left-wing 
          intellectuals of the period the exchange would have been a familiar one 
          about political commitment versus faith in natural beauty, art, love or 
          aesthetics. In the letter to John A. Lee, Hyde suggests that this is as 
          an argument she frequently has with herself. She describes a “pull” away 
          from needy people “to books” or “enormous old trees.” <i><sup><a name="note50"></a> 
          <a href="#end50">[50]</a></sup></i> It is a pull that she feels guilty 
          about as escapism, “a continual over-stressing of the importance of individuals 
          who never mattered a tinker’s damn”—but at the same time she sees it as 
          “a gentle sort of mist” that can “soften rough edges.” The poem dramatises 
          this interior dialogue as a debate between a man and a woman. It shows 
          the relations between the sexes under strain even amongst political allies. 
          Perhaps, using Mary Louise Roberts’ model, it suggests that an examination 
          of what are thought of as women’s tastes or sensibilities is a way of 
          thinking about the future—that because we cannot know the future, we come 
          to it, at any one time, via our obsessions. Hyde’s poem tackles the future 
          in a dialogue about how men and women should behave. The dialogue takes 
          place between two characters carefully placed in a material and social 
          context. We as readers measure what they say against their circumstances. 
          For instance, the man’s work takes him outside the house. Is the wife, 
          then, meant to live all day not only physically inside the ‘hot little 
          house’ but also mentally burning with anger for other oppressed people? 
          The wilderness is just across the road, it is somewhere to go when you 
          get some milk. It’s an escape more effective for her than the contemptuous 
          victory he imagines: “One day fat fools will call this cottage charming/ 
          And hold an auction for our chamber pot.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Most 
          critics have played down Robin Hyde’s socialism. Sandbrook argues that 
          she championed D’Arcy Cresswell’s idea of “a spiritual renaissance” as 
          opposed to “a firmer and juster materialism.” <i><sup><a name="note51"></a> 
          <a href="#end51">[51]</a></sup></i>Other critics have contrasted her description 
          of her involvement in the protest march that turned into riots in the 
          main streets of Auckland in 1932 (“I being more than a little pro-Bolshie 
          was with the crowd in Karangahape Road”) with her sceptical remark in 
          her autobiography that she rejects “the dictatorship of the commissariat 
          in favour of Shelley’s ‘Masque of Anarchy’.”<i><sup><a name="note52"></a> 
          <a href="#end52">[52]</a></sup></i> These critics of course have an accepted 
          tradition of thinking on their side—political commitment equals didacticism, 
          equals poor writing. On the other hand, one can see these different positions 
          dramatised in Hyde’s later work (in this poem and in the novels) as ongoing 
          dialogues in which the possibility of a just movement against injustice 
          is complicated—but not necessarily abandoned—by showing characters and 
          their gender positions. Her radicalism can also be observed in her impulse 
          to “get the bigger picture,” to document all discourses of her period. 
          And she documents the arguments marshalled by men and women against each 
          other, not to say simply that ideologies are wrong, but that human beings 
          reach for them as a response to social pressures and injustices.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          collage or montage technique puts her alongside other radical writers 
          in an international context.<i><sup><a name="note53"></a> <a href="#end53">[53]</a></sup></i> 
          If one must look explicitly at intentions here, there is corroborating 
          evidence of Hyde valuing multiplicity and dialogue in her comment about 
          the popularity of Social Credit being a manifestation of New Zealand “awakening 
          to internationalism” in response to the Depression: “A sudden access of 
          thought on the world’s tangled problems must necessarily lead to mistakes, 
          fallacies, petty Waterloos. . . but it should lead further.” <i><sup><a name="note54"></a> 
          <a href="#end54">[54]</a></sup></i> Hyde’s interest in different voices 
          and ideas is an interest in multiplicities of opinion as broadly representing 
          the world, documented in order to understand it better. Hyde was herself 
          involved in various political groups, including Douglas Social Credit, 
          and interested in the ideas and activities of friends who were communists.<span lang=EN-NZ style='font-size:12.0pt;

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          may be a more powerful way of reading this later work than a purely feminist 
          account. For instance I do not, as Michele Leggott does, see the wife’s 
          words at the end of the “Husband and Wife” as a solution, but rather as 
          part of the ongoing debate.<i><sup><a name="note56"></a> <a href="#end56">[56]</a></sup></i> 
          In <i>Dragon</i> <i>Rampant</i> Hyde comments: “Anyhow I have small use 
          for the female principle segregated from life. It could help and it won’t; 
          it knows nothing, except to be pitiable and bear children. For the rest 
          it is all talk.”<i><sup><a name="note57"></a> <a href="#end57">[57]</a></sup></i> 
          “Husband and Wife” puts both sides of the bafflement—the (self-denied) 
          male desire for tenderness and the (denied) frustration inherent in the 
          female immersion in nature. His insistence on brutal reality, and hers 
          on healing nature, add up to a painful conundrum of failed communication.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Instead 
          of seeing Hyde as a writer in a female tradition which aroused the ire 
          of her male contemporary writers (a narrowly literary historical interpretation), 
          one can alternatively see her work as an attempt to explore the complexities 
          of the period by addressing the relations between men and women in a new 
          way. For the women, the negotiation of relationships with likeminded men 
          was a way of formulating a new version of what it could mean to be female, 
          and a possible new future. But as the poem “Husband and Wife” shows, this 
          was by no means easy. Hyde’s need to make a living as a writer (having 
          no independent income) may have contributed to her keeping closely in 
          touch with all aspects of the pre-war period, since she was necessarily 
          writing for newspapers and mass-circulation periodicals and knew her audience. 
          Her particular ideal of female autonomy comes out of her time—the idea 
          of a woman with a baby and a job. This is an ideal that fell into disrepute 
          and disappeared in the 1950s and 1960s. Perhaps the Domestic Purposes 
          Benefit, which was introduced in the early 1970s, fits in with Hyde’s 
          hopes for the future, but now at the end of the century, when that benefit 
          is a subsistence income only and when politicians see social freedom as 
          the opportunity to participate in the market economy, we can see Hyde’s 
          picture of society as significant again. We should also see Hyde’s 1930s 
          type of feminism as socialist and concerned with formulating ways of thinking 
          about working-class women, Maori women, and the material situation of 
          individuals, unlike much second-wave feminism, which has been middle-class 
          and has focused on psychology and psychoanalysis.</font></p>

          as she felt it, and also the perception of her as being old-fashioned 
          and anti-avant garde. Seen in a less positivist historical perspective 
          her correspondence with John A. Lee, for instance, can be understood as 
          an opportunity for her to contemplate a development of a style sufficient 
          to her socialism, and his incitements to her to create “themes for poetry 
          that have the hot news value of 1936” as useful rather than hackneyed 
          (Letter 7 March 1936, Shadbolt, 17). Another relevant angle may be Fredric 
          Jameson’s contention about Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht and this 
          period: “... Brecht and Benjamin had not yet begun to feel the full force 
          and constriction of that stark alternative between a mass audience or 
          media culture, and a minority elite modernism in which our thinking about 
          aesthetics today is inevitably locked.” Afterword, <i>Aesthetics</i> <i>and</i> 
          <i>Politics,</i> Verso (London: New Left Books, 1977) 207.</span></font></p>
