        Sections from Robin Hyde's &#147;The Book of Nadath&#148;<br>
        </font></b><b>AU Fair Copy Manuscript (1937</b>)

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        wrote <i>The Book of Nadath</i> early in 1937 and revised it through the 
        year. She may have taken it to England in 1938 but it was not published 
        in her lifetime or in the posthumous collection of her poems in 1952. 
        It is the book of nothing (<i>nada</i>) and the book of everything, arguably 
        the crowning achievement of her poetry and a great “lost” poem of the 
        1930s. The four sections selected here represent the range and type of 
        Hyde’s lyrical social prophecy: the false prophet Nadath searches the 
        landscape and conscience of a time and place which is 1937 New Zealand 
        and Nietzschean (or Maori) all-time. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        fair copy manuscript is a complete version of the poem and was used to 
        supplement the damaged typescript that was the basis of first publication 
        in 1999 by Auckland University Press. The manuscript (AU 610) is held 
        by Auckland University Mss and Archives as part of the Iris Wilkinson 
        Papers 97/1. It consists of 88 leaves written on Exquisite and Ariel Bond 
        paper. The arrangement of the thirteen sections is not necessarily Hyde’s 
        after the eighth section, where consecutive page numbers give way to individually 
        numbered sections. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        garden, a garden and a garden : three spaces held between the seas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triple 
        as all things are triple, partaking of the nature of the body, the mind 
        and the spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which 
        are three, but one : and from which <s>all</s> men have echoed their creeds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        shall the violets lie in beds, in bays of dark blue, and the soft tide 
        of odours wash about her feet.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very 
        small is the sunbeam, very white : an almond, and she shall set it between 
        her lips.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        sunlight is wheat grain, and the doves fly down out of the tree of her 
        dreams : the tree Nadath has planted for her in her garden.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her 
        pavement is the rose : her wine is of the anemones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        I have set her sign in Heaven, the thin crescent moon, which holds the 
        ghost moon between its horns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the crescent moon today is all her light : silvery and fierce, but slender, 
        easily set aside or thwarted by the clouds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        when she has come into her own, the full moon will shine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        search out the dark places of this earth, the places that are full of 
        fear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Nadath is building a house, the house of woman : in the morning 
        he set out to build.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>In her father’s house she is a daughter : in her husband’s house 
        she is a wife: and at last in her son’s house she is his mother, who has 
        grown old.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And though he reverence her, yet is the ground she treads on not 
        her own. But where is the house, the house of woman?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Shake the bells over the little bride, the bride of seven : shake 
        out the bells and the curtains upon the wind, and carry her through the 
        streets in the gay palanquin, tasselled with crimson and silver.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Bear the wands of ivory before her, and grant her her hour, though 
        you curse her in your hearts, because she was born a daughter and not 
        a son.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>For after this day, she is wedded to custom, and to the sad inner 
        knowledge of women, and is no more her own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And her hands that were light and swift, become heavy, filled with 
        rebukes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Of a man it is said, He is a man. But of a woman they ask, Is she 
        such as will give pleasure and comfort to men?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>To her father, her lover, her husband or her son, to all such as 
        may ask of her?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And if not, she shall be left desolate. There is no place for her 
        in the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>In the east was the binding of feet, that she should not walk again. 
        But in the west was bound and holden more than her feet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even 
        her heart, her dignity and her grace lest she should move alone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Nadath went out in the morning and spoke to the swallows, that 
        were building their nests of twigs and clay. Their shuttle of blue came 
        and went, dissevering the air.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Give me a crumb of your masonry, and the little secret of your craft. 
        I go to build a house for woman, who has no house of her own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        the mother of swallows answered, I may not. It is all for the young, and 
        the nest is not of my own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Then Nadath went into the woods : and he saw the bark worn from 
        the trees where the stags had rubbed their antlers, and marked on the 
        earth the swerving trails of many little feet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And the sunlight let down white hair, like a woman that is alone, 
        and joys because of her aloneness. She lets down her hair, and walks gravely 
        on the moss, or suddenly dances with none to see her, or runs forth and 
        takes the sea between her two hands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And these are hers, her possessions. She loves them as the bower-bird 
        loves his bright berries,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Having been never the possessor, but always the possessed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Nadath found the squirrels, that were busy with nuts and acorns, 
        rolling them along the ground,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        said, Give me : and I will make a drinking vessel for the house of woman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>But the mother of squirrels said, I cannot. It is for the young 
        ones in winter.  And though I starve, still must the young ones feed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        on an island the seals lay basking, where the waves broke white and green, 
        and the dull sea fretted its sides softly against the rocks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And dived, and brought up fish. And Nadath said, Give. It is for 
        the table in the house of woman. She will be hungered, having come a long 
        way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>But the mother of seals said, I feed my children. And if there 
        is no milk in my paps, it is time I were dead and turned to bones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 
        Nadath went into the cities, and sought men, and said to them, Give. It 
        is for the house of woman, unbuilded as yet. But one day it shall be a 
        fair house, and you shall rejoice to be its guests.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        may even come that you win to safety therein.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>And the men of the cities laughed and answered Nadath, We have 
        given indeed. What beast has so fair a skin as woman?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> 
        </span>Have we not combed the jungle, and brought back the plumes of the 
        bird of paradise, the osprey and the aigret?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the white wastes where the fox is a hummock against the snow? The ermine, 
        the silver foxes, the little things taken in traps? Have we not clad her 
        in cruelty, and given also the orchid with its strange colours and an 
        odour as of sleep?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        the depths of the sea we sought dyes, and tore off the bark of trees for 
        crimson. We slew one another for opals, and robbed even the gods of their 
        emeralds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        sought a lotion that would make her tresses yellow, and a secret to keep 
        her breasts as burning snow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer 
        then, prophet who speaks for woman, what beast has so fair a skin?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nadath answered, 
        You have indeed given richly to your vanity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
        neither with the skins of trapped beats, with the purple feathers or the 
        jewels : neither with vair or with miniver shall you cover up that which 
        is left undone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        now I must go on my way. For I go to build the house of woman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        came to the women who worked in the houses and the fields, and said to 
        them, Will you give?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        shall be a fair house, and your own, and in it you may live.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is sanctuary also for the seekers of this world. For all who cry out, 
        and are unappeased.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        some said, We will give. But they had no heart for what they said, and 
        did not believe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 
        said, In my father, my husband and my son there is satisfaction for me, 
        and a place where I may lay my head.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        all who spoke looked beyond Nadath, seeking to watch the ways of men, 
        if they should come or go.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said to the women, Look. And against the skies was shown a vision, the 
        shape of a man who sought to climb a hill. But it was labour in vain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly 
        he climbed and heavily, and his eyes were the eyes of one bewildered. 
        And the body of a woman was hung about his neck. Her hands touched the 
        ground and her head fell back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        were pearls in her ears and about her throat, but her eyes <s>ar</s> and 
        her lips were senseless, vapid as if she slept.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, He climbs heavily, burdened with what he has slain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 
        perhaps that which is hung about his neck is neither dead nor sleeping, 
        but thinks, The man has willed it, It is better so, for I love the man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
        there is a crest to the hill and an ocean beyond the crest. Salt is on 
        the air there and the birds are white flakes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        no beauty is lost there, but runneth like a child in the woods : but runs 
        and cries, in the might of the abounding sea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunsets 
        burn and die there, like roses cast into a fire upon an altar. The dawn 
        rises again, and her hair of roses enwraps her feet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is a country of song, but the man may not come to it, because of the burden 
        hung about his neck.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither 
        may the woman meet him there, running among the birch trees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
        you may be satisfied, women of the houses and fields. For what beast has 
        so fair a skin?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        for you that are not fair, where is the equal of your obedience and devotion?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh 
        slaves, is it out of the loins of slaves that the new world can be born?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        now I may talk with you no more, for I go to build the house for woman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        Nadath was desolate in his secret heart, because none would give to the 
        house.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither 
        the birds not the beasts, neither man nor the woman herself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said to the evening sky, It is in vain. She has chosen as she wills, and 
        it may be she has chosen well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        is a dignity in defeat, and forgetfulness also. And if the world beyond 
        her womb grows loud and foul of mouth, a strutting braggart or by turn 
        a child that whimpers, what is that to her?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She 
        knows the child, but she does not know the man. But a voice spoke to Nadath 
        and said gently, The house is built.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        Nadath looked over a level stretch of waters, and saw the house of woman. 
        It was little and old, and its wooden walls were set down on the edge 
        of the sands. And the woman stood in her door.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the sands mounted above the yellow flowers and swept into her house, as 
        if they would bury it deep. There was the sand of forgetting about her 
        threshold. But as she stood she swept it out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her 
        eyes looked over the seas for a sail that would come. Sometimes the sand 
        mounted to her knees, sometimes it was a thin film, and Nadath saw her 
        bare feet. But the woman in her house was not afraid. Her lips smiled, 
        and Nadath said, The loneliness is gone out of the world. Fear is struck 
        dead at its heart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        olives and the cress, the irises, the lilies that go forth like angels 
        with trumpets, and the little flowers also, that browse in the grass like 
        goats,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        is planting them in her places : a garden, a garden and a garden, three 
        spaces set between the seas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        as for the house of woman, it is built. And one day she shall be called 
        the conqueror of the sands.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a name="weavers"></a>The 
        Weavers and the Dyers.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White 
        lay the toi-toi in the wind : the plumed spears were all at rest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        slow as smoke, across the evening drifting, the singing came : but faster 
        than a falling star, the dream behind the singing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        awoke and followed, and came to the place where they sat,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        weavers and the dyers, the old women who know the secrets : their withered 
        hands plied fast, and around them lay the fragments of a broken world, 
        a world that is gone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        water-gourds and the calabashes, the red ochre and the instruments of 
        carving, with the small bone flutes, and the greenstone, both inanga and 
        robe-of-the-sky.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
        were shards together in the moonlight : but before the heap, a young damsel 
        danced, her brown limbs slender and supple.  Nadath’s heart called the 
        damsel his sister.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And the 
        weavers and the dyers made their slow singing, as it were a sorrow upon 
        the place,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        rent veil of the ancient things that are past, and the things that are 
        still to come.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their 
        hands took the flax : and when it was bleached, and hung in narrow strips, 
        in fringes of flaxen beads, they dipped it in the dye-pots, and drew it 
        forth black, vermeil and white.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said to the old, What do you?  And they answered, We make her a dancing-skirt,  
        the young maiden of out race, who goes forth to dance before the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Her limbs are fair enough, Leave her be, without your custom and 
        your sorrows. But the weavers and the dyers said,  She shall wear it. 
        The vermeil for her pain, the black for her darkness, and the white for 
        her hour of vision.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Must it be? His heart was heavy for the damsel, for she was young.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        the weavers and the dyers said, Aue! we may not do otherwise,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        the white is not, except together with the black and the red. And they 
        hung the dancing skirt upon her limbs, and she danced no more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        took her by the hand, and said, Come, e hine. And they went to a place 
        of cliffs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where 
        the gannets lay, a great snowstorm of wings, and the sea beat below. The 
        sea was a pulse of darkness, and the beat of ancient things, that befell 
        here when the place was empty and new.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 
        the dancing-skirt was hung upon the damsel’s limbs : before the heart 
        of Nadath was a house where the shadows go out and in.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        large stars arose, cutting the black water with fins of fire.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Sing to me, e hine.  The heart of Nadath is heavy tonight, heavy 
        for the sake of thy race and mine also, because of the things that must 
        be so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        damsel, Nadath’s sister sang. Her voice floated out, and the white gulls 
        cried in their dreams.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She 
        sang the ancient song, “My brother is the brother of the seagulls.”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which is 
        sung when the spirit goes free : when there is no more fear or holding 
        back, no border to the magestic world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        tide rose large and heavy, brimming the vessel, and the birds cried sharply, 
        disturbed in their rest and driven against the rocks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said to the damsel, It is very little that we know, thou and I,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose 
        school was solitude : whose only beacon was the star over the mountain, 
        as was known to thy fathers when they steered from from a distant country 
        long ago, from the lost Hawaiiki.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        it is in my heart that some canoes perished, and their names were set 
        aside : as the wise forget all those who do not come to shore.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        it may be that we sit in such a canoe. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But two 
        things we know, e hine, that are not known except to the people who climb 
        the cliff by night</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        know how the birds cry, the seagulls and the terns, being driven against 
        the rocks by the weight of the forcing tide. We know their sharp vexed 
        voices,  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And we know 
        the silence that comes thereafter, when the tide runs out again in its 
        channels, and little stirs, but the diamond birds sleep as if frozen into 
        the moonlight, bevelled on the dark hands of the sea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the damsel sat by Nadath’s side, her chin cupped in her hands, her limbs 
        weary of the white, the black and the vermeil. Nadath heard her lips say, 
        “My brother is the brother of the seagulls.”</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a name="yellow"></a>The 
        Yellow Man.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        yellow man stood on a little height above the city, and in silence looked 
        down. His hands were sensitive and fine. He did not speak, but his thought 
        vibrated like the string of a harp. Below him the lights came out in the 
        milky haze. The lights were like lost angels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the world had changed since Nadath’s day, and the day of his young companions. 
        There had been a victory and a defeat, and after that the day of the poppy. 
        So now the yellow man stood upon the hill, looking down.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        was the master of what he saw : in so far as one dream can vanquish another, 
        which is not greatly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        it seemed to Nadath that many of his young companions, grown old now, 
        and the children born to them in times of war and oppression, and those 
        other children, the seed of the yellow men in the wombs of our sisters, 
        lived on in the city, which was to them but a ruin with an anthill built 
        above : and had learned to endure the yoke.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        was no more revolt among them, except the revolt of him who thinks in 
        his heart, “You are there, but you are as a shadow. I do not acknowledge 
        you.”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But the 
        flame had sunk low enough, and now the sifting ashes choked whoever would 
        walk among them : a fine dust on the air, too fine to be perceived.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the people of Nadath had changed much, and become a silent folk. They 
        spoke little to the yellow man, or when they spoke to him their tongue 
        was false. And when he had passed them by, they laughed : and the old 
        men spat where his shadow had fallen, but the young had too bare and desolate 
        a pride even for that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among 
        themselves they conversed in a secret language : but <s>the</s> when the 
        stranger came, they fell silent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 
        muttered, Now he comes among us with his talk of brotherhood, as if he 
        were the elder in the land.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        the yellow man does not understand : let him pry in the ruins, this much 
        we have kept, our secrets from his understanding.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        was great sickness among the people of Nadath, and quick dying : the children 
        perished : the broken doors opened easily, and let in death,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
        where the young mother lay on a ragged bed with her child.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        the people of Nadath would not come to the yellow man, or accept the medicines 
        at his hands, or hear him when he gave counsel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They said, 
        Is it for Abel to ask favours of Cain? But Abel was struck down by his 
        brother. Now let Cain find the burying-place, and dig deep through earth, 
        since his nostrils are uneasy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let 
        him learn, he who sleeps in a conquered land beds himself with a corpse 
        : which shall take its time to rot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the yellow men wrote many books about the people of Nadath. They painted 
        pictures, and went into savage places to find relics. They said among 
        themselves, It is good : it is the truth at last. But the people of Nadath 
        laughed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
        a low laughter and bitter, an echo in the countryside. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the yellow men sought to goad on the people of Nadath, that they should 
        work at their ancient crafts, and make their songs, as in the times unconquered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not 
        that these things were now of value in their world : yet to lose them 
        was as if a fair captive should cut off her hair and sear her eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        it was as if the hands of Nadath’s people suddenly were dull, with a cunning 
        dullness,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the voice had nothing to say. And if one of Nadath’s people walked in 
        the streets with the yellow men, his voice was loud and brittle with its 
        falseness, and his eyes were the eyes of a dead man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the women who bore them sons crept back to their own at last : they would 
        not stay for all the golden robes and the azalea trees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
        were secret, and desired their own tongue. They were a legend that faded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        heard the thought of the yellow man, he whose hands were slender, and 
        who stood alone on the hilltop. He said in his heart, “What curse has 
        fallen on me? For I have come to hate my race and my companions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We 
        are too loud in these streets; but beyond is an echo of a voice that was 
        beautiful, singing its death-rune in solitude to the stars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When 
        we go among the defeated, we are hypocrites, and we bring back only that 
        pretence which we deserve,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For 
        we love them not in their defeat : but only the shadow of their days without 
        challenge, only that greenstone shadow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Layer 
        upon layer the story is made, with a death at t its heart. And all that 
        we build here is new, but the land is very old.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With 
        white hair, a streaming hair of surf, a hair of starlight, and of snow 
        upon the mountains.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I 
        am left desolate in the wake of a world, and standing alone before the 
        closed door of another. For I cannot imagine beauty but in freedom, and 
        freedom is neither victories nor a banner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It 
        is the sacredness of the soil, the sacredness of an integrity left untouched,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which 
        dies when its air is polluted : which cannot live, without its living 
        water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        among my countrymen I stand alone : yet the dead thing at our heart poisons 
        us all, and accursed is the air we breathe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        cannot be ourselves, we cannot know ourselves, for shame at the watching 
        of the greenstone shadow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, So I remember it from the days of my youth, before a world was fallen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        was the burden of the conqueror, and the heavy price of an empire. Our 
        backs were young when we took it up, but old enough before we laid it 
        down in the shadow :           </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        for the reason of this, we learned to hate one another, and so fell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is strange how the plans of a few shall make water-carriers of the children, 
        ere yet their limbs are grown.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        if there be still in the world a place where the feet of the children 
        dance, let Time hang it with mists and with the snowy fleeces of the fir-trees, 
        and <s>the</s> put a cordon around it of young trees with raven locks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest 
        it be known, and an evil come to it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        the yellow man on the hilltop neither heard Nadath, nor saw him, no more 
        than the living behold the misty dead. He stretched out his delicate hands, 
        and they were empty. The weight of a world lay upon his wrists, but it 
        was not enough.</font></p>

        Far Flyers.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        was late in the year : the time of the shining cuckoo was past, when the 
        children,  hearing three notes of a call, run out among the trees, and 
        say “It is lucky to see the summer bird.” (For the blue-striped body is 
        seldom seen.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        flowering-time was gone of the seaward trees that burn red at Christmas, 
        and the bellbird drank an autumn honey from the withering flax.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter 
        was not yet, but the shadows of the first flames were cast about the walls 
        of houses, and the earth was lulled towards her sleep. Sometimes in the 
        skies the pale autumn lightnings were shown, without terror but with splendour, 
        like the face of a god without wrath.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old 
        people remembered the Maori names of the stars who guard the sleeping 
        crops, and saw to it that the kumara gods were set at the edges of the 
        fields, little gods of clay and stone,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest 
        she be too sullen, the earth in her white time and her black time, and 
        forget the whisper of the striving roots.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        a valley of the north, where the manuka grows down to the sand, and beyond 
        the sparse grasses is nothing but ocean, the wings of the far flyers made 
        ready : the godwits, who fly each autumn to Siberia. Day and night their 
        wings crest the sea, and it is written that they do not pause in the long 
        journey.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        in the spring they fly over the northern villages. a mighty cloud, and 
        come again to the country of Maui : and in the waning year they fly the 
        many thousand leagues, and find Siberia; and if there be people in those 
        wastes, it may be that the children of the Kulaks welcome them, and the 
        little villages that are lost ring the bell or beat tin drums because 
        they are visited.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        why they fly so far, every year hither and yonder across the ocean, that 
        is their secret, and is written in the book of the ancient things that 
        are not to be known. It is their destiny, and the light bones of the mother 
        chose it before the egg was hatched in the nest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        though their coming may be seen, a great cloud across the beaches, the 
        hour of their going is their own affair, and no man has watched their 
        flight, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless 
        it were someone old and solitary, who lived alone, and closed his heart 
        about what he saw, thinking, Fly on. I will not betray you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        watched them as they made ready. And sometimes, as if children were playing, 
        one of them strutted on the sands and threw out his voice, crying, Follow, 
        follow. And a group rose into the air, the wings beat fiercely. There 
        was tumult among the great host. But in a little while the claws were 
        on the sands again, making the starring trails, and the young leaders 
        averted their heads as they passed the camps of the elders.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        mothers screamed, but the very old were serene : as for their leader, 
        he was secret, none might come to him, know whom he should be, until the 
        hour,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
        the ancient knowledge of the blood, and that which bears up the hollow 
        bones of the wings, should come upon him, and the sea speak plainly : 
        then he should lead them without question or rebuke.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said to the far flyers, Shall I watch the going? But they answered, Is 
        not Nadath the prophet also a man?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No 
        man has seen, unless it were someone lost and old, whom we willed to encounter 
        miracle before he left this earth : it may be we have enclosed such a 
        one in our wings, and afterwards he enclosed us in his heart,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        the secret is not told.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Watch the 
        false starts, and the boastings of the young who circle in the air. When 
        the time comes we will depart, but we will not be seen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, The fringes of a sea-anemone are rose and blue, when they sway in 
        the rock-pool : but touch them, and the beauty is gone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 
        with the heart and its secrets, whether it be the heart of a man, or the 
        heart of a people with wings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        is nothing to fear from Nadath, far flyers : he is best pleased that the 
        heart should retain its mysteries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 
        speak a little of where you go, and what you do.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the godwits said, For the many dropped in the sea and broken upon the 
        journey there is the nest of jade, even the nest of death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        for the others, unless the land has fallen away, there is a nest of brown 
        in the north.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
        fly across strange wastes, but we are known to the villages that no man 
        from the world beyond shall ever know :</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 
        dwells there because they dwell there, even as we godwits fly because 
        we fly. It is their lot, and flying over we drop them a feather. We are 
        known to them by name, though they know little of the kings and the emperors. 
        Has Nadath the false prophet a word for these villages, that the godwits 
        may drop it when they drop the villages?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Tell them that there is a green ocean beyond the white, and the 
        spirit shall set out. There comes a time when they are no longer prisoners, 
        and the white shall melt.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        tell them this also, it is good to grow deep. Her minerals are not known 
        in the earth, nor the colours of flowers sought out, unless the root search.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        the heart and being of man is little understood, except by way of searching 
        in a winter twilight,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
        the mind is a lanthorn and sheds its beams : but the gazer, whose hands 
        are bitten by frost, suffers because the circle of light is so little, 
        and the walls of the snow are very great.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 
        against these ancient enemies, the snow and the darkness, shall emerge 
        the something called man : and because of him the race dies not, though 
        it seems to wither in the cities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
        that thinks himself the laggard, the dweller in the ice-bound places, 
        is mounted upon another barricade, and fends off time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The far 
        flyers said, Nadath speaks well, for a prophet who is false, and the feather 
        shall be dropped when we fly over. But what of the countries we shall 
        pass?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        is a saddle of silver, and it is a great mountain : there are silver reins, 
        and they are rivers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
        were ikons in the wooden churches, a time ago, and we saw the sleighs 
        outdistance the young wolves. There were heavy furs, and emeralds in the 
        head dresses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
        these have changed, and the old cities have changed their names for new, 
        and have the haggard faces of  a youth that dares much but has never yet 
        been cherished,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
        are a child born without nurse, and given suck at a breast of little wealth 
        : they have endured without a cry, and seek their own salvation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young 
        and gaunt and ready, they stand with the weapon in their hands : ready 
        to live, if it may be, or else to die hardly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
        take little thought today for the prophets, true or false, having a prophet 
        of their own, who is dead : but on his body their dreams must stand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        they do not watch the far flyers, being concerned to hold their own : 
        being concerned that the spare child shall grow to manhood.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under 
        Siberia lies the country of Russia : shall the far flyers drop a feather 
        there?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadath 
        said, Say this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No 
        man can hold the dream in his hands, and be equal to the dream, for more 
        than a little time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
        that, let him be what he will, let him protest and use many words, and 
        give service or evil to the people,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
        is no longer the man who dreamed the dream in his youth : and in time, 
        rest comes from the knowing of this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
        is only a little that any man can give of his best : for his best is not 
        his own, but vouchsafed, and taken again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        after this, he is the man alone, with the follies and weakness of a man 
        : no more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore 
        rejoice that our sons shall be impatient, and rise and overcome us. Rejoice 
        that they in turn shall dream the dream.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown 
        men who have tested the dream with steel and shod it in method, do not 
        weep. Remember that we still have the children.  Sacrifice heavily for 
        tomorrow : for alone in the world, you have tomorrow safe between your 
        hands. The nations live out their day, but you have tomorrow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
        if today be a cold one, a bitter day on the steppes and a threadbare in 
        the cities, with much complaint and much deceit, as thick as the leaves 
        on an autumn wind, yet it is not unworthy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        you the virtue is patience : it began with the shawled heads bowed before 
        the altars, with the humble chants, and with the people who called their 
        tyrant little father : it shall see your cities bow their heads before 
        the impatience of your youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        Russia it is very deep of root : deeper than the voices of assurance,

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fifth 
        section in AU Ms (36-[46]). Nadath’s mission to build the House of Woman 
        contains an echo of Nietzsche’s Zarathustra who says: “I love him who 
        laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for the Superman, 
        and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant”(Nietzsche  Prologue 4). 
        But ideologically Nadath more closely resembles the historical Zarathustra 
        (c. 630-550 BC) whose <i>Gathas</i> or divine songs refer to paradise 
        as the House of Songs and Praise where Ahura Mazda (Lord of Life and Wisdom) 
        dwells (Zarathustra Yasna 51:15).</font></p>

        can hold the dream    </i>See signed prose fragment, beginning: “A man 
        who travels with his dream travels with a dark torch”(AU  601). Nadath 
        addresses post-revolutionary Russia, obliquely acknowledging the difficulties 
        of Stalinism but not disillusioned with Communism. For Hyde, as for many 
        pre-war sympathisers in the West, Soviet industrialisation was still the 
        model of a rationally planned economy which might win the ultimate revolution 
        of a stateless, classless society. The costs outlined here stand in bitter 
        (though unintentional) contrast to those inflicted by the Great Purge 
        (<i>Yezhovshchina</i>) 1936-38 and the Siberian labour camps. Stalin’s 
        Russia is another face of the Iron Child but this was not yet certain 
        knowledge in the West. Hyde, who called herself variously a Socialist 
        and a Communist, wrote to John A. Lee (11/18 August 1937), protesting 
        the Labour government’s treatment of Maori at Orakei:</font></p>

        is one gospel in the world today which is consistent with an honest, slow-moving 
        but not monkish idealism, it is Socialism. I’d rather be shot with the

        of the August 1939 Soviet-Nazi Non-Aggression Pact was the determining 
        shock to Communist sympathisers in the West. The moment is famously defined 
        by another New Zealander, David Low, in a cartoon published 20 September 
        1939 in the London <i>Evening Standard</i>, in which Hitler greets Stalin 
        over the corpse of Poland saying: “The scum of the earth, I believe?” 
        to which Stalin responds: “The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?”</font></p>
