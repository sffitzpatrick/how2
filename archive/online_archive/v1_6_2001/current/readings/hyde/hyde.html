                February 1937 Hyde spent three weeks at Whangaroa Harbour in Northland, 
                living in a shack on Fish Factory Point and typing the final draft of 
                <i>The Godwits Fly</i>. It was a highly productive time. She also drafted 
                a number of poems which reflect her preoccupation with a dazzling, immanent 
                landscape and its inhabitants. Many of the poems, including the first 
                30 pages of <i>The Book of Nadath</i>, were written on pad paper watermarked 
                Exquisite Bond. Three poems (“Sand,” “The Last Ones” and “Descendants”) 
                were later typed and given to her psychiatrist, Dr G M Tothill. In this 
                section, the Exquisite drafts and fragments from Whangaroa, plus a number 
                of other poems that lead out into the writing of 1937, demonstrate Hyde’s 
                creative energies at a point of origin. Some of the material is discussed 
                in the introduction to <i>The Book of Nadath</i> (Auckland UP, 1999).</font></p>
