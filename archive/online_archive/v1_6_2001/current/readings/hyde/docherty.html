        PhD thesis “‘Do I speak well?’ A collection of letters by Robin Hyde 1927-1939” 
        (University of Auckland, 2000) began with the transcription and chronological 
        assemblage of four collections of letters written by Hyde to JHE Schroder, 
        JA Lee, W Downie Stewart and PA Lawlor, over the time of her writing life. 
        Robin Hyde was the pen-name (or in her words, “nom-de-guerre”) of New 
        Zealand writer Iris Wilkinson (1906-1939), and the four men with whom 
        she corresponded were “men of letters.” The text that emerged produces 
        questions about writing, autobiography and genre because the 166 letters 
        have become another kind of volume in Hyde’s strongly autobiographical 
        oeuvre. In their collected form the letters are also a multiply-addressed 
        enactment of Hyde’s writing practice over the twelve years of its duration.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        first part of the introduction, which I have adapted here, addresses issues 
        of self and other imaged in the letters. My objective was to locate Hyde 
        in a tradition of twentieth century women who wrote the Self into writing 
        with an awareness of the genre boundaries they were disturbing.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><i>Disclosure 
        at the Precipice</i>: Writing Letters</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Presented 
        as merged chronology with supporting continuity Hyde’s letters convey 
        the metanarrative of an unfixed narrator. Hyde writes each at a particular 
        time and place in her life and writing, resulting in two kinds of disclosure. 
        The first is quotidian information, functional and specific, that provides 
        chronology: addresses, dates, names, events described in the letter and 
        its physical details of ink, paper and watermarks. “Letters are the great 
        fixative of experience,” wrote Janet Malcolm sifting the biographies of 
        Sylvia Plath, “They are the fossils of feeling”(1994, 110). But this kind 
        of disclosure is not equivalent to historical truth. The rich quotidian 
        record and its cross-referencing in these four collections yields competing 
        versions. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
        is a second level of disclosure, the abyssal, “precipice” writing that 
        reveals desire and need, histrionics, theatricality and play. This is 
        the kind of writing from which quotation is routinely excerpted; Hyde’s 
        letters have been combed for such exhibits by researchers wishing to construct 
        her one way or another. At this level it becomes apparent that address 
        is not bound to the recipient so much as to the activity of writing itself.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
        fascination with the <i>cri de coeur</i> was perhaps most revealingly 
        in her correspondence with John Schroder. In August 1934 she wrote telling 
        him of a book with which she had become “a little bit obsessed”(JS75). 
        The book was <i>Folle-Farine</i> (1883) by Ouida, pen-name of the popular 
        novelist Marie Louise de Ramée.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
        The excerpt she quotes closes with the question, “Do I speak well Sartorian?”(JS75). 
        The same question, at once reflexive and rhetorical, hurled at self and 
        other, whispers beneath the text of Hyde’s letters. Sometimes it is a 
        plea, sometimes it seems ironic, and often it is produced in certain knowledge 
        that the address <i>is</i> on target so that it resounds at both the quotidian 
        and abyssal levels.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However, 
        the question does not actually appear in Ouida’s <i>Folle Farine.</i> 
        Hyde’s “quotation” is selected from different parts of the novel, and 
        includes her own flourishes:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Listen 
          Sartorian, I will speak. Indeed, I can make good speeches. I will drink 
          some wine—so—it is good. I will wear this handsome cloak and you shall 
          be my audience, yes? Now this is the most terrible death-cry of despair. 
          ‘J’avais quelque chose là.’ ‘I had something to give.’ For it is the 
          despair of the bodily life for the life of the mind that dies with it. 
          When a man clings to life because it is sweet and fair and good, for 
          life’s sake, there may be weakness in his shudder at its impending loss. 
          But when a man grows loth to lose life because it gives him power to 
          accomplish things greater than he, which yet without him must finish, 
          there is strength in him . . . L’artiste est un dieu tombé, qui se souvient 
          de temps quand il créa un monde. Call it madness, Sartorian, call it 
          folly, it is both. The ivory Zeus that was to give its sculptor immortality 
          lives but in tradition, the bronze Athene which was to guard the Piraeus 
          in eternal liberty has long been levelled with the dust. Yet with every 
          age the artist still gives life for fame, sanity for fame . . . Still 
          cries ‘Let my body perish but make my work immortal.’ Do I speak well 
          Sartorian? (JS75)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Folle-Farine, 
        (literally flour dust), illegitimate and cast out, works for her grandfather 
        the miller of Ypres as a kind of feudal slave. She was deposited on his 
        doorstep as a small child by a well-meaning gipsy protector after the 
        death of her mother who had eloped with her shiftless gipsy father. Folle-Farine 
        is hated by the local villagers who become convinced she is a witch. As 
        a lonely young woman she meets the starving, delirious artist Arslan, 
        also an outcast, and tends him back to health. Arslan lives for his art 
        and Folle-Farine’s love for him goes unrequited. Eventually she approaches 
        the Prince Sartorian, whose folly is art, hoping to interest him in Arslan’s 
        work. She is proud, pure and honest, and refuses Sartorian’s demand that 
        she give up her love for the artist in return for Sartorian’s assurance 
        that Arslan will be provided for. Folle-Farine refuses the bribe several 
        times, she and Arslan (separated) suffer terribly until she surrenders 
        and marries Sartorian. The novel ends with Folle-Farine’s long sought-for 
        meeting with Thanatos (Death), and his lament: “I am the only pity in 
        the world. And even I — to every mortal thing I come too early or too 
        late”(Ouida 1893, 802).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
        “quotation” conflates two parts of the novel in which the narrator evokes 
        the poverty of the artist and his bitterness and frustration at not being 
        able to work(Ouida 1893, 530, 582). Her question “Do I speak well?” addressed 
        to Sartorian, is an appendage which joins her own strong feelings to those 
        of the artist with whom she is in sympathy. Here she speaks in the role 
        of Folle-Farine to the power-broker Sartorian. Addressed to Schroder the 
        speech sounds like an affirmation of her (writing) voice. Hyde recited 
        a near identical “quotation” at the 1936 Authors’ Week (including the 
        interpolated question), in a speech titled “The Writer and His Audience” 
        (or as she joked to the crowd “Yourselves and Ourselves”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
        This time she followed the question with a closing quip:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I don’t, 
          myself, though Folle-Farine might have done if she had been here to 
          speak for herself. But I have tried to speak what I think is the truth, 
          and I thank you for your courtesy. (ACL NZMS 542, 11)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
        fascination with this text endured. In the Auckland University collection 
        of Hyde’s poetry manuscripts there is a prose fragment which begins “The 
        bronze Zeus...” and also includes the question “Do I speak well?”(AU 4c/490). 
        Further, in the Derek Challis Collection there is a short story (incomplete 
        and unsigned) titled “The Sacred Person of the Emperor” which incorporates 
        another variation of the <i>Folle-Farine</i> paragraph. There is another 
        two-page prose fragment which may in fact belong with the single page 
        in the Auckland University collection.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a> 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        words “J’avais quelquechose là,” I had something there, or in Hyde’s translation 
        “I had something to give”(JS75)<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> are repeated to Schroder, in this 
        and later letters. It is a cry for acknowledgment, an expression of the 
        desire for communication. As in the question “Do I speak well?” (my choice 
        of a title for the letters text) the words convey urgency, display and 
        a sense of the abyss into which they fall.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        this context Georges Bataille’s 1945 interpretation of Nietzschean communication 
        is useful:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The beyond 
          of my being is first of all nothingness. This is the absence I discern 
          in laceration and in painful feelings of lack: it reveals the presence 
          of another person. Such a presence, however, is fully disclosed only 
          when the <i>other</i> similarly leans over the edge of nothingness or 
          falls into it (dies). “Communication” only takes place between two people 
          who risk themselves, each lacerated and suspended, perched a top a common 
          nothingness. (Bataille 1992, 20-21)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
        often wrote at this precipice, and was aware of it. She was looking for 
        the other who would look into the abyss alongside her. There are three 
        surviving “precipice” letters to Schroder. They are the undated 1934 <i>Folle 
        Farine </i>letter quoted above (JS75); a letter of 14 February 1935 in 
        which she quotes Tagore: “I do not remember if you ever shamed me by looking 
        away when I bared to you my heart?”(JS77); and one of 27 December 1937 
        in which she confesses to a “carping half-hatred” of him.(JS96) [See end 
        of essay for excerpts.]</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        desire and struggle to communicate is intrinsic to Hyde’s compulsion to 
        write her life. Other letters in these collections include actual biographical 
        sketches written of necessity, variously revealing and concealing her 
        self. A long-embargoed letter to John A Lee of 23 October 1937 (JL21) 
        was written in response to a misunderstanding. A letter to Trevor Lund 
        of the <i>Southland Times</i> (8 October 1936) also responded to a sort 
        of misunderstanding. Hyde wrote yet another sketch (12 April 1935) at 
        poet Eileen Duggan’s request for biographical information to use in an 
        article about her. Each letter openly desires to “set the record straight,” 
        insisting on its authenticity. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><i>The 
        Wild Indecency of Selfhood: </i>Understanding Letters</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        three overtly autobiographical letters noted above are exceeded by the 
        letters’ collectively generated proliferation of biographical data which 
        maps the course of selfhood across and in time and place. Hyde is sometimes 
        deliberately false, often only uncertain. Each of the men will make a 
        claim to a particular knowledge of her, despite this occlusion. “Hyde 
        is about hiding, about surviving by hiding, and she stamps the exigency 
        as a personal signature in every part of her work”(Leggott 1995, 271). 
        She is <i>always</i> only this particular presentation of her self, Robin 
        Hyde (Iris Wilkinson) — hybrid one. But because she is repeatedly marking 
        the momentary, we must also consider the effect of this (so-called) repetition.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reading 
        this mass of moving particulars led me to Julia Kristeva’s 1984 essay 
        “My Memory’s Hyperbole,” in which she discusses the difficulties of bringing 
        the self to a piece of autobiographical (in this case, essay) writing. 
        She argues for the use of all resources of biography in the presentation 
        of the Self as fluid, temporal, incomplete and endlessly making itself 
        over.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The eruptions, 
          encounters, loves, passions, as well as the more or less liberated or 
          controlled eroticism that have shaped each person’s biography constitute 
          [. . .] the deepest influences of an individual path. In the essay I 
          simply present the visible surface effects. Only a diary, a novel perhaps 
          could restore the wild indecency of it. (Kristeva 1987, 234)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is this wild indecency of selfhood, its excessiveness, that I believe 
        is revealed by the presentation of Hyde’s letters amongst fragments of 
        autobiography. Hyde repeatedly rewrites her self; in the letters she writes 
        for nameable others, in the published works for a less specific audience 
        (Other), and in her 1935 Journal for those she calls her ghosts. The shift 
        in voice echoes these changes in proximity, the fluctuating distances 
        between self and other. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
        letter is as urgent or immediate as the date on which it is written. Kristeva 
        suggests a diary (defined in <i>SOED</i> as “lasting for one day”—why 
        not a letter?) as perhaps a place where eruptions can take place. Kristeva 
        legitimises the use of auto/biography in the literary field sixty years 
        after Robin Hyde, and following thirty years of her own and others’ feminist 
        theoretical writing. Hyde’s writing practice reveals a woman compelled 
        always to tell her story in writing. Excessive repetition of the wild 
        is wild. This is the force we encounter in the letters and the notional 
        (and un-bound) archive in which they lie.</font></p>

        Hyde in this way we move outside or across genre distinctions already 
        put under pressure in her writing. The letters in their chronological 
        sequence disclose the gaps and imponderables; notes and continuity acknowledge 
        that poems, fiction, journals, journalism and other letters are coincident 
        and open-ended. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As soon 
          as the word “genre” is sounded, as soon as it is heard, as soon as one 
          attempts to conceive it, a limit is drawn. And when a limit is established, 
          norms and interdictions are not far behind: “Do,” “Do not” says genre, 
          the word “genre,” the figure, the voice, or the law of genre. [. . .] 
          Thus, as soon as genre announces itself, one must respect a norm, one 
          must not cross a line of demarcation, one must not risk impunity, anomaly

      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        passage from Jacques Derrida implies a disobedience already detectable 
        in Hyde’s own refusal to fit genre specifications. Her writing is still 
        as resistant to a linear management of literature as it was in 1953 when 
        James Bertram’s review article “Robin Hyde: A Reassessment” appeared in 
        <i>Landfall</i>. Bertram began his essay with a biographical sketch which 
        reduces Hyde’s life to “a rather embarrassing record of dangerous living 
        and over-stretched ambition”(182). He followed this with notes on each 
        book of prose, where in every case he undermines praise with a series 
        of pejorative adjectives. By isolating Bertram’s pejoratives we can form 
        a reading of the works as Hyde’s effort at resisting the force of assimilation.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Journalese</i> 
        is “impressionistic.” <i>Passport to Hell</i> is “imaginative reporting” 
        in which the writing is “over-coloured and over-sensational.” <i>Check 
        to Your King</i>, despite its “zest” (or because of it) is “<i>tour de 
        force</i>, rather than pure creation.” The late Thirties brought “the 
        only two straight novels” Hyde wrote. It seems that the fact that they 
        come close to definition by Bertram condemns them to harsher criticism. 
        <i>Wednesday’s Children</i> is “an unsatisfactory book,” “uncertain,” 
        and “improbable.” “Much more straightforward” is <i>The Godwits Fly</i> 
        although the end is “cobbled up.” Bertram produces a reason for this novel’s 
        short-comings, that its writing was “interrupted.” Her final book, <i>Dragon 
        Rampant</i>, written with Bertram’s assistance in fact-checking, is “fragmentary 
        and chaotic, and not very easy to follow”(182-83).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        consistency of her failure to comply seems to indicate something deliberately 
        antagonistic to genre in Hyde’s work. Perceptions have changed sufficiently 
        since Bertram’s time of writing to accord value to this indeterminacy 
        that he neither recognises nor values. In a recent essay on the essay, 
        poet-critic Rachel Blau DuPlessis wrote of the restlessness in writing 
        not in, or for, a genre, but at “a moment of writing before the genre,” 
        at an “impacted point prior to the flying off of matter into planets, 
        fragments into texts, and over all [with] a sense of volatile incipience”(1996, 
        23). Hyde’s prose writing suggests such a level of excitement, the fragile 
        tension of writing on and to the edge. The letters also are written at 
        this proximity, and indeed DuPlessis notes a similar poetics of essay 
        and epistle, “obeying intuition’s agonising necessity”(25). Hyde’s voice 
        is insistent; repetitively and compulsively telling and turning the story. 
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bertram 
        underpins his criticism with a misreading of Hyde’s own uncertainty about 
        her work. He writes that “in clear-sighted moments at the end she had 
        few illusions about the quality of her published work”(1953, 183). The 
        following comments from her letters illustrate that her awareness of the 
        instability of her prose is coupled with the conviction that she is propelled 
        by necessity and authenticity.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
        need for an audience was documented by Lawlor in <i>Confessions of a Journalist 
        </i>(1935), to which she replied that “though the young woman hotly denies 
        always wanting an audience,” she will allow that she does “love to make 
        speeches”(PL 11). (She makes no comment on his claim that this “girl” 
        is a “genius,” 214.) If the books are written in some cases with a desire 
        to impart a certain knowledge or history (and accepting that all writing 
        seeks an audience), it is never the case that Hyde writes with a view 
        to complying with any generic expectation. What her peers and later critics 
        have lamented as a perceptible lack of control in the prose, is better 
        read as an indication of the reader’s discomfort in the face of Hyde’s 
        willingness to write the problem of writing. Murray Edmond has suggested 
        that in her poetry a “bumpy diction” read in her own time as “Georgian, 
        archaic, genteel, poeticised, excessive and hysterical,” can be read now 
        as “peculiarly satisfying to the baroque, fragmented sensibility of a 
        postmodern age”(2000, 116). This syncopated rhythm is perhaps a specifically 
        feminine response to the sound of her own voice (unfamiliar in the patriarchal 
        tradition). Hyde often seems to be astonished by her work. The word that 
        emerges idiomatically in this disquiet is <i>queer</i>.</font></p>

        knew that writing hinges on experience. Letters provide access to the 
        sliding of one moment into another. It is this movement that resists the 
        law of genre. I am tying together this resistance with a writing of self

        genealogy could be constructed to link Hyde’s work with other women’s 
        autobiographical genre-breaking productions. Parallels emerge in both 
        life and writing between Hyde and HD (1886-1961) transatlantic poet and 
        writer a generation older than Hyde. Each woman was the mother of a still-born 
        first child and an out-of-wedlock secondborn. HD’s palimpsests repeat 
        her biography in variations of concealment and revelation. Her writing 
        has been vigorously republished since the 1980s and is presented now as 
        “an escape from binary and hierarchical thinking associated with patriarchy. 
        The term [palimpsest] denotes a parchment that retains partially erased 
        parts of earlier writings, which strain productively with new text. [. 
        . .] HD can be credited with anticipating the maternal semiotic of Julia 
        Kristeva, and with giving a female voice to classical myths”(Scott 1995, 
        496). The maternal semiotic is an unsettling quality, a destabilization 
        of the text. Its presence endures and may be read back across cultures 
        and history. The value given to its performance will vary significantly 
        depending on the critical climate of a given era.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        1994 Bernadette Mayer published <i>The Desires of Mothers to Please Others 
        in Letters</i>. It is a work of textual dissent, particularly interesting 
        here because it is composed of letters written but not sent to various 
        addressees some twenty years before publication. The letters record a 
        period of domestic and creative life in which the crossing of narrative 
        threads between letters is a deliberate strategy for producing a non-linear 
        text. As in Lyn Hejinian’s <i>My Life</i> (1980, 1987) a formal structure 
        which has temporal implications (the years of a life; a sequence of letters) 
        refuses customary arrangements of genre. Mayer put these letters aside 
        before publishing them as a writing project, giving titles to the letters 
        in place of an address. She confounds the notion of letters as private 
        communication from the outset, and is useful here as one who is writing 
        and archiving letters without following the conventions of sending, retrieving 
        and assembling for later publication. The letters remain with Mayer like 
        any other manuscript. She is her own editor, testing and taking charge 
        of the writing then and now, and refusing the conventional production 
        of historical autography. Hejinian describes the letter-writing Bernadette 
        as “at any given point precisely and descriptively somewhere, and yet 
        she is also everywhere”(Mayer 1994, back cover).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My 
        presentation of Hyde’s letters in a feminist theoretical context they 
        seem to prefigure is also an attempt to address the problem of genre. 
        The text crosses Hyde’s writing: it is always there with the letters, 
        and yet also everywhere else Hyde was writing. This kind of generative 
        text, still finding out what it can be and what (like a letter) can be 
        added at its next issuing, finds a natural home in cyberspace. We <i>post</i> 
        to the internet, and the posting is updatable. Like DuPlessis, Alice Notley 
        advocates an inclusive excess in her work which is often published electronically 
        before, or in place of, hard copy. In her essay “The Poetics of Disobedience”(1998), 
        Notley writes from a position of “not believing, and telling the truth 
        as it comes up,” adding that “one must disobey everyone in order to see 
        at all.” Hyde, writing her 1934 Autobiography (a diary commission to which 
        she assigned chapter titles so that it already conflates therapeutic and 
        literary production) understood the audacity of reversing authority’s 
        gaze. “I discovered for myself, this afternoon, a scientific <s>fact</s> 
        truth. It’s this. All facts are, as all men ought to be, equal in the 
        sight of Me”(chapter 18). </font></p>

        letters text is not a different kind of selected letters, and not a form 
        of biography. Genres support the classification of end products. In a 
        selected letters, an editor cuts out repetitions excessive to the requirements 
        of narrative progress. This text exceeds narrative and exposes the monolinear 
        fiction of “autobiography” or “selected letters.” Its function is to show 
        excess, repetition, neurosis and brilliance in context. What remains is 
        the writing of a life, and the life of writing. It is an invitation to 
        tra(ns)verse writing. It is only the clue.</font></p>

          I am grateful to Alison Jeffreys, who is currently writing an MA thesis 
          at Auckland on Hyde’s short stories, for pointing out connections between 
          the short stories and <i>Folle-Farine. </i>The motif of the “Red Mouse 
          of Brocken” occurs often in Ouida’s novel and is also the title of a 
          Hyde story (mentioned to Schroder Mar 1935, JS78). The single page fragment 
          at Auckland (AU 490) is not clearly numbered and could be read as 5 
          or 3.</font></p>

          In her 1990 doctoral thesis Susan Ash describes a similarly pejorative 
          reading of Hyde by Frank Birbalsingh in <i>Landfall</i> 124 (Dec 1977). 
          His comments “indicate a fundamental lack of understanding of Hyde’s 
          method” (45).</font></p>
