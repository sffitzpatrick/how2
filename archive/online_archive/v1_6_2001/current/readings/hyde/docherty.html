          PhD thesis “‘Do I speak well?’ A collection of letters by Robin Hyde 1927-1939” 
          (University of Auckland, 2000) began with the transcription and chronological 
          assemblage of four collections of letters written by Hyde to JHE Schroder, 
          JA Lee, W Downie Stewart and PA Lawlor, over the time of her writing life. 
          Robin Hyde was the pen-name (or in her words, “nom-de-guerre”) of New 
          Zealand writer Iris Wilkinson (1906-1939), and the four men with whom 
          she corresponded were “men of letters.” The text that emerged produces 
          questions about writing, autobiography and genre because the 166 letters 
          have become another kind of volume in Hyde’s strongly autobiographical 
          oeuvre. In their collected form the letters are also a multiply-addressed 
          enactment of Hyde’s writing practice over the twelve years of its duration.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          first part of the introduction, which I have adapted here, addresses issues 
          of self and other imaged in the letters. My objective was to locate Hyde 
          in a tradition of twentieth century women who wrote the Self into writing 
          with an awareness of the genre boundaries they were disturbing.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><i>Disclosure 
          at the Precipice</i>: Writing Letters</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Presented 
          as merged chronology with supporting continuity Hyde’s letters convey 
          the metanarrative of an unfixed narrator. Hyde writes each at a particular 
          time and place in her life and writing, resulting in two kinds of disclosure. 
          The first is quotidian information, functional and specific, that provides 
          chronology: addresses, dates, names, events described in the letter and 
          its physical details of ink, paper and watermarks. “Letters are the great 
          fixative of experience,” wrote Janet Malcolm sifting the biographies of 
          Sylvia Plath, “They are the fossils of feeling”(1994, 110). But this kind 
          of disclosure is not equivalent to historical truth. The rich quotidian 
          record and its cross-referencing in these four collections yields competing 
          versions. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          is a second level of disclosure, the abyssal, “precipice” writing that 
          reveals desire and need, histrionics, theatricality and play. This is 
          the kind of writing from which quotation is routinely excerpted; Hyde’s 
          letters have been combed for such exhibits by researchers wishing to construct 
          her one way or another. At this level it becomes apparent that address 
          is not bound to the recipient so much as to the activity of writing itself.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          fascination with the <i>cri de coeur</i> was perhaps most revealingly 
          in her correspondence with John Schroder. In August 1934 she wrote telling 
          him of a book with which she had become “a little bit obsessed”(JS75). 
          The book was <i>Folle-Farine</i> (1883) by Ouida, pen-name of the popular 
          novelist Marie Louise de Ramée.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
          The excerpt she quotes closes with the question, “Do I speak well Sartorian?”(JS75). 
          The same question, at once reflexive and rhetorical, hurled at self and 
          other, whispers beneath the text of Hyde’s letters. Sometimes it is a 
          plea, sometimes it seems ironic, and often it is produced in certain knowledge 
          that the address <i>is</i> on target so that it resounds at both the quotidian 
          and abyssal levels.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However, 
          the question does not actually appear in Ouida’s <i>Folle Farine.</i> 
          Hyde’s “quotation” is selected from different parts of the novel, and 
          includes her own flourishes:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Listen 
            Sartorian, I will speak. Indeed, I can make good speeches. I will drink 
            some wine—so—it is good. I will wear this handsome cloak and you shall 
            be my audience, yes? Now this is the most terrible death-cry of despair. 
            ‘J’avais quelque chose là.’ ‘I had something to give.’ For it is the 
            despair of the bodily life for the life of the mind that dies with it. 
            When a man clings to life because it is sweet and fair and good, for 
            life’s sake, there may be weakness in his shudder at its impending loss. 
            But when a man grows loth to lose life because it gives him power to 
            accomplish things greater than he, which yet without him must finish, 
            there is strength in him . . . L’artiste est un dieu tombé, qui se souvient 
            de temps quand il créa un monde. Call it madness, Sartorian, call it 
            folly, it is both. The ivory Zeus that was to give its sculptor immortality 
            lives but in tradition, the bronze Athene which was to guard the Piraeus 
            in eternal liberty has long been levelled with the dust. Yet with every 
            age the artist still gives life for fame, sanity for fame . . . Still 
            cries ‘Let my body perish but make my work immortal.’ Do I speak well 
            Sartorian? (JS75)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Folle-Farine, 
          (literally flour dust), illegitimate and cast out, works for her grandfather 
          the miller of Ypres as a kind of feudal slave. She was deposited on his 
          doorstep as a small child by a well-meaning gipsy protector after the 
          death of her mother who had eloped with her shiftless gipsy father. Folle-Farine 
          is hated by the local villagers who become convinced she is a witch. As 
          a lonely young woman she meets the starving, delirious artist Arslan, 
          also an outcast, and tends him back to health. Arslan lives for his art 
          and Folle-Farine’s love for him goes unrequited. Eventually she approaches 
          the Prince Sartorian, whose folly is art, hoping to interest him in Arslan’s 
          work. She is proud, pure and honest, and refuses Sartorian’s demand that 
          she give up her love for the artist in return for Sartorian’s assurance 
          that Arslan will be provided for. Folle-Farine refuses the bribe several 
          times, she and Arslan (separated) suffer terribly until she surrenders 
          and marries Sartorian. The novel ends with Folle-Farine’s long sought-for 
          meeting with Thanatos (Death), and his lament: “I am the only pity in 
          the world. And even I — to every mortal thing I come too early or too 
          late”(Ouida 1893, 802).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          “quotation” conflates two parts of the novel in which the narrator evokes 
          the poverty of the artist and his bitterness and frustration at not being 
          able to work(Ouida 1893, 530, 582). Her question “Do I speak well?” addressed 
          to Sartorian, is an appendage which joins her own strong feelings to those 
          of the artist with whom she is in sympathy. Here she speaks in the role 
          of Folle-Farine to the power-broker Sartorian. Addressed to Schroder the 
          speech sounds like an affirmation of her (writing) voice. Hyde recited 
          a near identical “quotation” at the 1936 Authors’ Week (including the 
          interpolated question), in a speech titled “The Writer and His Audience” 
          (or as she joked to the crowd “Yourselves and Ourselves”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
          This time she followed the question with a closing quip:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I don’t, 
            myself, though Folle-Farine might have done if she had been here to 
            speak for herself. But I have tried to speak what I think is the truth, 
            and I thank you for your courtesy. (ACL NZMS 542, 11)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          fascination with this text endured. In the Auckland University collection 
          of Hyde’s poetry manuscripts there is a prose fragment which begins “The 
          bronze Zeus...” and also includes the question “Do I speak well?”(AU 4c/490). 
          Further, in the Derek Challis Collection there is a short story (incomplete 
          and unsigned) titled “The Sacred Person of the Emperor” which incorporates 
          another variation of the <i>Folle-Farine</i> paragraph. There is another 
          two-page prose fragment which may in fact belong with the single page 
          in the Auckland University collection.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The

  name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> are repeated to Schroder, in this 
          and later letters. It is a cry for acknowledgment, an expression of the 
          desire for communication. As in the question “Do I speak well?” (my choice 
          of a title for the letters text) the words convey urgency, display and 
          a sense of the abyss into which they fall.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          this context Georges Bataille’s 1945 interpretation of Nietzschean communication 
          is useful:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The beyond 
            of my being is first of all nothingness. This is the absence I discern 
            in laceration and in painful feelings of lack: it reveals the presence 
            of another person. Such a presence, however, is fully disclosed only 
            when the <i>other</i> similarly leans over the edge of nothingness or 
            falls into it (dies). “Communication” only takes place between two people 
            who risk themselves, each lacerated and suspended, perched a top a common 
            nothingness. (Bataille 1992, 20-21)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          often wrote at this precipice, and was aware of it. She was looking for 
          the other who would look into the abyss alongside her. There are three 
          surviving “precipice” letters to Schroder. They are the undated 1934 <i>Folle 
          Farine </i>letter quoted above (JS75); a letter of 14 February 1935 in 
          which she quotes Tagore: “I do not remember if you ever shamed me by looking 
          away when I bared to you my heart?”(JS77); and one of 27 December 1937 
          in which she confesses to a “carping half-hatred” of him.(JS96) [See end 
          of essay for excerpts.]</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          desire and struggle to communicate is intrinsic to Hyde’s compulsion to 
          write her life. Other letters in these collections include actual biographical 
          sketches written of necessity, variously revealing and concealing her 
          self. A long-embargoed letter to John A Lee of 23 October 1937 (JL21) 
          was written in response to a misunderstanding. A letter to Trevor Lund 
          of the <i>Southland Times</i> (8 October 1936) also responded to a sort 
          of misunderstanding. Hyde wrote yet another sketch (12 April 1935) at 
          poet Eileen Duggan’s request for biographical information to use in an 
          article about her. Each letter openly desires to “set the record straight,” 
          insisting on its authenticity. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><i>The 
          Wild Indecency of Selfhood: </i>Understanding Letters</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          three overtly autobiographical letters noted above are exceeded by the 
          letters’ collectively generated proliferation of biographical data which 
          maps the course of selfhood across and in time and place. Hyde is sometimes 
          deliberately false, often only uncertain. Each of the men will make a 
          claim to a particular knowledge of her, despite this occlusion. “Hyde 
          is about hiding, about surviving by hiding, and she stamps the exigency 
          as a personal signature in every part of her work”(Leggott 1995, 271). 
          She is <i>always</i> only this particular presentation of her self, Robin 
          Hyde (Iris Wilkinson) — hybrid one. But because she is repeatedly marking 
          the momentary, we must also consider the effect of this (so-called) repetition.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reading 
          this mass of moving particulars led me to Julia Kristeva’s 1984 essay 
          “My Memory’s Hyperbole,” in which she discusses the difficulties of bringing 
          the self to a piece of autobiographical (in this case, essay) writing. 
          She argues for the use of all resources of biography in the presentation 
          of the Self as fluid, temporal, incomplete and endlessly making itself 
          over.</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The eruptions, 
            encounters, loves, passions, as well as the more or less liberated or 
            controlled eroticism that have shaped each person’s biography constitute 
            [. . .] the deepest influences of an individual path. In the essay I 
            simply present the visible surface effects. Only a diary, a novel perhaps 
            could restore the wild indecency of it. (Kristeva 1987, 234)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is this wild indecency of selfhood, its excessiveness, that I believe 
          is revealed by the presentation of Hyde’s letters amongst fragments of 
          autobiography. Hyde repeatedly rewrites her self; in the letters she writes 
          for nameable others, in the published works for a less specific audience 
          (Other), and in her 1935 Journal for those she calls her ghosts. The shift 
          in voice echoes these changes in proximity, the fluctuating distances 
          between self and other. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          letter is as urgent or immediate as the date on which it is written. Kristeva 
          suggests a diary (defined in <i>SOED</i> as “lasting for one day”—why 
          not a letter?) as perhaps a place where eruptions can take place. Kristeva 
          legitimises the use of auto/biography in the literary field sixty years 
          after Robin Hyde, and following thirty years of her own and others’ feminist 
          theoretical writing. Hyde’s writing practice reveals a woman compelled 
          always to tell her story in writing. Excessive repetition of the wild 
          is wild. This is the force we encounter in the letters and the notional 
          (and un-bound) archive in which they lie.</font></p>

          Hyde in this way we move outside or across genre distinctions already 
          put under pressure in her writing. The letters in their chronological 
          sequence disclose the gaps and imponderables; notes and continuity acknowledge 
          that poems, fiction, journals, journalism and other letters are coincident 
          and open-ended. </font></p>

            norms and interdictions are not far behind: “Do,” “Do not” says genre, 
            the word “genre,” the figure, the voice, or the law of genre. [. . .] 
            Thus, as soon as genre announces itself, one must respect a norm, one

          passage from Jacques Derrida implies a disobedience already detectable 
          in Hyde’s own refusal to fit genre specifications. Her writing is still 
          as resistant to a linear management of literature as it was in 1953 when 
          James Bertram’s review article “Robin Hyde: A Reassessment” appeared in 
          <i>Landfall</i>. Bertram began his essay with a biographical sketch which 
          reduces Hyde’s life to “a rather embarrassing record of dangerous living 
          and over-stretched ambition”(182). He followed this with notes on each 
          book of prose, where in every case he undermines praise with a series 
          of pejorative adjectives. By isolating Bertram’s pejoratives we can form 
          a reading of the works as Hyde’s effort at resisting the force of assimilation.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>

          is “impressionistic.” <i>Passport to Hell</i> is “imaginative reporting” 
          in which the writing is “over-coloured and over-sensational.” <i>Check 
          to Your King</i>, despite its “zest” (or because of it) is “<i>tour de 
          force</i>, rather than pure creation.” The late Thirties brought “the 
          only two straight novels” Hyde wrote. It seems that the fact that they 
          come close to definition by Bertram condemns them to harsher criticism. 
          <i>Wednesday’s Children</i> is “an unsatisfactory book,” “uncertain,” 
          and “improbable.” “Much more straightforward” is <i>The Godwits Fly</i> 
          although the end is “cobbled up.” Bertram produces a reason for this novel’s 
          short-comings, that its writing was “interrupted.” Her final book, <i>Dragon 
          Rampant</i>, written with Bertram’s assistance in fact-checking, is “fragmentary 
          and chaotic, and not very easy to follow”(182-83).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          consistency of her failure to comply seems to indicate something deliberately 
          antagonistic to genre in Hyde’s work. Perceptions have changed sufficiently 
          since Bertram’s time of writing to accord value to this indeterminacy 
          that he neither recognises nor values. In a recent essay on the essay, 
          poet-critic Rachel Blau DuPlessis wrote of the restlessness in writing 
          not in, or for, a genre, but at “a moment of writing before the genre,” 
          at an “impacted point prior to the flying off of matter into planets, 
          fragments into texts, and over all [with] a sense of volatile incipience”(1996, 
          23). Hyde’s prose writing suggests such a level of excitement, the fragile 
          tension of writing on and to the edge. The letters also are written at 
          this proximity, and indeed DuPlessis notes a similar poetics of essay

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde’s 
          need for an audience was documented by Lawlor in <i>Confessions of a Journalist 
          </i>(1935), to which she replied that “though the young woman hotly denies 
          always wanting an audience,” she will allow that she does “love to make 
          speeches”(PL 11). (She makes no comment on his claim that this “girl” 
          is a “genius,” 214.) If the books are written in some cases with a desire 
          to impart a certain knowledge or history (and accepting that all writing 
          seeks an audience), it is never the case that Hyde writes with a view 
          to complying with any generic expectation. What her peers and later critics 
          have lamented as a perceptible lack of control in the prose, is better 
          read as an indication of the reader’s discomfort in the face of Hyde’s 
          willingness to write the problem of writing. Murray Edmond has suggested 
          that in her poetry a “bumpy diction” read in her own time as “Georgian, 
          archaic, genteel, poeticised, excessive and hysterical,” can be read now 
          as “peculiarly satisfying to the baroque, fragmented sensibility of a 
          postmodern age”(2000, 116). This syncopated rhythm is perhaps a specifically 
          feminine response to the sound of her own voice (unfamiliar in the patriarchal 
          tradition). Hyde often seems to be astonished by her work. The word that 
          emerges idiomatically in this disquiet is <i>queer</i>.</font></p>

          life and writing between Hyde and HD (1886-1961) transatlantic poet and 
          writer a generation older than Hyde. Each woman was the mother of a still-born 
          first child and an out-of-wedlock secondborn. HD’s palimpsests repeat 
          her biography in variations of concealment and revelation. Her writing 
          has been vigorously republished since the 1980s and is presented now as 
          “an escape from binary and hierarchical thinking associated with patriarchy. 
          The term [palimpsest] denotes a parchment that retains partially erased 
          parts of earlier writings, which strain productively with new text. [. 
          . .] HD can be credited with anticipating the maternal semiotic of Julia 
          Kristeva, and with giving a female voice to classical myths”(Scott 1995, 
          496). The maternal semiotic is an unsettling quality, a destabilization 
          of the text. Its presence endures and may be read back across cultures 
          and history. The value given to its performance will vary significantly 
          depending on the critical climate of a given era.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          1994 Bernadette Mayer published <i>The Desires of Mothers to Please Others 
          in Letters</i>. It is a work of textual dissent, particularly interesting 
          here because it is composed of letters written but not sent to various 
          addressees some twenty years before publication. The letters record a 
          period of domestic and creative life in which the crossing of narrative 
          threads between letters is a deliberate strategy for producing a non-linear 
          text. As in Lyn Hejinian’s <i>My Life</i> (1980, 1987) a formal structure 
          which has temporal implications (the years of a life; a sequence of letters) 
          refuses customary arrangements of genre. Mayer put these letters aside 
          before publishing them as a writing project, giving titles to the letters 
          in place of an address. She confounds the notion of letters as private 
          communication from the outset, and is useful here as one who is writing 
          and archiving letters without following the conventions of sending, retrieving 
          and assembling for later publication. The letters remain with Mayer like 
          any other manuscript. She is her own editor, testing and taking charge 
          of the writing then and now, and refusing the conventional production 
          of historical autography. Hejinian describes the letter-writing Bernadette 
          as “at any given point precisely and descriptively somewhere, and yet 
          she is also everywhere”(Mayer 1994, back cover).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My 
          presentation of Hyde’s letters in a feminist theoretical context they 
          seem to prefigure is also an attempt to address the problem of genre. 
          The text crosses Hyde’s writing: it is always there with the letters, 
          and yet also everywhere else Hyde was writing. This kind of generative 
          text, still finding out what it can be and what (like a letter) can be 
          added at its next issuing, finds a natural home in cyberspace. We <i>post</i> 
          to the internet, and the posting is updatable. Like DuPlessis, Alice Notley 
          advocates an inclusive excess in her work which is often published electronically 
          before, or in place of, hard copy. In her essay “The Poetics of Disobedience”(1998), 
          Notley writes from a position of “not believing, and telling the truth 
          as it comes up,” adding that “one must disobey everyone in order to see 
          at all.” Hyde, writing her 1934 Autobiography (a diary commission to which 
          she assigned chapter titles so that it already conflates therapeutic and 
          literary production) understood the audacity of reversing authority’s 
          gaze. “I discovered for myself, this afternoon, a scientific <s>fact</s> 
          truth. It’s this. All facts are, as all men ought to be, equal in the 
          sight of Me”(chapter 18). </font></p>

          letters text is not a different kind of selected letters, and not a form 
          of biography. Genres support the classification of end products. In a 
          selected letters, an editor cuts out repetitions excessive to the requirements 
          of narrative progress. This text exceeds narrative and exposes the monolinear 
          fiction of “autobiography” or “selected letters.” Its function is to show 
          excess, repetition, neurosis and brilliance in context. What remains is 
          the writing of a life, and the life of writing. It is an invitation to 
          tra(ns)verse writing. It is only the clue.</font></p>

            I am grateful to Alison Jeffreys, who is currently writing an MA thesis 
            at Auckland on Hyde’s short stories, for pointing out connections between 
            the short stories and <i>Folle-Farine. </i>The motif of the “Red Mouse 
            of Brocken” occurs often in Ouida’s novel and is also the title of a 
            Hyde story (mentioned to Schroder Mar 1935, JS78). The single page fragment 
            at Auckland (AU 490) is not clearly numbered and could be read as 5 
            or 3.</font></p>

            In her 1990 doctoral thesis Susan Ash describes a similarly pejorative 
            reading of Hyde by Frank Birbalsingh in <i>Landfall</i> 124 (Dec 1977). 
            His comments “indicate a fundamental lack of understanding of Hyde’s
