        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
          Gillian Boddy in 1991 quotes Pat Lawlor in 1935 quoting Jessie Mackay 
          several years previously on the subject of her younger contemporaries 
          Eileen Duggan and Robin Hyde, the voice on the wind seems impossibly distant. 
          To ground Mackay’s statement and its original context is one search among 
          many that might alter the sense we presently have of all three writers 
          as peripheral to the founding of a canon of New Zealand poetry. Jessie 
          Mackay—poet, journalist and critic herself—also announced in 1930 that 
          Eileen Duggan had written poems “to lay up in heart’s lavender for ever.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" ><span>[2]</span></a> 
          Somewhere between the desire for foundation (public, communal, conditional) 
          and the individual, partisan act of preservation lies the story of what 
          happened to women poets and their work as literary codes were altered 
          just before mid-century by a cultural nationalism inimical to previous 
          competences. </font></p>

          finished his 1935 cameo of Robin Hyde with a flourish of affectionate 
          territorial droit (the book was <i>Confessions of a Journalist</i>, published 
          a year after Hyde’s <i>Journalese</i>). Like Mackay, Lawlor was pinpointing 
          a hope poetry had for its constitution in the 1930s that sounds odd now. 
          We did forget. Or rather, the forgetting was carefully arranged and now 
          seems like natural consequence, an outworn mode giving way to newer forces. 
          But ghosts rise, and that word genius may still draw the fire Lawlor intended 
          for it. “[T]he girl” was in 1935 a single woman of twenty-nine, author 
          of one published prose work, two collections of poetry and a substantial 
          body of journalism. She had also had two children, two breakdowns and 
          two years’ residence in an extramural ward of the mental hospital in Avondale—the 
          same institution that claimed Eve Langley in the 1940s and Janet Frame 
          in the 1950s. What price genius in such contexts?</font></p>

          is a lost matrix of women poets whose presence in our literature needs 
          urgent reappraisal. How it was lost, and why, are absorbing questions; 
          but more important still is the matter and nature of matrix, with its 
          suggestions of support, nurture, and numerousness. Jessie Mackay (1864-1938), 
          Eileen Duggan (1894-1972), and Robin Hyde (1906-1939) were prominent figures 
          in an earlier version of generational descent in New Zealand poetry, and 
          they were conscious of the role. They knew and corresponded with each 
          other and with the literary editors of the day who promoted and published 
          them—notably John Schroder, Alan Mulgan, Charles Marris, and Pat Lawlor. 
          They were vigorous reviewers and they were eloquent in their support of 
          a wide range of causes that had in common a compassion for the outcast, 
          dispossessed, or disempowered. Rights for women and children, the temperance 
          movement, reform of discriminatory legislation against Maori, the loyalist 
          cause in Spain, Scottish and Irish Home Rule, or unemployment problems 
          closer to home were variously part of their brief. As unmarried, educated 
          women supporting themselves in part—or wholly in Hyde’s case—by journalism, 
          they were culture workers who believed also in a code of social service. 
          Blanche Edith Baughan (1870-1958) and Mary Ursula Bethell (1874-1945) 
          span the generational gap after Mackay and before Duggan and Hyde, and 
          suddenly we are looking at a capacity for shaping New Zealand poetry in 
          the first half of the century as a politically alert, humanitarian enterprise, 
          diverse in its subjects and styles but run on sympathetic and highly reticulated 
          energies that took as their point of departure the socially progressive 
          atmosphere of the late colonial period.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" ><span>[5]</span></a> 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          women made deliberate choices about what they wrote and who it was aimed 
          at. Their poems became well-known to readers also interested in the emergence 
          (their patronage assisted it) of local literature and in its links with 
          British tradition. The same readers could admire Hardy, Housman, Yeats 
          or de la Mare, and find similar emotional engagement and stylistic clarity 
          in the work of Duggan, Hyde and the others. They were not populists though 
          they shared pubishing venues (mostly newspapers) with popular verse, for 
          which there was a flourishing audience. In December 1935 Whitcombes had 
          in stock 750 copies of <i>The Perfume Vendor</i> by seventeen-year-old 
          Gloria Rawlinson. Hyde liked the poems and had written an introduction 
          to her friend’s book, but she was dismayed to find that only a dozen copies 
          of <i>The Conquerors </i>had been ordered by the same bookshop.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" ><span>[6]</span></a> 
          However, Duggan’s readership in the 1930s was large—second editions of 
          her <i>Poems</i> (1937) were printed in England and America—and Hyde’s 
          audience was certainly bigger than the 1935 anecdote implies.<a
  href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" ><span>[7]</span></a> Both poets were capable of 
          the kinds of simplicity that earned them casual readers as well as those 
          who took their work more thoughtfully.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
          such distinctions are at best arbitrary in the face of the powerful effect 
          their poetry had on individuals in its contemporary audience. I am fascinated 
          by the trace of a recurrent story which has it that the poems of Duggan 
          and Hyde were carried to the 1939-45 war by the fathers, uncles, brothers 
          or friends of those who also remember that such poems were often recited 
          from memory and/or that the book is still about at home somewhere. Physical, 
          literal distances the poems travelled, the memory of how and why they 
          travelled signals a most interesting kind of endurance: passionate and 
          totemic. </font></p>

          can mention democracy and magic in the same breath, sensing strategic 
          wisdom leaping through its beholders as a set of fiery transmissions. 
          Her scholarship is consequently tactical, blended with consciousness of 
          a vocation almost in the tradition of the Catholic teaching orders, and 
          (like that tradition) astoundingly reflexive. Who is Maro of Toulouse 
          in the title of the poem where Duggan carves up Modernist predilections 
          for obscurantism not long after excusing herself from Allen Curnow’s 1951 
          Caxton anthology? Who is L’Écrivisse Mère of her typescript poem, saying:

          am working in the dark, trying to bridge the distance between their tradition 
          and my standpoint, convinced these women have something to say that I 
          need to hear. I am moving by a kind of textual infra-red, looking for 
          places that make light of historical distance or heat up connections to 
          the present. Already we are leaving exposition for the condition of poetry, 
          its partiality, its ability to leap the abysses it opens. “Ah not as plains 
          that spread into us slowly,” Duggan wrote, “But as that mountain flinging 
          at the skies / And not as merchantmen which trundle in the offing / But 
          as a privateer that boards a prize, / Let song come always at me and not 
          to me.” The title of her poem pointedly conflates beauty with “Booty” 
          so that its final lines realise the inherent structural pun: “For beauty 
          like heaven by violence is taken / And the violent shall bear it away”.<a href="#_edn11"

          all prose-writers. Who does it for poetry before Hyde with her multiple 
          strategies of concealment? Hyde is about hiding, about surviving by hiding, 
          and she stamps the exigency as a personal signature in every part of her 
          work. It starts with the deliberate androgyny of the assumed name but 
          it travels also through endless references in her poems to rainbows, prisms, 
          bridges and arcs. The rainbow is the sign of Iris, she who connects heaven 
          and earth; Iris Wilkinson elaborated the clue of her given name, producing 
          an exquisite tension between presence and concealment of herself in her 
          work. There are iris flowers throughout her writing, and extensive play 
          with the optics of eye and I. Her own eyes, Gloria Rawlinson tells us,

          doubleness, and the whiff of urgent reasons for the adoption of strategy 
          should alert us to the scope and passion Hyde brings to the poetry of 
          the 1930s. She is prolific, speedy in her execution, with a journalist’s 
          pragmatism and (“my burning birds”) the conviction of a soul on fire. 
          The combination is electrifying, its risks obvious. By 1935, poised between 
          the worlds of convalescence (literally asylum) and literary career (the 
          run of novels and poetry 1936-39), Hyde is already underground, a combat 
          figure speaking under cover of poetic norms designed to retain rather 
          than alienate readers. This is important. She saves her direct assaults 
          on social, economic, and intellectual repression for newspapers and journals; 
          places of first consequence in the cut and thrust of daily reading. Poetry, 
          which she privileged above her other writing, shelters other, older ways 
          of registering violence and beauty in its perceptors—and yet Hyde stands 
          apart from the flagellation of self and others developed by her male contemporaries 
          as authoritative poetic expression.</font></p>

          did not like chopped-back austerities of style, and she was suspicious 
          of restricted agendas. She did not like the elevation of realism to high 
          moral and cultural ground, and most of all she disliked the scapegoating 
          of feminine consciousness which accompanied the installation of these 
          values in a national literature. Assessing the local scene in 1936, she 
          wrote: “Among the male poets of Auckland...there is a general dislike 
          of the sentimental, a trepidation in the use of imagination, a tendency 
          to believe that beauty is pretty-pretty...to regard the lyric mode as 
          a weak sister in poetry”.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" ><span>[18]</span></a> 
          Propagandist, she called the similarity of the individualists in their 
          longing for economic and social change expressed as insistence on a social 
          realist poetic (“it is intellectual suicide to determine on one mood and 
          one intention as the be-all and end-all of poetry”). Male poets, though 
          anti-feminist and destructive or partial in their criticism, are given 
          credit for their literary achievement—and disingenuously reminded of its 
          tainted heritage: “‘Well, I'm damned,’ I thought, “Of all the dear little 
          buttercups to come across just when least expected. Listen to this...’” 
          Her target here is Mason’s “O Fons Bandusiae”; Fairburn, Curnow, and Beaglehole 
          also come under scrutiny, <i>Phoenix </i>poets emerged from their early-1930s 
          association at Auckland University College.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          was fighting a number of interconnected battles, most of them deriving 
          from a generalised historical antipathy to women, behind which lay determinable 
          fears of female sexuality. Antipodean puritanism and its efficient polarisation 
          of gender had produced local variations on an ancient figure of the woman 
          in chains. Hyde’s titles—<i>The Desolate Star</i>, <i>The Conquerors</i>, 
          <i>Persephone in Winter</i>—signal her awareness of continuing struggle 
          against oppression; the poems spell out details: “I am The Silenced. From 
          my ageless dumb / Affronted calm, the last commands shall come.”<a href="#_edn19"
  name="_ednref19" ><span>[19]</span></a> Archetype for Hyde is folded with political 
          protest; specifically female oppression is lodged within the rhetoric 
          of Romanticism, so that to speak for women is to speak to other prisoners 
          in the compound. When Hyde’s dialogue poem “Husband and Wife” was published 
          in <i>A Caxton Miscellany </i>(1937) the imprint and the company it kept—Glover, 
          Fairburn, Curnow and others—foregrounded contemporary particulars of an 
          old battle:</font></p>

          sustained a series of flank attacks by her literary male contemporaries, 
          who had also diagnosed cultural malaise but (jealous of the attention 
          shown to her? anxious about their own market share?) were quick to label 
          her hysterical, over-productive, formally outmoded, and part of a journo-literary 
          mafia.<a href="#_edn21"
  name="_ednref21" ><span>[21]</span></a> Later, in ascendancy, they extended circumscribed 
          approval to her poetry. Even sympathetic criticism of Hyde still reports 
          from an orthodoxy that feared difference as lack or loss of control leading 
          to hybridity, “unevenness” and emotional excess in the work. Nothing is 
          easier to drop from a history than its compromised elements; there is 
          no room for the faintly praised when a crush of newcomers puts systems 
          of representation </font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hyde 
          understood what was happening. As fast as a generation of young men wrote 
          spiritual poverty into the colonial condition, she read there a dangerous 
          transference of guilt by association onto the female body. Leaving the 
          country in 1938, she could do the regulation nationalist/contemplative 
          poem (narrow-eyed, hard-edged, bloodstained) almost to the point of parody:</font></p>
        <blockquote>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which 
          fits the story of a new land as an alien, hostile presence, female and 
          other, to be “broken” in; the disquieting image of rape lingers in the 
          dripping of blood between fingers. But Hyde’s view of the relationship 
          between settler and land can be quite different. She belongs to a tradition 
          of poets part of whose stock in trade is hope of cultural continuity—even 
          (especially?) as they measure their own distances over time and space 
          from its sources. Hyde, Duggan, Mackay, Baughan and Bethell all conserve 
          and transmit a humanistic warmth (“old shoes of custom and courage”) determined 
          by their practical commitments to social justice. It is this blend of 
          the pragmatic and the idealistic that makes them seem curiously engaged 
          (if not at home) here decades before the carefully anatomised alienation 
          of the male poets wears off and allows them a measure of grace.<a
  href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" ><span>[23]</span></a> These women are not the 
          strident battleaxes or witless lady singers of popular parody. They do 
          not ignore the problems of the ground or the paradoxes of homing, but 
          their optimism and their perseverance can be a welcome respite from the 
          gloomy young flagellants who made a point of confusing their idealism 
          with prattle and sentimentality.<a href="#_edn24"
  name="_ednref24" ><span>[24]</span></a> A poem like Hyde’s “The Pioneers,” where 
          a delayed revelation of gender as well as of the thanksgiving form are 
          key factors, hardly counts as positivist naïvety, given its place in the 
          range of her construction of femininity. And yet that homage to female 
          forebears and its basis in handed-down stories is lost (along with Baughan's 
          narrative poem “Early Days”; or “The Paddock,” her verse drama for three 
          female voices) in a rumble of well-anthologised poems by men about the 
          terror of a land of inaudible stories and unspeakable difference.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" ><span>[25]</span></a>

          travelling in the southern lakes and mountains, up the Whanganui river,

          in Wellington (she hitch-hiked there in the summer of 1933-34, after finishing 
          her degree) Locke was editor of the communist <i>Working Woman </i>and 
          its successor <i>Woman To-day</i>; she knew Hyde through her contributions 
          to both papers.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28"

          writes many poems engaged with the business of community. They speak to 
          excess, there are too many of them, too many attempts to arrive at a community 
          of words. By contrast, Modernist poetics were about schism, separation 
          and fragmentation, with vocabularies of hardness and sharpness unmediated 
          by softness except as something to be repressed or sacrificed. Knives 
          on throats, axes on trees, breaking and clearing—the prescribed dramas 
          here were of transgression and punishment, the legacy of Modernism’s union 
          with the unresolved puritan factor. The result for women’s voices was 
          a poetry from hell, in which you were either a handmaiden (acquiescent, 
          diminished) or a sacrifice (obdurate, dead). Hyde’s early recognition 
          of mortal peril for women and women who were writers, and her attempts 
          to draw attention to the ways in which women were being excluded from 
          the new map of literary representation being drawn up in the second half 
          of the 1930s, are the public, articulate face of what women writers said 
          in the margins or not at all for a long time after 1939.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" ><span>[29]</span></a> 
          After 1939 the fight was lost along with Hyde’s life and the intervention 
          of the second war. What remains to us are the poems and their codings, 
          plus the orientations of Hyde’s essay journalism, letters and autobiographical 
          prose. A selection of that journalism is currently in print; the poems, 
          letters and autobiographical material are out of print or still in manuscript. 
          Why are we so slow to read the poet who most disrupts the orthodoxy set

          wrote to Glover two days before leaving New Zealand—ten pages by turns 
          taunting and elaborately good-humoured. She had already dealt with Glover’s 
          lampooning of women poets by writing a detailed compendium for the <i>Mirror</i> 
          called “New Zealand Authoresses”(see note 29). There, as in the letter, 
          her sense of enemy terrain is quite accurate, and she is at pains to distance 
          herself from Glover’s Caxton which did indeed gather to itself the anthology 
          project she foresaw in 1938.</font></p>

          other than those of clenched jaw and gritted teeth, and this despite her 
          often desperate personal circumstances. It has been customary to read 
          the poems written between October 1936 and August 1939 as “mature” work, 
          evidence that Hyde turned to New Zealand subjects with the realisation 
          that here was her true theme and a reason to reject the mythological elements 
          and romantic historicism of earlier poems. To privilege later work because 
          of a break with earlier style and subjects does disservice to the perspective 
          supplied by Hyde’s fascination with poetic tradition. It also neglects 
          the importance of archetype in her exorcisms of some persistent private 
          ghosts. Glover unwittingly fingers just such territory in <i>The Conquerors 
          </i>when he identifies “Outcast,” “The Forsaken,” “The Fugitive,” “The 
          Traitor,” “Home,” and “Escape” as well-worn “poetical” subjects.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" ><span>[31]</span></a> 
          For Hyde, the old world is built in as iconographic inheritance, its violent, 
          beautiful paradoxes intact to the last, its languages especially resonant 
          in the post-colonial psyche because so much of the conversation is about 
          the complications of endurance. Hyde learned how to write here because 
          of what she wrote about there, thinking through connections, transports, 
          overlays, and slippage; finding ways to light up the distance between 
          one tradition and herself, incipiently another. The conundrums of freedom 
          and captivity haunt her:</font></p>

          packed the typescripts of “Houses by the Sea,” to go on refining them

          is a poem of the 1920s doing service in the 1930s to the acknowledged 
          difficulties of making art live in a settler culture. Another poem, “New 
          Zealand Art,” first published in New York in the late 1920s, explores 
          the same problem, looping through a quest metaphor balanced on an unsettling 
          relationship between plural subject and singular comparison:</font></p>

          One of them is practically a co-text: “Do you think that wheat is like

          “Bread is to-day and to-morrow, / And all the yesterdays wild; / As old 
          as the first clay oven, / As young as a newborn child”). A woman longing

          surviving 1943 correspondence between Duggan and Curnow over her representation 
          in the 1945 Caxton anthology does not get as far as discussing which poems 
          Curnow wanted to print. Duggan’s biographer Grace Burgess indicates that 
          Duggan was quick to turn down the initial requests because she was unsympathetic 
          to the project and to its editor.<a
  href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" ><span>[48]</span></a> John Weir records evidence

          More serious negotiations over quantity and selection occurred 1956-1960 
          as Curnow prepared <i>The Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse</i>. Duggan 
          and Curnow/Penguin Books (London) reached the point of a legally negotiated 
          demand that she see proofs of the Penguin Introduction after withdrawing 
          her poems from the book. Page proofs were supplied in June 1960, and Duggan 
          was (with reservations) prepared to accept the Introduction as it subsequently 
          appeared, and to drop further action against the book’s publication.<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" ><span>[50]</span></a> 
          The four-year duel and its forty-odd pieces of associated correspondence

          removed. A thorn in the flesh. How did it happen? Two years previously 
          in June 1958, and with galley proofs of the anthology in hand, Curnow 
          had informed Duggan that her selection had been reduced to four poems. 
          Three of these (including “Twilight”) were not in the original six cleared 
          in 1956 as a consequence of John Reid’s intervention after Duggan had 
          initially declined to enter. Duggan was clear about her position and Curnow’s 
          selection: “one I had particularly asked him <i>not </i>to include and 
          the others were changed to two lyrics of three or four verses for which 
          he had no consent at all. I had not agreed to their inclusion nor do I 
          wish to be judged by my slightest rather than my best.”<a href="#_edn52"
  name="_ednref52" ><span>[52]</span></a> Editorial prerogative and contributor’s 
          rights promptly collided head-on. Duggan withdrew her work in July 1958, 
          then in September called in Colin Patterson, the lawyer who began negotiating 
          her possible re-entry into the anthology, represented by the six poems 
          agreed on in 1956. More importantly, after the experience of Curnow’s 
          1945 remarks and the recent contretemps over consents, Duggan seems to 
          have been looking for fair dealing in the Penguin Introduction — whether 
          or not her poems appeared in the book. Colin Patterson, later prominent 
          in commercial law and first head of the Securities Commission, was aware 
          of Curnow’s desire to have the poems if at all possible, and in effect 
          used ongoing negotiations over their appearance to first see and then 
          secure some control over what Curnow planned to say about Duggan's work 
          in his introductory essay.<a href="#_edn53"
  name="_ednref53" ><span>[53]</span></a> When the poems were finally excluded (November 
          1958), the fact that Patterson found Curnow’s criticism of her defamatory 
          kept proceedings open. Penguin was reluctant to publish while the threat 
          of a lawsuit hung over the book; the offending paragraph of the Introduction 
          was eventually removed altogether and not until 12 July 1960, after she 
          had seen the final version, did Duggan withdraw her complaint.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Around 
          June 1958, when Duggan first learned of her reduced selection, Alistair 
          Campbell, James K. Baxter and Louis Johnson had managed get hold of a 
          set of galley proofs, and were all three threatening to withdraw their 
          selections from the Penguin.<a
  href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" ><span>[54]</span></a> They stayed in, but Duggan 
          fought Curnow to a standstill over issues of representation that for a 
          moment in the late 1950s united older and younger generations in an interesting 
          if uncoordinated pincer movement against what each perceived as an unwelcome 
          prescriptiveness in the Caxton–Penguin line. Between them they delayed 
          the Penguin’s appearance two years. </font></p>

          issued <i>More Poems </i>in 1951. The unassuming title can be read at

          Poems </i>(1951)—aimed at those who wished its author would in her exclusion

          Sea </i>from Caxton, who had also published Mary Ursula Bethell's posthumous

          by Mary Stanley (1919-1980) entitled <i>Starveling Year</i>. Its arrival 
          completed a pattern of oppositional pegs dug into the terrain by women 
          poets (and their women editors) at the beginning of the inhospitable 1950s.

          pearl, undersea, lodged (by the desire of the poem for a rhyme) in the 
          shell where it was produced, records disturbance beyond the standard transformations 
          of grit by beauty. It is intact in the flesh (not spoken of) which made 
          it, and the long fretting of nacre and mucous membrane waits under the 
          surface of the pearl’s appeal as ornament or inlay. Duggan was looking 
          for a simile for mute feminine sorrow; the languages of the poem oversupplied 
          her with a through-road into the psychosexuality of female experience. 
          Perhaps the overload (and the reason the poem remained in typescript) 
          was perceived by Duggan as a literary offence, a straining after effect—but 
          it is precisely in that strain and the roughnesses it produces that other 
          stories begin to break through. The pearl, one step off clitoral (or foetal) 
          analogy, and the “third mouth, pink as coral” or the blue tide of smooth 
          canticles are all part of the offshore where women establish for themselves 
          languages adequate to the task of calling out consciousness of that condition 
          and possible colloquy with others. Duggan measured out the enormity of 
          the undertaking: “I have made throats of thoughts and dreamed they sang. 
          / So the court fool might leave his little stool, / To creep into the 
          empty daÏsed throne, / Dreaming his motley into cloth of gold.”<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58"
  ><span>[58]</span></a> By this measure a singing woman—gold-wet, with rainbow 
          eyes—looks with scant regard for chronology at Iris Wilkinson dreaming 
          the embrace of hills covered in gleaming wet gorse flower. The same poetic 
          delights in rhyming “wild” with “child,” “word” with “bird,” and regularly 
          juxtaposes “woman” with “human.” Duggan’s dreaming fool wakes to laughter 
          in court and finds “the air afleer with lights, / Himself still fool in 
          jerkin, cap, and bells.”</font></p>

          lover (Harry Sweetman dead in England in 1925 without Iris Wilkinson’s 
          knowledge) or the address of son to mother in the impossible grievous 
          out-of-time space where life did not proceed. Hyde knew the play intimately: 
          “All but four [poems of <i>The Conquerors</i>] were written here [at the 
          Grey Lodge], when I was blind and mute and deaf with illness—didn’t care

          false housewife Fortune shall break her wheel, / Provok’d by my offence”(IV.xv. 
          43-45). At one remove, almost the last, Hyde could write: “Sometimes fighting
