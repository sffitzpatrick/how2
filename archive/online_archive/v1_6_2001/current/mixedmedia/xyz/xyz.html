          is no such thing as “distance” as we know it. Distance, measured in visual 
          terms, is a halfway point between the physical and the purely, for lack 
          of a better word, “immaterial” realm. When someone becomes distant, she 
          goes to another “location” and to do so she figuratively or literally 
          becomes smaller to an observer who remains behind.</font> 
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
          our physical material plane, extreme manifestations are named distance 
          and they exist in a perceptibly continuous space. However, the immaterial 
          plane, which intersects with the physical, is made up of what is termed 
          discontinuous space.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Let 
          us say you are at point a with one friend and you want to visit another 
          friend at point b, which lies at the extreme end of this wide, elongated 
          valley. A valley so vast all of Manhattan could fit inside it. You proceed 
          in the following manner: First, you believe that Friend B exists at point 
          b, though neither Friend B nor point b is visible from where you stand. 
          However, you do have a direct line of sight to point b, and, if your eyesight 
          were refined enough you could indeed “see” Friend B using your physical 
          eyes. What you do is say good-bye to Friend A and move toward where you 
          believe point b to be located, following a theoretical line. Friend A, 
          unmoving, watches you leave, watches you literally become smaller to his 
          eyes. At some point, we will call it x, you disappear to him altogether, 
          which means he forgets you. At some point, call it y — which may or may 
          not be the same as point x — you suddenly “appear” in the smallest discernible 
          size to Friend B and become larger for him until you stand before him 
          in actual size. This means he truly “sees” you for the first time.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          is agreed that a person can change from one location to another by willing 
          it, much as she can make the muscles of her arm move by willing them to. 
          The muscles of the arm often move without conscious participation, as 
          when you find your arm abruptly lifting off a heated coil or in the midst 
          of an obscene gesture you had no intention to make. Let us postulate that 
          you can will yourself to another location and that it can be accomplished 
          in more than one way.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
          few in our material world are born with the ability to will themselves 
          to another location without engaging the body. During such travel, the 
          physical body remains fixed while a mind conglomerate travels to another 
          location. In examining accounts, it seems verifiable that emotions themselves 
          perform as fuel. The extraordinary thing about this mode of travel is 
          that even without the organs of sense — which have been left behind with 
          the body — the traveler is said to “sense” heat and cold, to “see” certain 
          details, to “hear” what is being said by people she observes, even to 
          experience the “touch” of another. I have personally experienced this 
          and will subsequently relate the details.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the immaterial world, the total you does in fact get smaller, but no energy 
          is consumed in the process. In fact, energy is released to the environment, 
          increasing in inverse proportion to size. People on the plane of mind 
          experience each other intensely in the moment, but there is no “distance,” 
          per se. Allow me to explain. The visual sense remains intact, but it is 
          as if the entire body has become the eyes — comparable to the sensate 
          acuity of the membrane of a cell. Immaterially, a person can exist in 
          two locations at once, and the body’s receptivity is heightened by an 
          increase in ubeity, even though the body in each location is diminished 
          in size.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Travel 
          does not exist on the immaterial plane. Rather we speak of the ability 
          to manifest at different locations. This means, theoretically, that one 
          could exist at an infinite number of locations and size would be infinitely 
          small at each. You may ask, are entities actually shrinking when they 
          manifest at a number of locations. The answer is yes they are. That’s 
          how the physics of the immaterial works. However, such shrinking creates 
          an influx of energy — energy is specifically increased by multiple manifestations. 
          That is the law.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Physically, 
          human beings are holotrophs, obtaining energy for movement and growth 
          by engulfing or swallowing living matter. It is true in both states — 
          the physical and the immaterial — that living entities are never the same 
          from moment to moment. However, living systems collectively comprise the 
          most permanent and stable form of matter in the universe. On the immaterial 
          plane — which as I said is intimately connected to the physical — there 
          are no true objects, no things, only willing entities. One being can inhabit 
          the same space as another; in fact, two or more often merge in a concentric 
          arrangement, infusing but never consuming one another. They are called 
          “concentrics.” To any one the whole constellation might be more or less 
          present simultaneously. Following is an attempt to describe how it works:</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
          any entity’s perception — remember that for any one others can exist inside 
          it — there is a point at once central which contains less than nothing. 
          There are spheres of infinite dimension. Other spheres, not infinite, 
          are so indistinct they barely persist. Those are the revulsors, the “isolates,” 
          our greatest enemies and oftentimes our dearest loved ones. The ones who 
          for various reasons won’t give you the time of day. When creatures do 
          not maintain an entirely equal attraction for one another, they may still 
          continue to exist in a coincident field. In such cases, there is no way 
          to determine, empirically, if other entities are extremely small, or if 
          one’s self has become exceedingly large. Are other beings part of you 
          or are you a part of them? Algebra cannot solve this dilemma.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
          the physical plane, entities not oneself seem predictably smaller than 
          oneself in terms of value. Physically, the entire universe seems to be 
          outside oneself at any time. Is it because the self perceives space as 
          something into which the body is born, through which it moves, metabolizes, 
          reproduces, and dies? There is no limit to space. Space is truly discontinuous. 
          Yet to experience the physical as infinite and discontinuous constitutes 
          a supreme mastery of mind.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
          the immaterial plane, the entire universe exists within ones own energy 
          membrane. Why then, on the immaterial plane, do entities sometimes become 
          smaller as they do with physical distance? Is it because you no longer 
          need them or no longer feel them a necessary part of your life?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Going 
          somewhere means that you no longer think about the person or place you 
          wish to leave but you think instead with more frequency and duration about 
          another person or another location. This is simply a physical description 
          of a change of heart: a straight line being the shortest distance between 
          two points but not so easy to obtain in real life. Some say emotions or 
          feelings are not subject to geometry and its laws. I believe they are.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Desire 
          itself contraindicates truth, such that in order to get what she needs 
          she does not always say what she means. The human sensory apparatus has 
          built and makes use of the tool of geometry for moving about physically. 
          However, geometry has no material basis. Geometry exists within the realm 
          of abstract thought, which is how it intercepts and informs the sensate 
          life.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How, 
          on any scale, could each and every being be inside each and every other 
          being. A sphere with an infinite number of points equidistant from all 
          others is the theory behind the fact that people carry around inside their 
          souls every person they have ever loved, as well as those they have hated. 
          Death makes no difference. Those loved or hated ones may carry around 
          inside their minds the lover or the hater, or they may carry around an 
          entirely different set of individuals, or no one at all. It has been said 
          that people exist who can hold all others alive in their minds, even ones 
          with whom they have never had direct contact. This may be what is meant 
          by samadhi or “enlightenment,” not a depletion or an emptying but an active 
          encompassing.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          about the people who have no others inside themselves?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They 
          are simply at an extreme location.</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
          they want to be...</font></p>
