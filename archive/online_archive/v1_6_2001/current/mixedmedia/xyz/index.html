          is a half-hour audio composition designed to be heard from beginning to 
          end at one sitting. The spoken text is a logical statement of the illogical 
          nature of truth. Presented in four sections with a coda, the musical structuring 
          of the words is broadly derived from North Indian Raga in that a principal 
          musician (the voice of Robert Ashley) is at first followed and then met 
          by a second musician (the voice of Joan La Barbara) and later other musicians/voices/sounds 
          join in and at times overwhelm them. Ideally, a sustained mood of openness 
          is invoked that gently colors the mind. The two principals engage in dialectic 
          opposing the physical world to the immaterial. They are also talking about 
          the difficulties inherent in human relationships.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
          the seemingly disembodied “distance professors” have achieved a kind of 
          stasis, we are catapulted into the middle of an after-lecture party where 
          some of the same ideas are put forward in a new way by a quartet of men 
          and women flirting and laughing as they try to make sense of things.</font></p>

          scientist says: “It’s a critique of theoretical science using physical

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          musician says: “It’s a raga. The principal musician begins. Is joined 
          by an acolyte, who with her great skill threatens to supercede him. Then 
          a host of other musicians joins in, but a kind of balance is achieved 
          in the end…”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          sensualist adds: “Yes, and after that chaos ensues: It’s a party of revellers 
          who have been bitten by the lecture (of the ‘distance professors’) and 
          they try to digest it as they flirt their way back to earth.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          visual artist says: “The recurring whistle was suggested by a Japanese 
          deer chaser, which is a sound that occurs when water fills a trough and 
          spills at intervals -- in this case once per minute. It occurs infrequently 
          enough that when it comes around again it is always a surprise.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          lover says: “It’s about the difficulty of being confined in a single human 
          body. All our problems begin here. We suffer and cause suffering from 
          not being able to merge with others, to incorporate them truly into ourselves.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          engineer questions: “Is this exactly where you want the ‘lozenge-shaped’ 
          universe, as you call it, to intersect with the ‘distance professors,’ 
          or a bit farther on?”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          writer says: “Technically, the work began with the story I wrote while 
          spending four days camping on an alluvial fan in Death Valley. Michael 
          Sumner (my partner) had suggested the idea that the energy used in ‘walking 
          away’ simply makes a person get physically smaller but they do not literally 
          move farther away, and the process is reversible.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Robert 
          Ashley wanted to read the piece aloud. He sent me his recording and I 
          was surprised by the pacing (he always surprises me). I asked Joan to 
          do a reading as counterpoint. The night she returned from Iceland she 
          recorded the text and delivered it the next morning as I was leaving for 
          Australia. I had been invited as “Creative Media Arts Fellow 2000” to 
          present my work at University of Technology in Sydney, and to produce 
          a radio work for ABC Radio Arts. The audiowork took form, derived from 
          dreaming at night, radio broadcasts in the early morn, and using the material 
          brought along.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“One 
          day the executive producer suggested, don’t you want to use a few actors? 
          I said I’ve never worked with actors! He said, these actors are very intelligent. 
          After the third gentle suggestion from this tall kind human being I said 
          yes, okay, and he said they will be here tomorrow. I went home and wrote 
          the playlet that is the final act. Releasing us back into the everyday 
          world.”</font></p>

          Sumner Carnahan has worked with musicians, composers, and artists for 
          the past seventeen years providing stories and texts for performances, 
          audioworks, installations, and film. She received an MFA from Mills College 
          studying at the Center for Contemporary Music where she began collaborating 
          with Laetitia Sonami—an on-going collaboration in which Carnahan words 
          are used for Sonami’s “performance novel” works. Commissions have come 
          from New York’s Experimental Intermedia Foundation, New American Radio, 
          CBC in Canada, NTT/ICC in Tokyo, and ABC in Sydney, Australia, where Carnahan 
          was Creative Media Arts Fellow 2000, writing and producing a half-hour 
          audiowork, <i>The X, Y, Z of It,</i> with the voices of Robert Ashley 
          and Joan La Barbara. Her short works have been published in over thirty-five 
          magazines and anthologies, and she has five books in print, including 
          her IPPY award-winning audiofiction from Frog Peak, <i>The Time Is Now</i>— 
          a collaboration with fourteen composers. Four of her stories are included 
          on Morton Subotnick’s <i>Gestures,</i> a DVD-CDrom release from Mode records, 
          2001. Charles Shere wrote in <i>the Oakland Tribune,</i> “There have been 
          few precedents to this kind of sustained avant-garde literature with a 
          moving human content.” Kyle Gann in <i>the Village Voice</i> described 
          Carnahan’s writing as “The most musical prose since Gertrude Stein.” A 
          founding editor of Burning Books, Carnahan was a long-time resident of 
          the San Francisco Bay Area. She lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</font></p>

          orchestra and interactive technology, using a unique vocabulary of experimental 
          and extended vocal techniques that have become her “signature sounds.” 
          She has received awards and honors including seven N.E.A. grants and the 
          prestigious DAAD Artist-in Residency in Berlin. La Barbara composed and
