                It’s been like this.  On the beach a few bathers engage in a swimming 
                competition.  They have to reach the approaching barge as quickly 
                as possible.  The sun is as radiant as the embrace I want to give 
                you.  I touch your body embalmed with oils.  I moisten my lips with 
                yours.  I try to embrace you.  A wide ocean saturated with seaweed 
                covers the sand.  Like a petroleum spill that discreetly slips in, 
                clearing the fish and their neighbors, eliminating the ocean’s rosebud 
                and the color of sandstone.  I try to embrace you.  Let me be that 
                tangle of seaweed that barely allows bathers to walk.  Let me make 
                my mark like the black stain that covers pelicans.  I try to embrace 
                you, with a hold that approximates the straight line of death.</font></p>
              <p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2.  
                It continues being like this, at night I confuse you with the women 
                that walk at the edge of the road.  I see their muscular backs, 
                carrying the jeans they tend to wear.  Their tits barely covered 
                by some second-hand sweater.  They walk alone, unaware, their lips 
                puckered with rage, like when taking me you open my web and all 
                of its spiders.  Try to squeeze me now with your salivous mineral. 
                Bite this whip without shame, listen to its nocturnal surge.  Above, 
                the moon, and some shooting star with her sparkling tale.</font></p>

                It’s been like this, sitting here thinking about my wife. Obsessed, 
                she’s taken to the street to look for me, to find each of my fingerprints.  
                She has told me that she would not delay in denouncing me, that 
                she would bite my skin and its odors.  I am here, trying to explain 
                to her my surroundings, full of individuals that suck my adipose 
                fiber.  My bedroom is merely an empty drawer.  I try loving her.  
                Violently, her clothes become dislocated, she opens her delicate 
                lip and we cross, entangled, her wood’s knots.  The spider web’s 
                territory opens.  The bedroom becomes impregnated with her usual 
                perfume. Horrified, I listen, listen to her cat’s meow.  Feel, I 
                feel her rabid teeth drain my lips.  Smell, I smell her stench. 
                Howl, I howl even though there’s no full moon and I am hairless.  
                Even like this, I love her.  It has always been like this:  love 
                and its hidden defects.</font></p>

                my neighbor alarmingly pointed out that my stare resembles a cat’s 
                stare. —I should take this as a compliment.  I said.  She tried, 
                in some way, to compare her own animal’s secrecy with the loneliness 
                of my pupils, her feline’s unsociable manner with my independent 
                ways.  Her wisdom was shocking, and she told me of medieval superstition.</font></p>

                been found in numerous Egyptian excavations.  The pharaohs had a 
                deep admiration for this animal.</font></p>

                same contracting pupils that dilate and shrink at the slightest 
                change in light. —Is it a compliment? I ask her again, and I imagine 
                the neighborhoods cats hanging from roofs, with their remarkable 
                sense of balance, extremely exhausted from happiness.</font></p>

                could hear my great repertory of sounds. I could taste my whiskers 
                emerging from the corners of my mouth.  I saw myself walking elegantly 
                dressed in silky blue hair. I could enter anyone’s home, submerge 
                myself in any bed,  caress the most deserving head.  Is it really 
                a compliment? And I began to meow trying to express various emotions.  
                I moved slowly, lowered my ears, shook my tail, marked my territory 
                with one intense stream of urine.  I imagine I’m a mountain cat, 
                my ancestors likely to have come directly from the jungle, but I’m 
                probably more than just a small feline, round-headed.  I curled 
                up warmly, needy, purring and I saw myself walking among orange 
                trees and violets with tall and lonely Marina, while an eagle hovers, 
                waiting to devour me.</font></p>

                and I understood each other perfectly.  In her mind, I am the perfect 
                species of domestic cat, she knows exactly what I want by the tone 
                of my meow. She throws me the ball, I circle three times in the 
                air, and I land at the other end of the living room.</font></p>

                night I continue my habit of getting into any bed, purring into 
                the ear of my choice.  On many occasions I sit in front of a white 
                piece of paper, and I write this prose with the tips of my fingers; 
                I meditate at length on the little seahorses surrounding my house, 
                of the sharks circling the bay looking for entrails.  I caress my 
                thighs, I lather myself in perfumes, I turn on my car and head for 
                the street. That is why I think it’s a compliment.</font></p>
