              It’s been like this.  On the beach a few bathers engage in a swimming 
              competition.  They have to reach the approaching barge as quickly 
              as possible.  The sun is as radiant as the embrace I want to give 
              you.  I touch your body embalmed with oils.  I moisten my lips with 
              yours.  I try to embrace you.  A wide ocean saturated with seaweed 
              covers the sand.  Like a petroleum spill that discreetly slips in, 
              clearing the fish and their neighbors, eliminating the ocean’s rosebud 
              and the color of sandstone.  I try to embrace you.  Let me be that 
              tangle of seaweed that barely allows bathers to walk.  Let me make 
              my mark like the black stain that covers pelicans.  I try to embrace 
              you, with a hold that approximates the straight line of death.</font></p>
            <p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2.  
              It continues being like this, at night I confuse you with the women 
              that walk at the edge of the road.  I see their muscular backs, 
              carrying the jeans they tend to wear.  Their tits barely covered 
              by some second-hand sweater.  They walk alone, unaware, their lips 
              puckered with rage, like when taking me you open my web and all 
              of its spiders.  Try to squeeze me now with your salivous mineral. 
              Bite this whip without shame, listen to its nocturnal surge.  Above, 
              the moon, and some shooting star with her sparkling tale.</font></p>

              It’s been like this, sitting here thinking about my wife. Obsessed, 
              she’s taken to the street to look for me, to find each of my fingerprints.  
              She has told me that she would not delay in denouncing me, that 
              she would bite my skin and its odors.  I am here, trying to explain 
              to her my surroundings, full of individuals that suck my adipose 
              fiber.  My bedroom is merely an empty drawer.  I try loving her.  
              Violently, her clothes become dislocated, she opens her delicate 
              lip and we cross, entangled, her wood’s knots.  The spider web’s 
              territory opens.  The bedroom becomes impregnated with her usual 
              perfume. Horrified, I listen, listen to her cat’s meow.  Feel, I 
              feel her rabid teeth drain my lips.  Smell, I smell her stench. 
              Howl, I howl even though there’s no full moon and I am hairless.  
              Even like this, I love her.  It has always been like this:  love 
              and its hidden defects.</font></p>

              my neighbor alarmingly pointed out that my stare resembles a cat’s

              in some way, to compare her own animal’s secrecy with the loneliness 
              of my pupils, her feline’s unsociable manner with my independent 
              ways.  Her wisdom was shocking, and she told me of medieval superstition.</font></p>

              cat that accompanied witches was also persecuted, thought of as 
              an emissary of spells and curses.  Cats, carefully mummified, have 
              been found in numerous Egyptian excavations.  The pharaohs had a

              same contracting pupils that dilate and shrink at the slightest 
              change in light. —Is it a compliment? I ask her again, and I imagine 
              the neighborhoods cats hanging from roofs, with their remarkable 
              sense of balance, extremely exhausted from happiness.</font></p>

              could hear my great repertory of sounds. I could taste my whiskers 
              emerging from the corners of my mouth.  I saw myself walking elegantly 
              dressed in silky blue hair. I could enter anyone’s home, submerge 
              myself in any bed,  caress the most deserving head.  Is it really 
              a compliment? And I began to meow trying to express various emotions.  
              I moved slowly, lowered my ears, shook my tail, marked my territory 
              with one intense stream of urine.  I imagine I’m a mountain cat, 
              my ancestors likely to have come directly from the jungle, but I’m 
              probably more than just a small feline, round-headed.  I curled 
              up warmly, needy, purring and I saw myself walking among orange 
              trees and violets with tall and lonely Marina, while an eagle hovers,

              and I understood each other perfectly.  In her mind, I am the perfect 
              species of domestic cat, she knows exactly what I want by the tone 
              of my meow. She throws me the ball, I circle three times in the 
              air, and I land at the other end of the living room.</font></p>

              night I continue my habit of getting into any bed, purring into 
              the ear of my choice.  On many occasions I sit in front of a white 
              piece of paper, and I write this prose with the tips of my fingers; 
              I meditate at length on the little seahorses surrounding my house, 
              of the sharks circling the bay looking for entrails.  I caress my 
              thighs, I lather myself in perfumes, I turn on my car and head for 
              the street. That is why I think it’s a compliment.</font></p>
