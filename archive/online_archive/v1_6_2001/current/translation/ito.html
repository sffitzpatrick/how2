          “I”</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
          are many ways to say “I” in Japanese, and then we go around avoiding its 
          usage. Most of Ito’s writing takes place in the first person, where she 
          uses various means to refer to herself and others. In some cases, she 
          uses her own name (as well as that of her daughter) in third person with 
          various forms of address, confusing issues of authorship and verisimilitude.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ito 
          also uses the three systems of writing—<i>hiragana, katakana, </i>and<i> 
          kanji</i>—in unconventional ways. For example, the deliberate use of hiragana 
          gives a childish, innocent effect, as in the writing of a child who has 
          yet to learn the corresponding kanji. Katakana is essentially a phonetic 
          alphabet, mainly used for foreign words.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Part 
          of a living man] ——the English translation is littered with “I”s, yet 
          it appears only three times in the original Japanese text (where Ito uses 
          the term <i>atashi</i>, a female-specific “I” that has a young or naïve 
          quality). The speed and rhythm of this piece makes any use of “I” cumbersome 
          and unnecessary. Also, this piece shows evidence of the <i>sekkyo-bushi 
          </i>and<i> joruri<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] 
          </span></a></i> which form part of Ito’s influences—musically they reflect 
          a rushing sonority typical of these oral poetic traditions, while the 
          content has shifted dramatically to suit her needs.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Congratulations 
          on your destruction] ——Ito uses the most common <i>watashi</i>, but in 
          the last section refers to a “Hiromi”-san. If I were translating straightforward 
          prose I probably would not include the –san, but in this case the effect 
          is curious: the author implicates herself more directly in the story by 
          using her own name; meanwhile its formal, third-person form of address 
          creates an impersonal distance. Similarly, Kanoko is the name of her real 
          daughter, yet she writes her name using the katakana alphabet—creating 
          another distance.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Together] 
          ——we have Hiromi-chan, with her name in katakana. The –chan ending is 
          often used with children, girls in particular. With adults it is used 
          only for women, and is either intimate or condescending.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[Harakiri] 
          ——uses <i>watakushi</i>, the most formal way to say “I.” It goes along 
          with the archaic, refined and overly respectful tone of the poem. Although 
          it is more common and correct to write this in kanji, she writes it in 
          hiragana to distinguish it from the shortened, more commonly used <i>watashi</i>.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[The 
          dappled cat takes to the sky] —— the “I” is seldom articulated, and when 
          it is, as <i>watashi</i>, in hiragana.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          <b>profanity, taboos, appropriateness</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ito’s 
          usage of profanity and taboo is interesting when placed in the context 
          of the English language. It is always a challenge for me to figure out 
          what degree of “badness” each situation implies, because the sense of 
          badness itself is culturally very differently manifested. In Japan there 
          is no such thing as profanity, cursing, censorship of specific words—the 
          media seems to be more relaxed about such things than the American media. 
          Because Japanese language and culture have so much hierarchy structured 
          into it, it is assumed, and terribly important, that people understand 
          what is appropriate when—and thus no words are singled out as “bad,” as 
          is done in the US. In practice, the Japanese equivalent of English swear 
          words are never appropriate for women to say, but when they do use them, 
          it comes across sounding incorrect, or as if they are speaking like a 
          man. This is one of the many ways in which Ito’s writing breaks from Japanese 
          literary traditions, creating a tension between vocabulary which generally 
          falls outside the domain of female discourse, and the delivery of such 
          language in a writing style that reflects typical feminine speech patterns. 
          This style of feminine speech-like writing is practically impossible to 
          reproduce in translation, especially in a relatively democratic language 
          such as English. In “Part of a living man,” where this is most evident, 
          I tried to recreate the effect by preserving as much as possible the hesitant, 
          indecisive yet rushed quality of the writing, yet feel that it is still 
          quite far from the original.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          also came to suspect that the Japanese modesty about physical, bodily 
          matters are reflected in the dictionaries. Ordinarily it is quite simple 
          to look up any word in the extensively cross-indexed <i>kanwa</i> (chinese 
          character) dictionaries, but with many of the words which had to do with 
          the body, sex, or physiology, while they were indeed listed in the dictionary, 
          they were less thoroughly indexed, less accessible, than other, more standard 
          words.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
          <b>notes on “Congratulations on your destruction”</b></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          poem originally appeared in the early eighties, a time when Japanese society 
          was paying lavish attention to the glories of motherhood and maternal 
          instincts—it was the cultural tendency, and tended to celebrate it to 
          the exclusion of all else. “Congratulations on your destruction” came 
          at a time when it was completely impossible to imagine that a woman might 
          have such thoughts towards her child; there was no suggestion of it anywhere 
          in the public consciousness.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          intent of the poem is not to sensationalize, nor to celebrate the literal 
          destruction of the baby, but rather to upset the rigid social lines between 
          accepted, idealized female experience, and everything else which falls 
          outside. It foregrounds the very disparate treatment by family and friends 
          towards women who have just given birth, as opposed to women who have 
          had abortions, or women having difficulty coping with motherhood. While 
          this is rather characteristic of the general difficulty that Japanese 
          society has in dealing with difference of any kind, it is also probably 
          true that people in many cultures find it difficult to cope with such 
          non-idealized positions of female experience. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          poem is horrific—and Ito utilizes poetry’s ability to straddle between 
          fiction and reality to situate the poem inside the mind of a woman experiencing 
          her motherhood in a terrifying, abnormal way. The events are fictional, 
          yet the names are real—as are the original impulses that created the poem. 
          Ito brings forth the image of the dying bird as a metaphor for the human—which 
          is terrible in itself, but is amplified by the dissociated, removed tone 
          of the narrator. It depicts a mental state which may well be reached by 
          a woman at the end of her capacity to cope, and Ito forces the reader 
          to acknowledge that this state is in fact possible.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          seems that postwar Japanese literature often engages the disturbing side 
          of human nature—probing into incest, torture, violent acts towards other 
          people or animals, strange fascinations—and even if we don’t feel encouraged 
          to commit or even speak about these subjects, there remain residuals, 
          hints, notes that ring somewhere inside us, however faintly or loudly. 
          Literature, poetry, language—are all connected by the struggle to depict 
          or express “the overwhelming experience of the vastness and uncertainty 
          of the world, and by what often seems to be the inadequacy of the imagination 
          that longs to know it.”<a href="#_ftn2"
  name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a> Hejinian writes this in reference 
          to language poetry, in her discussion of open versus closed texts, yet 
          it can also be applied to a more content-driven work such as Ito’s, where 
          we are made uncomfortably aware of our own limitations and complexities.</font></p>

          yes<br>

          Actually, I had aborted a fetus that should have been much like Kanoko<br>
          The fetus that should have been much like Kanoko grew<br>
          Perhaps I could have kept<br>

          Congratulations on your destruction<br>
          Congratulations on your destruction<br>
          Congratulations on your destruction<br>
          I’ve had an abortion by curettage before<br>
          Congratulations on your destruction<br>
          Because your baby was so big<br>
          you’ll have milk, you know, the doctor said<br>
          and I don’t know how to react other than to laugh halfheartedly<br>
          laugh halfheartedly<br>
          laugh halfheartedly<br>
          halfhearted<br>
          halfhearted<br>
          But congratulations<br>
          The milk really came<br>
          so that if I pinched hard the white liquid oozed out<br>
          My breasts aren’t swollen and<br>
          I don’t feel a thing<br>
          don’t find it cute or anything<br>

          after all<br>
          It’s a happy event when milk comes out<br>
          from a place where there was nothing<br>
          something sweet and drinkable<br>
          comes gushing forth<br>
          and you can get fat on it<br>
          something similar to that<br>
          <span> </span>“milk” you pay money for<br>
          But I secrete it<br>
          excrete it like urine<br>
          excrete it like spit or tears or menstrual fluids<br>
          from my anus my mouth my urethra my vagina<br>
          this copious milk comes gushing out<br>
          and the happiness<br>
          and the joyfulness<br>
          Congratulations<br>
          I’ve had an abortion mid-pregnancy before<br>
          I inquired, was the baby a boy or was it a girl, but<br>
          it’d be lying to say it like that—was the <i>baby<br>
          </i>I have to call it a fetus<br>
          Of course they have it so they don’t tell me boy or girl<br>
          because the shock is too great<br>
          to the maternal body<br>
          The maternal body contemplates<br>
          whether it’s a female fetus like Kanoko or a male fetus like Kanoko<br>
          I’ve had gestosis before<br>
          I’ve had a hydatidiform mole before<br>
          went and saw all the lumpiness overflowing my uterus<br>
          And yes that too must be similar to Kanoko<br>
          I’ve had uterine cancer before<br>
          I’ve had my uterus and ovaries removed before<br>
          I’ve delivered a baby before<br>
          I’ve had an induced delivery because of uterine inertia before<br>
          I’ve had an episiotomy before<br>
          had a fun pregnancy before<br>
          My uterus filled up<br>
          My whole body engorged<br>
          I could overeat endlessly<br>
          and when I thought about delivery<br>
          could masturbate endlessly<br>
          I dread the near-approaching moment of delivery<br>
          twitching fingers of the cheerful mother-to-be<br>
          And so I’ve also breastfed before<br>
          Congratulations on your destruction<br>
          Six months pass<br>
          Kanoko’s teeth come in and<br>
          bite my nipple want to bite my nipple off<br>
          always looking for a chance to bite it off<br>
          Kanoko eats my time   and<br>
          Kanoko siphons off my nourishment   and<br>
          Kanoko wears away my appetite   and<br>
          Kanoko pulls my hair out   and<br>
          Kanoko forced me to clean up all her shit<br>
          I want to throw Kanoko away<br>
          to throw dirty Kanoko away<br>
          to throw away or kill Kanoko who bites my nipple off<br>
          before Kanoko spills my blood<br>
          I want to kill or throw her away<br>
          I’ve also committed infanticide before<br>
          have also abandoned an infant before<br>
          It’s easy if you do it right after giving birth<br>
          If you don’t get caught it’s easier than abortion<br>
          The confidence to get away with it,<br>
          that I have plenty<br>
          I can bury Kanoko again and again<br>
          Buried Kanoko Congratulations<br>
          Congratulations<br>
          Sex that I can’t not have<br>
          The numerous Kanokos I can’t avoid conceiving<br>
          The numerous Kanokos I can’t weed out<br>
          with the exception of one<br>
          which is the present Kanoko who<br>
          wants to bite my nipple off<br>

          this time three years ago<br>
          My close friend “Hiromi”-san’s motive for jumping to her death<br>
          was<br>
          “man-problems”<br>
          supposedly, but<br>
          “athlete’s foot”<br>
          seemed to have been <br>
          troubling her as well<br>
          Which is why “Hiromi”-san<br>
          meticulously hid the “athlete’s foot” on her toes with socks<br>
          Put on a pair of jeans<br>
          jumped<br>
          threw herself down<br>
          on the ground<br>
          The dead legs<br>
          of a quite attractive twenty-four year old woman<br>
          the belly into two<br>
          Even now, three years later I can’t help but picture it<br>
          Not that I even saw it but<br>
          dead legs, belly in two<br>
          dead legs, belly in two<br>

        <p align=right style='text-align:right'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          lost it, my temper<br>
          slammed Kanoko’s (six month) head<br>
          with the alarm clock that was close at hand<br>
          and Kanoko fell limp<br>
          wouldn’t flinch at all<br>
          even when I called and shook and hit her<br>
          I killed her I’ve done a terrible thing, I thought<br>
          got scared<br>
          left her just like that<br>
          and went out<br>
          When I returned home in about two hours<br>
          she appeared dead, as I had so feared<br>
          and black ants were swarming all over her body<br>
          and from where I had first placed her<br>
          she seemed to have moved just a tiny bit</font></p>
        <p align=right style='text-align:right'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          so I found struggling on the road<br>
          a sparrow<br>
          It was so very hot out and<br>
          rather than leave it on the parched road, I thought<br>
          first, to place it on the damp part on the side of the road<br>
          but it was still a road<br>
          and it had nowhere to hide, was still in danger, I thought<br>
          at least<br>
          the dirt<br>
          a place with some grass, I thought<br>
          and found such a place and put the sparrow there<br>
          and then stopped to take a look on my way home</font></p>

          Well, it seems<br>
          before I saw the sparrow<br>
          I had noticed all the ants nearby<br>
          but it didn’t occur to me there would be a connection<br>
          The sparrow, excepting its head<br>
          was crawling with ants<br>
          steadily making their way right up to its head<br>
          The sparrow was moving<br>
          its featherless wing, the flesh exposed<br>
          tense<br>
          was crying<br>
          while trying to escape the ants all over its body but</font></p>

          I<br>
          could touch the sparrow that was not teeming with ants but<br>
          could not touch the sparrow that was teeming with ants<br>
          Without doing a thing<br>
          I got out of there<br>
          Of course I am directly responsible<br>
          but somehow<br>
          I associated it with<br>
          Kanoko, teeming with ants and<br>
          discarded<br>
          It’s not that I am afraid of Kanoko<br>
          It’s the teeming immensity of the ants that scare me<br>

          once met with Mr. O, the harakiri fanatic, and inquired of him<br>

          for example which actor<br>

          Hmm…well…I’ve never given it much thought<br>
          Crossed his arms<br>
          looked up<br>

          The man who jumped from the Keio Plaza<br>
          I had always liked his face, back when he was alive, from long before<br>

          I inquired of him<br>
          secretly thinking of Oki Masaya disemboweling himself like Asano Takuminokami<br>
          in pure white kimono<br>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which 
          is to say, this is very easily done between girls. One declares she is 
          going to pee and squats down; another is invariably persuaded, pulls down 
          her underwear and squats. Not two, not three, but four girls line up facing 
          a ditch, pull on their underwear and release their pee.</font></p>

          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yumiko-chan’s 
          family comes from a long line of farmers, so their house was built as 
          a farmhouse. They have dirt floors, a large yard, a shed and an outhouse. 
          Right next to the outhouse was a night soil pit the size of a small pond, 
          and a bucket and scoop were left sitting out between the surrounding camellia 
          and devil-club shrubs. By this time Yumiko-chan’s parents had already 
          quit farming, so I doubt there was any actual night soil in the pit.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Me 
          too”<br>
          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and 
          immediately following, Hiromi-chan opened the outhouse door and said to

        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Can 
          you scoot up a little?”<br>
          </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and 
          pulled down her underwear and squatted down. Still squatting, Yumiko-chan 
          shuffles her feet forward, one at a time, and scoots her butt up. While 
          moving forward, she’s already started peeing. Hiromi-chan, too, starts 
          to pee.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(My 
          home faces East on the first floor of a six-story building. There is a 
          small yard attached.)</font></p>
       <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          the way, my cat in Tokyo is in heat right now. There is a plant covered 
          by a black plastic bag out on the patio, and this is where cats spray. 
          So cats are constantly coming and going on my patio, and each time they 
          stop and inspect this plastic bag. Usually I catch this as they’ve turned 
          their butts to me on their way out. Between the hind legs of these cats 
          pointing their butts at me, I often see their balls hanging. None of the 
          cats that come around are neutered. And these balls look more round than 
          usual. There’s some snow left on the ground. From diligently walking around 
          in it, their fur has gotten much shabbier than normal. However, what I 
          see as they leave is their scraggly butts, more joyous than usual. And 
          then comes the meowing. It’s a sweet cry. I’ve only heard the cries of 
          real human babies a handful of times so this is no accurate impression, 
          but I’m inclined to say that the meowing of these cats are much like the 
          cries of a human baby. I find myself investigating them, their source. 
          (I am holding the cat in heat in my belly.) When a cat leaves, I am left 
          with that stain-pocked butt and his two joyous balls. A pause, then the 
          meowing, then a different cat appears. There is no apparent connection 
          between the meowing and the appearance of the cat. But I take into account 
          the relationship between the two, anticipate some regularity in timing, 
          and wait for the cat to appear after the meowing. I’ve never seen an unspayed 
          tabby cat around here. The tomcats with stain-pocked butts and joyous 
          balls never find what they’re looking for.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          the way, Tsuda-san, my next door neighbor, keeps six cats in the same 
          space as my apartment. I’m not all that close with Tsuda-san, but she 
          gave me a cat once, and I’ve been inside her house. Of course these six 
          cats aren’t too friendly with someone who’s been over only two or three 
          times, but when I went there most recently, one of the six was in heat, 
          and she came and rubbed up against me, lifting and lowering her butt and 
          meowing incessantly. This is the cat that, normally when you approach 
          her, would brace her head down low and put out her claws. This tabby cat 
          in heat was the only one that would let me hold her. She kept her claws 
          in, leaned her weight on me, and continued her up-down butt motion on 
          my shoulder. The other five cats have all been neutered. These six cats 
          are all kept within screen doors. If you open the same front door as mine, 
          she has the same wallpaper as I, and in the entryway with the same shoe-closet 
          as mine, she keeps the litter box. The kitty litter and shreds of newspaper 
          are dry, but there is a slight odor in the area. It’s more the smell of 
          urine than of shit. Inside the room there are very few furnishings—just 
          a dresser, a dining table, and a plastic box lined with plants. The plants 
          are neatly wrapped in plastic or newspaper and tied with string. And in 
          the corner are cages and baskets for the cats, with the doors open, where 
          the cats go and rest as they like. There are cats lurking on the dresser, 
          behind the dresser, under the table, inside the plastic box. Only the 
          cat in heat comes out into the lit area where people are, rubbing up against 
          the floor and walls, raising and lowering her butt. Tsuda-san looks about 
          thirty-five, six. She started keeping cats after her divorce. Once she 
          started, she ended up with many. She’s had children. She’s also had a 
          miscarriage. She drops these things into the conversation as if it were 
          nothing. Her story never develops beyond that. I know Tsuda-san’s last 
          name but not her first. Her six cats, I know all their names. The one 
          in heat is named Julie.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By 
          the way, I wanted to write about my friend who always wants to talk about 
          the anus and defecating. She talks about the anus and defecating as much 
          as she talks about her husband. We’ve been close friends for about fifteen 
          years now. It’s not that all we have in common to talk about are husbands 
          and anuses. We met each other before or after our first periods. Neither 
          of us had had sex yet. Even after we’d met, neither of us had sex for 
          years. In the fifteen years we’ve known each other, the time in which 
          we’ve had sex regularly is shorter than the time before that. What we 
          normally do is that I call her after a certain amount of time has passed. 
          We talk like we did fifteen years ago, she tells me about her anus, and 
          I take it in. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The

        <p style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          hate dead flies, you know, but then again, even if they’re not dead, even 
          if they’re alive, they just give me the chills. Like they carry some vestige 
          of a previous life—it really scares me. So, except for the fly, normally 
          we gape at corpses, right, and in that case, going from the fly to the 
          fish, fish to mouse, and then to the cat, or something, and so the more 
          distant it gets from myself, there’s less a sense of that revolting surprise, 
          I think. Corpses are really, well, scary, right. Corpses are things that, 
          deep in my heart, I’m always thinking that I want to see. So then, watching 
          the river go by, I watch it, thinking, I want to see a corpse, I want 
          to see a corpse. Lots of things go by, right, like trash, small stuff, 
          bubbles, and among them, isn’t there something better, I think, like a 
          corpse? and I’m always looking out for it. Sometimes, well, a mouse floats 
          by, or more often a fish, and when I see it I think—<i>there it is</i>. 
          A mouse, you see, it’s got hair, and it’s all wet, and you know in an 
          instant as you see it floating down that its body is all hard. Usually 
          its mouth is half open, I might see teeth or something. And so then—<i>there 
          it is</i>—I feel this more strongly with a mouse than with a fish. Even 
          more so with a cat. I get all giddy. Tickled. And then—if, perhaps, a 
          human were to come floating down, well, it’s like—<i>bingo!</i> Of course 
          it’s rather creepy, and it’s strange to say it makes me happy, but it’s 
          something like that, I think. But, so, you have the corpse, right, and 
          it catches my eye right away, takes my breath away, and I jump back, at 
          first. It’s revolting. I don’t think it’s quite the same thing as getting 
          chills. Neither can I call it just plain scary. It’s kind of like, something 
          eerie. No, I don’t want to touch it. Even pointing at it makes me feel 
          like there’s something on the tip of my finger, something sort of sticky, 
          viscous, see? Now this is totally different from, well, that. Imagining 
          killing someone, or depicting it somehow, reading something about that, 
          and, um, masturbating is, after all—well there’s the act of killing, or 
          being killed, that is, someone besides myself is being killed, you see. 
          Me I’m just watching it. And as for the one that is getting killed, it’s 
          no good unless it’s a woman, and a young woman at that, you see. So she 
          gets hurt, and suffers, and dies, right, so there is suffering, right, 
          and this is what I’m watching. So. I get excited. How do I say this. It’s 
          like, I’m dissatisfied if there isn’t that sense of suffering. It’s as 
          if that feeling gets transferred over to my own body, and then, well, 
          it gives me pleasure. And not that it’s really transferred, the suffering 
          she feels, but in my own emotions, it switches into the pleasure from 
          masturbating, and then, I can feel it, it’s like, well, my interest in 
          death, it was there in the first place, and I think there’s something 
          else there as well, but let’s say it was there in the first place, and 
          then yes, something like masturbating, which I did when I was younger, 
          right, and then, well, there’s suffering, and then death, dying, right, 
          that, and masturbating is, when you’re doing it, gradually your breathing 
          gets rough, and then, you reach something like orgasm, then you’re finished, 
          right, and this process is the same; now I don’t know because I’ve never 
          seen a real death, but it’s like that in the deaths you see on TV and 
          all. And you perform, as if suffering, as if close to intoxication, and 
          it was the same, as the deal with masturbating. And then, well, dying. 
          Well it’s different from suffering, but I wonder if it isn’t the same. 
          So you see, if there’s no death there’s no orgasm. And that’s why when 
          there’s no real death, like plain old S&amp;M-type stuff, it isn’t that 
          exciting. If you’re not suffering, your breathing doesn’t get rough, right? 
          But really, it does, in reality. So, well, yes, there needs to be suffering. 
          And so, for example, when I’m reading Chikamatsu, <i>Chestnuts—dry shreds—hands 
          offered thy moon, gasping stumbles of final writhing breath</i> or, <i>Buddha’s 
          sword gashes toward—twists, remembers, how this—rolling unto pain</i>, 
          I get all excited. And then, right here, the hipbone, I think, the part 
          of the hipbone that sticks out, the part you can roll with your knuckles, 
          here, well I’d imagine that if you take a heavy kind of sword, swiftly 
          gash right in at an angle from the front, that it’d feel good, I think 
          this often. But when another poet writes <i>Hinged waist slit open, sharp, 
          in a moment floored</i>, there isn’t much suffering so it doesn’t really 
          move me. It’s all a fabrication, right? It’s not real. It’s all performance. 
          Like acting or comics or books. I can’t help but think that even if it 
          really happened, once it’s put down in words it turns into a fabrication. 
          And then, these pictures of dead people, well they’re already dead. For 
          me, as I look at these, I suppose that these people are already in rigor 
          mortis, that they’re all white and waxy, or, or that they, they must be 
          rotting away, is what I thought as I looked at them. And so then, whether 
          they’re cut through the stomach or the heart, it’s just until they die, 
          see, and this is all after that, you see, so for a living person to go 
          on and die, though they’re dying, and so I think that getting excited 
          at the scene where the woman gets killed, and the desire to see a corpse, 
          well I have a feeling they’re probably completely different things. Yes, 
          yes it’s different. Probably, I have a feeling it’s different. No, I feel 
          that it is different. Curiosity. Excitement. Well, for as long as you 
          look at it in the form of a photograph, I don’t think there’s much excitement 
          in seeing a corpse. But, if I could actually witness a real death, a murder, 
          I bet I’d get excited. But a corpse, after all, might not be something 
          you can really get excited about. It’s kind of—it’s sort of like being 
          held down, or like, heading towards, towards the interior. A corpse feels 
          like a <i>thing</i>, I think there’s a <i>thingness</i> to it. So my mom 
          is fat, right, and when she gets naked, you see these big huge chunks 
          of meat stuck on her, that are her back and her belly. And then it’s not 
          just like extra meat on a normal person’s body, no, it’s got a thickness 
          to it, and when you touch it, it sort of gives, you can grab on to it. 
          <i>A freak!</i> is how I felt. It’s a <i>thing</i>, I thought. And that 
          was what was so funny about it, or rather, you couldn’t get sick of it, 
          or you could kind of get into it, and it’s not that I get excited, but 
          it’s just so fascinating that I find myself staring at it, it’s kind of 
          like that, that feeling that I get. With interest. So then, if you remember, 
          the Elephant Man—he was popular at one point—that, I bet, was kind of 
          similar, I thought. And then, why is this so, I wondered, but, well, a 
          human body becomes a thing, gets objectified when I look at it, I think. 
          And then, well, I also wonder if a human body isn’t a thing in the first 
          place, but, okay, in the first place, a person is the same as a person, 
          right, my body is the same as your body; we’re the same that way, I think, 
          but, when its shape gets deformed like that, it’s no longer the same, 
          see, it becomes something different. And what is that something different, 
          well, it’s a thing, or, an object, a substance, right, although it was 
          originally the same thing, when it becomes something different it becomes 
          all the more piqued, I think, my interest. And then, so a corpse is, after 
          all, kind of like that, um, I think it was originally the same, right, 
          but that it’s different, something like that, it’s like it becomes something 
          different, or, it’s turned into something different, by death, yes, by 
          death. We’re interested in things that are the same as us, right. And 
          we feel somewhat distant from anything different. And then, here’s something 
          that was once the same as me and now is different—I wonder if it isn’t 
          even more interesting because of that, and then, even that, it’s like, 
          it’s one thing if it’s still living, but a corpse, well it’s really a 
          thing, has really turned into an object. The difference is even greater, 
          so all the more the desire to see it, I think. Oh! um, you bite, right? 
          When you get excited you might bite down; I wonder if it isn’t like that, 
          although I don’t really know. Biting, it’s like, when you get carried 
          away and you just chomp down, well you bite someone else, right, someone 
          else’s body is living but to me it’s a thing, right, and to bite, it’s 
          like, a thing, it’s really a thing, I want to confirm that it is, is why 
          I bite it, I suspect, normally in a relationship, after all even if you’re 
          having sex and it’s really a thing but it isn’t a thing, right, and when 
          I bite, it’s like, my teeth, there’s something that gives resistance to 
          my teeth, right, near the gums. Yes, when I see my partner’s body for 
          the first time, it reminds me of that. Yes, a corpse, too. So that process 
          of thingness, turning from something living, into a corpse. Yes, it’s 
          there. I think it’s different. I don’t think it’s sadness. I don’t know, 
          I’ve never witnessed the death of someone I would get sad for. It’s different, 
          I don’t think it’s sadness. Maybe it’s just that they disappear. Spiritually. 
          The existence of the person. If it was something I killed, cut, myself, 
          I don’t think I’d be scared. Because it wasn’t dead in the first place. 
          Yes, so I did the killing myself, right. In my hands, for example, if 
          it were Sada Abe, it’d be wildly shaking, if you were choked you’d be 
          shaking, I think I had that feeling, and then—death, right. The way I 
          feel, a man while he’s living, a thing, after all he was a thing as well, 
          I think, I kind of feel like he consisted of thingness, and, in the case 
          of Sada Abe, it was regarded as a thing in the first place, and then it 
          just happened to have become a genuine thing is all, I think. And so with 
          sex, with liking, loving someone, if I was bound by these strong feelings, 
          I think I could do it too, could choke a man to death, mess around with 
          his corpse without feeling one bit afraid. Yep, I could. The whole process 
          of the murder of a living thing, I was there, right, and now he’s dead, 
          right, and laying on the floor. So even dead he’s still the same human, 
          right. In one sense he turned from a thing into a thing, in another, from 
          a living thing into a living thing, even if the substance of it changed 
          a little, I think it was only just a transfer. I think. And so he dies, 
          right, he falls limp, right, and I wonder what it takes for me to go out 
          of my senses, if it’s about the same, how I myself will come to die, I 
          don’t really get it. If you go and think about it, when you get choked, 
          because you get stifled, your windpipe is obstructed and you can’t breathe 
          anymore. You don’t get oxygen and you die from suffocation, in that sort 
          of condition, but when you don’t get oxygen, I don’t really get what happens 
          to what parts, how the lack of oxygen affects the body and leads to death. 
          But if you think about it it’s like that, right. If you go and analyze 
          it more and more. If I sit and really think about it it’s just change, 
          death is. Biological. Which is why it isn’t scary. I don’t think Sada 
          Abe was thinking about this as he killed, pulling hairs out. But if you 
          actually were to do the killing part, your eyes would get fixated, right, 
          and when you’re fixated, one by one, the parts combine to make a whole, 
          and each part becomes visible, suffering, the inability to breathe, shaking, 
          limpness, not breathing, and each single element, when they’re all combined, 
          amount to murder and death, but each single element is a single circumstance. 
          So the penis was cut off, right, carried around, right, close to the skin, 
          blood seeping, and in that, squishy, a thing just like when it was living, 
          I think, it was just like when it was living, part of a living man.</font></p>
