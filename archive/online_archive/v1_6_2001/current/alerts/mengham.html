        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the long poem “Ten Prolegomena to Heartbreak,” which is the penultimate 
          text in <i>Imagination Verses</i> (Tender Buttons, 1996), the speaker 
          reveals her wish that she, and not Frank O’Hara, had been the author of 
          “In Memory of My Feelings,” a poem whose title suggests a dual focus: 
          a commemoration of something dead, on the one hand, and on the other hand 
          an attempt to recover those feelings and bring them alive in poetry.  
          It may be this kind of dual perspective that is being referred to in another 
          poem, “The Waver in the Orbit of Uranus Becomes Unexplainable” in the 
          phrase “parallax of heart”: “I ask you, is it fitting to undo me by leaving 
          / now that we know there is nothing out there / beyond what we can see? 
          / I admit I’ve suffered from a ‘parallax of heart,’ / born of a skewing 
          jealousy and seen most evenings / in field-weary gazing upon your sleeping 
          body. / From that angle all other worlds look bleak”(69).  Parallax is 
          the apparent change in the position of a heavenly body when viewed from 
          different points; when viewed from opposite points on the earth’s surface 
          this change is called the <i>daily</i> or <i>diurnal</i> or <i>geocentric 
          parallax</i>, and when viewed from opposite points of the earth’s orbit, 
          the <i>annual</i> or <i>heliocentric parallax.</i>  What I want to do 
          is discuss the potential of this figure for exploring the poetry of Jennifer 
          Moxley, first with reference to the memory of feeling, then with reference 
          to cultural memory, then with regard to the relationship between these 
          two things; and finally I want to ask whether we can think about there 
          being any Anglo-American dimension to this relationship.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
          seems to me that there’s a fundamentally parallactical procedure operating 
          in Moxley’s poetry, and that once can begin to try to describe the manner 
          of its operation in a poem like “Cast of Shadows.”  It’s a poem which 
          is certainly heliocentric in its fashion, and which takes as its occasion 
          a recognition of the scale of the annual parallax, referred to here as 
          the moment when “the yearly hoax begins”(61).  The title is parallactical 
          of course; from one angle it allows us to see shadows cast by the sun; 
          from another, a shadowy cast of characters who have disappeared but who 
          have left behind traces, in the predications and attributions, of trickery, 
          cowardice, vituperation, denial, mockery, mismating...</font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These 
          stanzas are over-crowded and unwieldy, slightly weighed down with ballast 
          as if to compensate for a liability to drift, as if to make up for the 
          uncertainty of a reader who seeks but fails to locate easily a main clause 
          or the principle on which dependent clauses are related to each other.  
          The overall movement of the poem is spasmodic, comprised of alternately 
          bunching and stretching rhythms that remind me of the experience of reading 
          certain of John Wieners’ poems in <i>Behind the State Capitol.</i>  The 
          slight but persistent displacement in syntactical terms is accompanied 
          by a semantic waywardness, by the use of several vocabularies that are 
          relatively resistantto collocation in the linguist’s sense.  This dislocation 
          of vocabularies is activated primarily by a project of attribution, by 
          the need to identify an antagonist (in other poems an interlocutor or 
          addressee) through the accumulation of attributes.  Attribution sustains 
          but also dislocates feelings of antagonism and complexifies questions 
          of agency; anomalous items of vocabulary are superimposed on one another 
          and bonded together in a series of protective laminates that offer some 
          displacement from the origin of hurt.  This displacement, or parallactic 
          removal, reducing vulnerability, has a similar motivation to that of the 
          impulse to deflate the antagonist that is virtually uppermost in the intentions 
          of the poem “Kalypso Facto”:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The matrix 
            of your hamstrung home-life<br>
            is undercutting all my generous gifts.<br>
            The current temper is such that soon<br>
            even the most bedlamite among us<br>
            will be threatened by marriage.  Such<br>
            unalienable boundaries are bringing distrust<br>
            to all frolicers.  Now the clouds show Zeus<br>
            is arriving to muck us up even further.<br>
            That hopped-up interventionist is thieving<br>
            all my island’s hidden treason.  His loud<br>
            armaments have been making petit fours<br>
            of continents for far too long.  Now you<br>

            with Enyo.  Your indiscretion may dress-up<br>
            progress in money lending but trembling<br>
            at the horizon I hear those othered lands.<br>

            of our jilted memory.(58)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          interesting thing about this work of the “jilted memory” is the parallactic 
          effect of the speaker’s knowledge of her abandonment combined with her 
          use of a present tense appropriate to the time of ignorance before the 
          event has taken place.  Her defiance of the Ulyssean figure is managed 
          partly by her conscripting herself into the company of “all frolicers”—hers 
          is a desperately frolicsome poem.  The cartoon mythology is characteristic 
          of a significant number of Moxley’s poems.  The mythological figures always 
          appear stripped of their cultural epaulettes, always demoted in rank by 
          a poet who is always overly familiar with them.  This heavily distorted 
          stock in trade is often automatically Americanized; thus Apollo is “mussed” 
          and “holster-wearing”(61).  The antagonism here is with a tradition of 
          “distant palaver,” so distant that distortion is inevitable(61).  Cultural 
          disalienation (through Americanization) is cross-hatched, however, with 
          emotional estrangement.  The technique of cultural appropriation is even 
          more scandalously employed in the poems that advertise their antagonism 
          with the history of English poetry, most obviously the two “duets” with 
          Wordsworth and Keats (62-63), which are really duels.  Here, the words 
          of Wordsworth’s and Keats’s poems are simply edited and rearranged, in 
          a clear case of cultural parallax, where the “apparent change in the disposition 
          of the object is caused by a change of position in the observer”: English 
          poetry undergoing mutation when viewed from a different point on the earth’s 
          surface.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          memory of feelings results in a technique of systematic distractions and 
          so does the memory of English poetry.  What complicates this situation 
          is that the distracted language of feelings is often simultaneously the 
          language of English poetry.  If we are looking for an Anglo-American dimension 
          in the work of this writer, this is not to be considered in terms of influence, 
          but as a reflection of its characteristically profound dislocations.  
          Perhaps the most striking of its culturally dislocated vocabularies is 
          that of social relationships, which are often given a curiously Anglo-Norman 
          colouring.  In “The Waver in the Orbit of Uranus Becomes Unexplainable,” 
          threats to the authority of the speaker are conceived of in terms of “pretenders 
          to the throne” and the necessity for banishment (69).  In “Bi-Coastal 
          Fleshings” and “The Nuptial Life,” social rank is indicated by class and 
          gentry status.  In the same two poems, power relationships are mapped 
          in terms of feudal allegiance (“down that rabbit hole my liege”(12)) and 
          patronage (“even bored henchmen / would find this outfit tempting”(57)).  
          And in “Cast of Shadows” humanity is categorised as a “coterie”(61), which 
          in its original Norman-French sense meant “a number of peasants holding 
          land jointly from the same lord.”  What’s particularly striking about 
          this vocabulary is that it refers to a set of social relationships for 
          which the cement is loyalty, and this has an obvious bearing on the emotional 
          scenarios to which it alludes.  It works to confirm the value of feelings 
          at the same time as it distracts the attention powerfully away from them.  
          There is no doubt that it is incorporated into the text in an ostentatiously 
          theatrical manner.  Most important of all, it is an obviously imported 
          vocabulary.  Moxley’s work shows a strong interest in the quarantine status 
          of certain vocabularies.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And, 
          correspondingly, in the vocabulary of quarantine, of emigration and incursion, 
          of the permeability of boundaries and borders.  Of “unalienable boundaries” 
          in “Kalypso Facto”; of interventionism and the horizon of cultural difference: 
          “trembling / at the horizon I hear those othered lands” and of the division 
          and re-division of territory: “His loud/armaments have been making petit 
          fours / of continents for far too long”(58), in “Kalypso Facto,” and “There 
          you are in the hinterland chiselling / Nations” in “Fin de Siecle Go-Betweens”(13).  
          The maintenance and breaching of national and cultural boundaries are 
          activities amplified by references to natural thresholds in “The Waver 
          in the Orbit of Uranus Becomes Unexplainable”: “I suspect the water’s 
          edge is enamoured of the water” and “I have never seen planet X / or the 
          wooden ships on the eastern horizon”(69).  The introjection and incorporation 
          of cultural dividing-lines is recognized in the title of “Bi-Coastal Fleshings.”  
          One poem which illustrates well the overlap between the memory of feelings 
          and wider questions of integration and expulsion is “Fin de Siecle Go-Betweens”:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
            you are in the hinterland chiseling<br>
            Nations into the ocean as I await torrential<br>
            winds.  In our search for beauty we’ve left<br>
            our footprints for the Native informers of narcissism<br>
            to uncover once we’ve fled.  We should have let<br>
            the out-of-work jesters jingle gun toters<br>
            and just gone on with the Eros of coastal waters.<br>
            I’ll hide your lesser self inside this bird of paradox,<br>
            a place dispatchers won’t mistake it for any<br>
            errant sign of life.  While we’ve been talking<br>
            they’ve lined up along the border towns<br>
            heavy with wistfulness, so if ever lip service<br>
            might save the planet let’s hope it’s now,<br>
            jettison that charm however and we might be<br>
            the end of something gathered.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It’s 
          worth remembering at this point how Frank O’Hara’s own poem “In Memory 
          of My Feelings” has a scenario in which a personal history is located 
          within the history of American culture, and is located within it polymorphously; 
          the way in which O’Hara’s speaker metamorphoses, inhabiting a whole series 
          of different cultural identities one after another, is perhaps reflected 
          in the instability of borders in “Fin de Siecle Go-Betweens.”  It is almost 
          as if there are as many potential sets of borders as there are observers.  
          Of course, the politically motivated version of this re-drawing of borders 
          is gerrymandering, an idea that comes up in “Cast of Shadows.” The term 
          is happily an American one: the first instance of reconstituting an electoral 
          district with a view to political advantage is supposed to have been the 
          work of Governor Elbridge Gerry, who in 1811 produced the shape of a salamander 
          by re-drawing the map of Massachusetts.  A clear case of the parallax 
          view in which an object is revised from a purely personal perspective.  
          The object of gerrymandering in “Cast of Shadows” is, perhaps unsurprisingly, 
          “love interests”(61).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          extensive use of a vocabulary concerned to negotiate the demarcation-line 
          between “ham-strung home-life” and “othered lands” is not, as I hope I’ve 
          made clear, part of an allegorization of emotional trauma.  It is rather 
          part of the parallax effect of a writing that is constantly taking the 
          measure of its own displacement from a source of ambivalent power.  The 
          constant renegotiation of position is an activity passed on to the reader 
          who is made aware of the angle of incidence between different ways of 
          interpreting the same material.  “I’m a camera gathering brightness / 
          my ligature of future imaginings” is the declaration of “Bi-Coastal Fleshings,” 
          with the enjambment, or ligature, between the two lines allowing the knowledge 
          of an aperture, or opening-up, to underlie the apprehension of ligature 
          as surgical closing-off: the negotiation of a threshold that is simultaneously 
          permeable and impermeable.  Like the threshold between English and American 
          poetry: “That hopped-up interventionist is thieving / all my island’s 
          hidden treason,” the object of the theft being a buried treasure, whose 
          cultural legacy is as treacherous as it is irresistible.  A connoisseur 
          of mistranslations, both between languages and cultures and within them, 
          the poet insists on a parallactic gesture, not just to offset damage, 
          but also to find an equivalent means of countering the potential for cultural 
          and emotional wiliness and misconstruction.  Gerrymandering syntax, discourse 
          and the tradition, Moxley is engaged in a continual reconstitution of 
          her Americanness, one of whose verges, perhaps the largest, is clipped 
          by an English accent.  </font></p>
