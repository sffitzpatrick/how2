          <i>A Pamphlet Against Anthologies</i> (1928), Laura Riding and Robert 
          Graves discuss many of the 68 anthologies they claim to have examined, 
          anthologies from ancient Roman and Greek times to the 1920s. (“Pamphlet” 
          is a bit misleading, at almost 200 pages, though the word does allude 
          to their attempt to intervene with some immediacy in the contemporary 
          poetry book market). The popular or trade anthology has been around since 
          those ancient times; the true anthology has been as well, though less 
          often. Trade anthologies are singularly profitable: a “publisher knows 
          well enough that poetry cannot pay its printer’s bills except in the form 
          of standard text-books, nursery verse and anthologies”(26). The editors 
          of trade collections tend to damage the identity even of work written 
          against the anthology context, once it’s been absorbed: “The aim of the 
          popular anthologist is to make a single book out of clippings from many 
          books; to create a composite author who shall be a mean struck between 
          all the poets included”(67). Leah Price has also commented recently on 
          “the power of anthologies to cleanse their raw material of its generic 
          origin”(78). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Riding 
          and Graves define the true anthology strictly, as either a sort of scrapbook 
          of unmotivated material—motivated only by an individual need to write, 
          without the desire for publicity—or a book that rescues material on its 
          way to oblivion: “Popular ballads, epitaphs, squibs, stray lyrics and 
          even longer poems that have irretrievably lost author and date, may be 
          fittingly united in a volume of non-classifiable verse; and this is always 
          a legitimate use of the anthology”(11). It’s the poetry that produces 
          the need for a true anthology, a poetry of stray lyrics; but in 1928 Riding 
          and Graves sense that the day when it’s the trade anthology that produces 
          the poetry was already upon them.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
          does poetry belong any more naturally in a single author volume than in 
          an anthology? Where does poetry belong? What is its natural habitat? At 
          least since Donald Allen’s <i>The New American Poetry</i> (1960) anthology, 
          poetry has appeared as a collective enterprise, rather than an individual 
          one. (<i>The New American Poetry</i> concludes with 43 poets, only 4 of 
          whom are women.) A single author book suggests a writer in solitude; an 
          anthology suggests a writer in community. An emphasis on community or 
          context over text naturalizes the anthology; it is not the place to be, 
          but the place you are. For the reader too—there is a tradition in the 
          editor’s preface to “present the anthology as the effect of an audience’s 
          cohesion rather than its cause”(Price 70). Supposedly an anthology doesn’t 
          create a unified culture, but represents it. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          her 1960 review of <i>The New American Poetry</i>, Marianne Moore takes 
          a moment to respond to Charles Olson’s notorious principle of “composition 
          by field,” articulated in his influential essay “Projective Verse”(1950), 
          and included in the anthology. According to Olson, the poet must be aware 
          of what’s happening as he writes, how to recognize that instant by instant 
          a poem changes its location. To write but fail to recognize that a poem’s 
          place and trajectory have changed betrays the poem as a thing of energy. 
          A poet must be open and let a new perception happen—a breath in forces 
          a breath out. A poem without a certain speed is like holding your breath 
          till you’re blue in the face. Moore observes that for her “a work may 
          be said to have form in so far as one part leads a reader to anticipate 
          another part and be gratified by the result”(538). Moore touches on the 
          tension in poetry between the centrifugal (difference) and the centripetal 
          (resemblance); use that tension productively, Moore suggests, as if you 
          were editing a journal (like <i>The Dial</i>, which Moore edited from 
          1925 to 1929), but beware situating yourself exclusively in one or the 
          other. Olson’s field principle is a worthy one, though not new—and affiliates 
          itself too strongly (in Moore’s opinion) with the centrifugal tendency, 
          producing a poetry without form. The tendency of the trade anthology is 
          centripetal, anti-Olson, a composition by resemblance; the true anthology 
          verges on being formless—a “free verse” anthology.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
          poet or citizen leads a reader to anticipate another poet or citizen and 
          be gratified by the result? Both <i>The New American Poetry</i> and <i>Calyx: 
          30 Contemporary Australian Poets</i> organize themselves by nationality, 
          and claim to include the most exciting work by relatively young poets 
          during a particular decade (the 50s and the 90s). Riding and Graves warn 
          against this kind of specialty anthology: “A poet is not a poet because 
          of his origin, nor even a special kind of poet because he has a special 
          kind of origin. So long as the language used is more or less the same 
          there may be a greater affinity between a poet born and living in, say, 
          Dayton, Ohio, who is not wilfully Daytonian, and a poet born and living 
          in, say, Oxford, but not wilfully Oxonian, than between the former and 
          any Dayton-proud poet, or between the latter and any Oxford-proud poet.” 
          They continue: “The only excuse for a regional anthology is where the 
          language and psychology of the region selected varies very considerably 
          from those of other regions, and where an accumulation of uncollected 
          poetry exists which may be regarded as the product of the region rather 
          than of individual poets.” A few pages later: “Separate regional portfolios 
          . . . should be only allowed where the regional idiom is unmistakable, 
          and allowed for fugitive pieces only”(146-147; 152).  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>A 
          Pamphlet Against Anthologies</i> can be a witty book. They joke about 
          how excited readers are by “Mr. Dribble’s” new <i>Hundred Best Telephone 
          Numbers</i> anthology (“28443 Pobham, for instance, is a genuine discovery. 
          . . . [however] one misses the superb 00010001 Mayfair”), a variation 
          on the many Best Poem anthologies then in bookstores, and imagine the 
          marketing schemes of trade publishers who have already produced anthologies 
          of Sea Poems, Animal Poems and Flower Poems. Ah, an “Anthology of Suppressed 
          Poems” is just the trick! Then we’ll put out anthologies of Vitamin E 
          Poems, Television Poems, and Death-Ray Poems! Books of poems by single 
          authors appear even if others already exist, of course. On the other hand, 
          anthologies stake out territory, and publishers have to manufacture new 
          territories for new anthologies. Thus Vitamin E Poems. Publics for these 
          books must be both targeted <i>and</i> created.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
          funny as Riding and Graves’s jests are they malign their own comments 
          on the legitimate use of an anthology as a place for fugitive poems. They 
          talk of poems having gone astray, ignored by history, but never really 
          define what circumstances contribute to the making of the fugitive poem. 
          A “fugitive” poem seems to refer, finally, to the poem that in a dreamy 
          state of mind wanders off the publishing track, aimless because it lacks 
          that certain necessary ambition for permanence. According to these terms, 
          good editors rescue child poets; adult poets can take care of themselves.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          had been reading such stuff about anthologies when I read <i>Calyx</i>. 
          I can’t help but wonder if “Anthology of Suppressed Poems” is the subtitle 
          for all anthologies. Typically anthologized poems are advertised as having 
          been “suppressed,” even if many are well known. Anthologies of poetry 
          by women, or poets of color, and other anthologies organized not by region 
          but by identity, are sold as necessary interventions in a literary history 
          that has (actively) suppressed the work. Certainly work by young Australian 
          poets has not been actively suppressed in the US, but it wouldn’t hurt 
          if the American reader felt a little neglectful. Marjorie Perloff writes 
          in her cover blurb for <i>Calyx</i> that the poets in this “exciting new 
          anthology represent the cutting edge of current Australian practice and 
          demonstrate, in case US and UK readers still don’t know it, that theirs 
          is a poetry no one can afford to ignore.” The critic as surgeon general.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Calyx</i> 
          gathers 30 poets together, 15 men and 15 women. The poetry by women covers 
          45% of the pages, so it averages two pages less than that by men: 9 and 
          11. Because the editors have included brief biographical statements I 
          can mention also that the poets range in age from 26 to 49 (average 34). 
          (Helen Adam was the oldest at 51 in <i>The New American Poetry</i>, Olson 
          was 50; average 34, the youngest 23.) Eight of the 30 poets were born 
          or are living outside Australia. These numbers interest me because poetry 
          by women has been (actively) suppressed, historically, and <i>Calyx</i> 
          has consciously, I would guess, divvied up the space pretty much equally 
          in terms of gender. “Calyx” means something in the shape of a cup—akin 
          to the word is “chalice.” In other words, “calyx” connotes the traditional 
          symbol of the female, the bowl, which stands opposite to male symbol of 
          the staff. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">According 
          to the definition offered by Riding and Graves, this anthology is not 
          a true one—but it is not a trade one either. It is, materially, a high 
          quality soft cover book: binding, paper and presentation on the page all 
          bestow favor on the reader. Paper Bark Press, the publisher of <i>Calyx</i>, 
          appears to be a commercial press, but receives (at least for this project) 
          government funding. That the average contributor is in her early 30s immediately 
          disqualifies it, however; no true anthology contains work by contemporaries. 
          It cannot accurately be claimed that the work of a 34 year-old poet is 
          on its way to oblivion. Can it? Although there are no stray lyrics from 
          long out-of-print books, no anonymous folk ballads, many of the poems 
          are culled from limited edition chapbooks and small press productions. 
          What is on its way to oblivion in the anthology context is historical 
          difference and specificity. The 27 presses that originally made public 
          the work of these poets (only a few of which are international or theoretically 
          profitable) become one. In her summary of women Language poets and anthologies 
          in the 70s 80s and 90s, Ann Vickery has noted that an anthology renders 
          source books and their publishers indistinguishable from one another. 
          Of Susan Howe’s early books, which were published by small presses run 
          by women, Vickery says that “history is elided when her poetry is reproduced 
          in the anthology form”(148-149). The history too of the individual poets 
          gets confusing, fronted as they all are by a list of publications. Anthologies 
          more often than single author books do carry bios in a weak attempt to 
          offset their power to “cleanse” themselves of their origins (as Leah Price 
          suggests above). </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          was able to anticipate—in a variation on Moore’s terms—one poet from the 
          experience of having read another in <i>Calyx</i>, and felt gratified 
          by the result. There is form and the poets resemble one another, but are 
          not the same. Their excellencies resemble those of Bob Perelman or Barbara 
          Guest, here in the US. In <i>Calyx</i> the proposals about language, identity 
          and relations in general are constantly subtle, quietly political. Most 
          contributors are lyric poets, searching for and testing a language that 
          names things: emotions, memories, people’s relationships. It may happen 
          that an entire poem or series of poems is needed to name that thing. A 
          lyric puts into words an experience, without calling too much attention 
          to the language as language, to experience as already mediated by language. 
          For others the poem registers the experience of writing itself. The former 
          might be characterized as uncertain about certainty; the latter as certain 
          about uncertainty. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          admit that I cannot see what distinguishes the poets in <i>Calyx</i> as 
          particularly Australian—except for a tendency to read anything in English 
          or English translation, or texts in the original language, which opens 
          up a world. See “the sky slide down and shatter”(Alison Croggon, 104). 
          Australian writers see themselves objectively, globally. At an extreme, 
          perhaps, are the “Letters from Space” (my subtitle) poems in Susan Bower’s 
          “Space and Technology Series”:</font></p>
        <blockquote>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“Weren’t 
          we selected for our <i>suitability</i>,” Bower asks, acknowledging a collective 
          failure to meet the strict qualifications for the space travel that we 
          must commit to anyway. “I know the earth is round / because I see it reflected 
          in your helmet”(63). (See also MTC Cronin, “the woman feels her skull 
          / turn into the moon”(106).)</font></p>

          on the space that is beyond earth, the space through which the earth passes,

          and “Even when there is no wind there is / the solar wind, whipping our 
          bodies from the depths of space”(126). Davies reminds us of “the first 
          postulate of relativity . . . there’s no such thing as place”(128).</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
          here we are, sitting on a satellite of some kind. In their preface the 
          editors, Michael Brennan and Peter Minter—both in the anthology—say that 
          these 30 Australian poets have thought about “the demands of how to live 
          and how to write ethically and decisively,” and “of what it might mean 
          to live now in geographic and psychic locations which are both strangely 
          familiar and comfortably vertiginous”(13). The insistent question about 
          place, on the globe and in time: “Where am I?” “Where are we?” To know 
          where I am might tell me something about who I am. Epigraphs zip from 
          Susan Howe to Gérard de Nerval to Wallace Stevens to David Bowie to Emily 
          Dickinson to Courtney Love. The image of “American linguists in a helicopter, 
          dropping / ration packs of Chiclets and brand new grammar”(14) in an Adam 
          Aitken poem: should this evoke the relief supplies American workers airlift 
          into drought-stricken or war-torn lands, the absurdity of brand name nutritionless 
          food, a world learning to speak and chew American? Susan Howe is not the 
          same as Courtney Love to an Australian audience (of course), but on some 
          level references to them in the same book should suggest that the product 
          being dropped is, I think, not so much American literature but culture—or 
          literature as a cultural product, like American music, part of mass culture.

          sonnet about language use, as in “use it or lose it”) to make a suggestion: 
          the poets in <i>Calyx</i> have office keys, and work in institutional 
          rooms. I wonder whether to write is to have an office key. There’s no 
          evaluative judgement intended by these comments—they’re just a measure 
          of the distance in time from anthologies like <i>The New American Poetry</i> 
          and its anti-establishment antics. In <i>Calyx</i> there’s no list of 
          terrestrial jobs (gardener, heroin addict, cab driver, assassin, political 
          organizer, freelance expert on enlightenment) to lend credibility to the 
          idea that real poetry comes not from books but out of life experience, 
          as there were in the 1960 bios. Robin Blaser’s bio in <i>The New American 
          Poetry</i> represents the trend 40 years ago: “Born in 1925. Tied to universities 
          from 1943-59: Northwestern, College of Idaho, Berkeley, California as 
          a student; Harvard as a librarian from 1955-1959. Now free and hoping 
          to remain that way. But it’s doubtful. Money!” Whereas the emphasis then 
          was on what they were doing, and where they were not (the university), 
          now the emphasis lands in general on publications and affiliation, if 
          any, with a university-type structure. The repressed element (the university) 
          then was an uncanny one—destined to return, for Blaser (who became an 
          English professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada) and 
          for the generations since. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          poets in <i>Calyx</i> do share with the (temporarily) untied poets of 
          the early 60s an intention to publish in something other than an anthology 
          context. Zan Ross states in her bio that “She has appeared in all the 
          usual journals, but prefers zines because they allow her more opportunity 
          to experiment”(326). While I question the logic of this statement (zines 
          no doubt publish poetry that a larger more commercial publishing venue 
          would not, but zines also publish entirely derivative efforts; there’s 
          no necessary correlation between experimental writing and publisher’s 
          budget), I agree that what a person writes will be determined by the venue. 
          (Should I assume, then, that this is Ross’s least experimental work here, 
          in a book—in an anthology?) </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          confess a certain suspiciousness of writers who claim that poetry today 
          is outside the corporate institution, the writing of it contiguous with 
          their life as freelance counter-culture expert—it was okay then (1960), 
          but naive now (2000). I admit as well that I work and live in one myself, 
          and the windows on my building might be mirrors. But writers need to be 
          in business, at least in the US, to get teeth cleaned or have a tumor 
          removed; they have been in business for some time now. Consider Anthony 
          Trollope (an extreme example no doubt), who in his posthumously published 
          <i>Autobiography</i> (1883) declared “Brains that are unbought will never 
          serve the public much”(72). Trollope mocks the affected virtue of writers 
          who claim to be above the interest in pecuniary reward. “I confess,” he 
          says, “that my first object in taking to literature as a profession was 
          that which is common to the barrister when he goes to the bar, and to 
          the baker when he sets up his oven. I wished to make an income on which 
          I and those belonging to me might live in comfort”(72-73). He believes 
          also that writers should serve the public, not be hostile to its desires. 
          Trollope’s theory (as he calls it) that writers are in a profession like 
          bakers or shoemakers and should produce saleable work is an offensive 
          one, he assumes, to writers. According to his theory, however, a writer 
          may not have to sell his brain if he cares nothing for the public. According 
          to the observation put forward (above) by Riding and Graves—that a book 
          of poetry is always published at a loss—poets despise money. (“It is a 
          mistake to suppose that a man is a better man because he despises money,” 
          says Trollope.) Perhaps poets despise the public too, and write for a 
          private audience. Poets have thought kindly of themselves: “Because I 
          make no money as a poet,” the logic goes, “I must be writing for virtuous 
          reasons.” What of anthology-poets?</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          editors of <i>Calyx</i> mention that these are all “poets who started 
          publishing <i>widely</i> in the 1990s”(12, my emphasis). The anthology 
          makes this somewhat exaggerated claim much more of a reality: though not 
          “fugitive,” many of these poets are likely unknown to readers in Australia, 
          certainly elsewhere. To the extent that it follows anthologies like <i>The 
          New American Poetry</i>, this new anthology has produced the poetry. But 
          <i>Calyx</i> is an anthology of poets most of whom are not anthology-poets; 
          the poetry has truly produced the anthology, which will create a new public. 
          True anthologies want to participate in the construction of the contemporary 
          historical moment, become an event. Ideally a poet in <i>Calyx</i> would 
          feel, thinking of Fagan’s poem, “poet to poet / we collide.” Knowing that 
          she has stepped into the location of the anthology, the individual poet 
          can change it or have it happen to her. To intervene in history an anthology 
          must unify for strength, however, collapsing the histories of its contributors 
          in a centripetal movement—authors become a composite author. The vista 
          (anthology) would reinterpret them. An anthology is in business and flattens 
          the distinction between poets, and <i>Calyx</i> is no exception. But again 
          and again, I wished I had more from the poet, the books that sacrificed 
          themselves for the anthology. </font></p>

          bills, these days, and only a few ducks will appear, hungry and grateful; 
          maybe this poet is on the edge of a crater somewhere. But others are there 
          with her, at least. “An eagle by the cliff edge assumes the character 
          of ‘missing,’ intersects waves or recollects flesh. Fish. At this edge.
