        Henry Lepus (the last Latin for hare)—rabbit!: if not more-travelled than 
        the Easter Bunny then perhaps more interestingly-travelled; seer of sights 
        at least as psychedelic as those seen by the late white rabbit who evaded 
        Alice; and owner of a singularly flyless nose though his mind has been 
        known to do a few flips and flops when confronted with the living, eating 
        and breeding (not to mention thinking and writing!) habits of that very 
        infamous two-legged animal—human!</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter 
        wonders, for example, “WHY    humans    like humans best?,” without forgetting, 
        I am sure, that not only do humans like humans best but also hate humans 
        most. (And in fact their ‘hate’ for other species is probably confined 
        to phobia scenarios and even then hate is hardly the right word: a general 
        ‘disregard’ for other animals might be the agreed upon norm.)</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">J.S. 
        Harry biographs P.H. Lepus in her earlier book<i>, The Life on Water and 
        The Life Beneath</i>, where ten poems about him exist: “named by his mother, 
        an extremely well-read and well-educated rabbit of Creole ancestry, after 
        a character in a book of old Creole folk tales, <i>L’Histoire de Pierre 
        Henri Lepus </i>[rhymes with <i>chou</i>],” he is, however, a British 
        rabbit—growing up in the English countryside of the early twentieth century—with 
        a penchant for wandering and wondering.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
        if the world has not been his oyster it has at least provided the odd 
        weed and, in happier moments, a stout-hearted lettuce. From the Australian 
        Poets’ Union Party of 2003 (already funny, if you’re Australian)—where 
        Hank Lazer has heard they’re getting a web site and has dropped in for 
        the views—to negotiating the slippery slopes of a questionable Antarctica 
        with an anguished Wittgenstein; from a rough “rescue” in Calcutta by Mother 
        Teresa (she grabs him by the ears!) to “Value-Judgement” Land where the 
        sign reads:</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">from 
        a chat with Altieri (“says Altieri, / “I want to see your / ‘means of 
        production’—” / Peter / is not producing / at the moment &amp; doubts 
        / whether Altieri could see / how he <i>did</i> it were he to hop…/ either 
        if he <i>were</i> producing PELLETS FOR CRITICS then…/ or, if he were 
        not”) at the Poets’ Union 1998 Moon Viewing Party to hiding from Chairman 
        Miaow (“He is CAT who is white”) under the rose bushes (where at that 
        moment Peter “would rather live by guile / than die by art”), this rabbit 
        gets around and is “provoked,” as Harry so undelicately puts it, into 
        using his mind.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What’s 
        the provocation? Like Brer Rabbit, Peter has his own personal tar-baby 
        which attracts him. Unlike Brer Rabbit’s tar-baby, which fascinates and 
        entraps with its silence, Peter’s tar-baby is “knowledge”—given human 
        and idiosyncratic form in the tar-babies of philosophy and literary criticism: 
        the aforementioned Wittgenstein, Lazer and Altieri, and, among others 
        (though theories often make appearances without names), Bertrand Russell, 
        Derrida and Marx. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter’s 
        desire is not simply to make these tar-babies talk, but to mull over in 
        a kind of by-the-by way (as, of course, a rabbit would do when confronted 
        by human “genius” and “idiocy”) not simply <i>what</i> they say, but the 
        how and why of it. Epistemology and methodology, our <i>hows</i> and <i>ways</i> 
        of knowing, cop a hilarious gentle savage guileless savant no-holds-barred 
        beating at his travelling rabbit paws. Two beautiful examples, first, 
        from “At the Poets’ Union Party, June 31<sup>st</sup>, 2003”:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter 
          thinks, if Altieri came back,<br>
          he could offer him a cold &amp; frosty [for the not-Australians, a can 
          of beer!]<br>
          &amp; Altieri could go and see<br>
          how THEY get produced<br>
          out of the refrigerator<br>
          which to Peter<br>
          is something of a miracle,<br>
          though disappointing—<br>
          It doesn’t have any of <i>his</i> food<br>
          but only<br>
          the cold &amp; frosties<br>
          which he’s heard said<br>
          are the means<br>
          by which<br>
          poems<br>
          are produced.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Could 
          the refrigerator door<br>

          come swinging out of it<br>
          while Peter’s watching.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter 
        might be a <i>naif</i>, as he is described by David Brooks in the Foreword 
        to the second reprint of <i>Sun Shadow, Moon Shadow</i>, but unlike Ms 
        Potter’s Peter Rabbit this little hopper is no household pet. Indeed, 
        his mind is delightfully untamed as evidenced by Brooks’ qualification 
        of Peter as a “truly intelligent naif”: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>clear-minded and more or less without prejudice, 
          with a talent for finding the kind of simple, obvious question that 
          might take him, if he cared to follow it, straight to the heart of the 
          matter. In another incarnation, I’m sure, he was the boy who inadvertently 
          forced his townspeople to admit that their Emperor was wearing no clothes.</span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Consider, 
        if you will, Harry’s handing along to us in her “A Preface?” Peter’s view 
        on prefaces (perhaps he met Akhmatova and approved her use of “Instead 
        of a…”) of which he is not fond:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>he says that though they are the ‘face’ you see before 
          the ‘face’ of the other writing, he feels they should more properly

          writing.</span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
        what about his alarming ability to put his paw <i>on it</i>, viz., Peter 
        ‘I’dentifies the ‘I’ness of humans as their distinguishing mark:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>They

          But you can’t see it properly<br>
          not all of it. Not like you can see<br>
          ears or whiskers,<br>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“This 
        is what Peter tells the flowerbed rabbit/who lives deep in dark leaves/that

        dark-fringed Disney-bunny-girl eyes of the rabbit Thumper fell in love 
        with when all the boy animals became “twitterpated” in Bambi. Indeed, 
        the flowerbed rabbit cannot read and is baffled by the I’s Peter forms 
        from twigs on the ground.  And when he moves on from “I” to “die” she 
        doesn’t know what that is either because “It’s a word…like I is: nobody 
        knows what it’s like inside it.” Peter explains and explains—when the 
        girl rabbit, like Thumper, would probably think a skunk a flower—until 
        getting nowhere realizes</font></p>

          disappearing<br>

      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Well, 
        even if Peter does occasionally get caught up in the web of human theorizing—he 
        is no Peter Cottontail, hopping down the bunny trail!  I’ll follow Harry 
        any day into her flowers. Hope to see you there (we can split our sides 
        together reading these gorgeous poems and then have a good cry about the 
        state of being human and not rabbit—and I’m not talking Bugs Bunny!).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Note 
        from the bushes: Harry’s <i>Sun Shadow, Moon Shadow</i> was shortlisted 
        for the <i>Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry</i> 2001 (New South Wales 
        Premier’s Literary Awards). Unfortunately <i>The Life on Water and The 
        Life Beneath</i> is out of print. Hopefully more Lepus poems will appear 
        and perhaps one day the tales will be collected as poems sometimes are 
        (though I’d be titillated to know P.H. Lepus’ views on this particular 
        human—and poets are human!—habit). </font></p>
