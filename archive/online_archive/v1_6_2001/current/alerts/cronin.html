          Henry Lepus (the last Latin for hare)—rabbit!: if not more-travelled than 
          the Easter Bunny then perhaps more interestingly-travelled; seer of sights 
          at least as psychedelic as those seen by the late white rabbit who evaded 
          Alice; and owner of a singularly flyless nose though his mind has been 
          known to do a few flips and flops when confronted with the living, eating 
          and breeding (not to mention thinking and writing!) habits of that very 
          infamous two-legged animal—human!</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter 
          wonders, for example, “WHY    humans    like humans best?,” without forgetting, 
          I am sure, that not only do humans like humans best but also hate humans 
          most. (And in fact their ‘hate’ for other species is probably confined 
          to phobia scenarios and even then hate is hardly the right word: a general 
          ‘disregard’ for other animals might be the agreed upon norm.)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">J.S. 
          Harry biographs P.H. Lepus in her earlier book<i>, The Life on Water and 
          The Life Beneath</i>, where ten poems about him exist: “named by his mother, 
          an extremely well-read and well-educated rabbit of Creole ancestry, after 
          a character in a book of old Creole folk tales, <i>L’Histoire de Pierre 
          Henri Lepus </i>[rhymes with <i>chou</i>],” he is, however, a British 
          rabbit—growing up in the English countryside of the early twentieth century—with 
          a penchant for wandering and wondering.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          if the world has not been his oyster it has at least provided the odd 
          weed and, in happier moments, a stout-hearted lettuce. From the Australian 
          Poets’ Union Party of 2003 (already funny, if you’re Australian)—where 
          Hank Lazer has heard they’re getting a web site and has dropped in for 
          the views—to negotiating the slippery slopes of a questionable Antarctica 
          with an anguished Wittgenstein; from a rough “rescue” in Calcutta by Mother 
          Teresa (she grabs him by the ears!) to “Value-Judgement” Land where the 
          sign reads:</font></p>

        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">from 
          a chat with Altieri (“says Altieri, / “I want to see your / ‘means of 
          production’—” / Peter / is not producing / at the moment &amp; doubts 
          / whether Altieri could see / how he <i>did</i> it were he to hop…/ either 
          if he <i>were</i> producing PELLETS FOR CRITICS then…/ or, if he were 
          not”) at the Poets’ Union 1998 Moon Viewing Party to hiding from Chairman 
          Miaow (“He is CAT who is white”) under the rose bushes (where at that 
          moment Peter “would rather live by guile / than die by art”), this rabbit 
          gets around and is “provoked,” as Harry so undelicately puts it, into 
          using his mind.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What’s 
          the provocation? Like Brer Rabbit, Peter has his own personal tar-baby 
          which attracts him. Unlike Brer Rabbit’s tar-baby, which fascinates and 
          entraps with its silence, Peter’s tar-baby is “knowledge”—given human 
          and idiosyncratic form in the tar-babies of philosophy and literary criticism: 
          the aforementioned Wittgenstein, Lazer and Altieri, and, among others 
          (though theories often make appearances without names), Bertrand Russell, 
          Derrida and Marx. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter’s 
          desire is not simply to make these tar-babies talk, but to mull over in 
          a kind of by-the-by way (as, of course, a rabbit would do when confronted 
          by human “genius” and “idiocy”) not simply <i>what</i> they say, but the 
          how and why of it. Epistemology and methodology, our <i>hows</i> and <i>ways</i> 
          of knowing, cop a hilarious gentle savage guileless savant no-holds-barred 
          beating at his travelling rabbit paws. Two beautiful examples, first, 
          from “At the Poets’ Union Party, June 31<sup>st</sup>, 2003”:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Peter

            of beer!]<br>
            &amp; Altieri could go and see<br>
            how THEY get produced<br>
            out of the refrigerator<br>
            which to Peter<br>
            is something of a miracle,<br>
            though disappointing—<br>
            It doesn’t have any of <i>his</i> food<br>
            but only<br>
            the cold &amp; frosties<br>
            which he’s heard said<br>
            are the means<br>
            by which<br>
            poems<br>
            are produced.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Could 
            the refrigerator door<br>

          of a…”) of which he is not fond:</font></p>
        <blockquote>

          dark-fringed Disney-bunny-girl eyes of the rabbit Thumper fell in love 
          with when all the boy animals became “twitterpated” in Bambi. Indeed, 
          the flowerbed rabbit cannot read and is baffled by the I’s Peter forms 
          from twigs on the ground.  And when he moves on from “I” to “die” she 
          doesn’t know what that is either because “It’s a word…like I is: nobody 
          knows what it’s like inside it.” Peter explains and explains—when the 
          girl rabbit, like Thumper, would probably think a skunk a flower—until 
          getting nowhere realizes</font></p>

          Premier’s Literary Awards). Unfortunately <i>The Life on Water and The 
          Life Beneath</i> is out of print. Hopefully more Lepus poems will appear 
          and perhaps one day the tales will be collected as poems sometimes are
