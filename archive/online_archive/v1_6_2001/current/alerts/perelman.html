          schematic account: two hundred years ago, as poetry and painting were 
          being troubled, undercut, and radically displaced by the machine, the 
          artist vowed not to cease from mental fight until the dark Satanic mills 
          would be converted into a rural Jerusalem. A century later, it was the 
          Romantic war cries themselves that were converted, into Modernist assertions 
          of solidarity such as Williams’s “A poem is a small (or large) machine 
          made of words.” In the third stage, our present, Modernist solidarity 
          with the machine has been superseded by Postmodern merger: a Damien Hirst 
          sectioned cow in plexiglass, say; a computer-generated procedural text. 
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It’s 
          hard to deny the general force of this common narrative. But <i>Pianola</i>, 
          a small, deft collaboration between painter Jo Milne and her brother, 
          poet Drew Milne, published by rem press in an edition of 250 copies, demonstrates 
          the tenacity of an opposed narrative, where art’s beleaguered position 
          in the machine world has not changed that much in two hundred years. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
          it’s clear that art has long embraced the machine, the relationship remains 
          unreciprocated. There’s all too much evidence in support of this, of the 
          most obvious sort. Machines are ubiquitous and are crucial at all points 
          in everybody’s lives; art subsists in niches and micro-niches. Machines 
          are profoundly effective at what they do; the effects of art are so complexly 
          mediated that they are often nearly ineffable for those who care and are 
          quite invisible to the many who don’t. Machines are thoughtless, banal, 
          yet in the accuracy and intricacy of their construction they make artistic 
          claims like</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Zukofsky’s 
          “If number, measure and weighing / Be taken away from any art, / That 
          which remains will not be much” seem strained. Machines routinely perform 
          superhuman operations; all the arts are lodged inescapably within the 
          narrow spectra of sensory rhetorics.                                              
          </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Viewed 
          and read within the coherence provided by their own spheres, Jo Milne’s 
          paintings are beautifully elegant and Drew Milne’s poems accompany them 
          in tight, energetic, tonally variegated grids. The layout of the book 
          stages the dialog of word and image in a most restrained fashion, ministering 
          to focused reception. But when this calm aesthetic autonomy is set against 
          the larger horizon of the machine world, <i>Pianola</i> allows us to detect 
          the old unresolved displacements that continue to trouble the foundation 
          of art practices.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          grand piano was a prime arena for the display of ego and genius in the 
          19th Century; and music scores ministered to this aura. A Liszt could 
          play things no one else could, and the scores of his music displayed the 
          mysterious hieroglyphs of his prowess. Or a Rubenstein could interpret 
          Chopin with unmatched fire and delicacy; the score would be incapable 
          of revealing how he did it. The pianola was a doppelganger of this. Mostly, 
          it was a large-scale music-box. A note from the Pianola Institute confirms 
          the unsurprising fact that “The vast majority of music rolls for the normal 
          pianola were not recorded at a keyboard, but simply perforated by a technician 
          after being marked up in pencil with reference to the original sheet music. 
          Thus there are no changes of tempi, rubato or phrasing on normal pianola 
          rolls, and instead the operator is provided with a tempo control, which 
          must be used to create musical performances.” Here was the site, not even 
          of the mechanical reproduction of the work of art, but of mechanical production 
          of entertainment. But I’m fairly sure that music rolls were also made, 
          less frequently, from the performances of concert pianists. In such cases, 
          the ineffability of master performance could be captured by the punched-out 
          rectangles of the rolls. Or, in a later development exploited by a contemporary 
          composers like Conlon Nancarrow, music of a speed and complexity quite 
          beyond any concert pianist’s abilities could be punched onto a roll. Thus 
          the pianola was a machine that could bring music down to a mechanical 
          level, that could reproduce human uniqueness, and that could outstrip 
          human virtuosity. In each case, the human senses are confronted by mechanical 
          address. The Milnes’ relation to this is complex, but before discussing 
          it, I’d like to sample the machine/art conflict in the design of the physical 
          chapbook. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Pianola</i> 
          displays the delicately industrial chic of rem press productions. It’s 
          about 8 inches square, with black cardboard covers displaying no print, 
          front or back. So it’s hard to tell if, when you open it, the pages will 
          be upside down or not. Such an object could possibly be some kind of anonymous 
          manual, but the lack of print suggests much more strongly that it’s an 
          art object, addressing no public marketplace, circulating via pre-arranged 
          channels. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          binding suggests the opposite. The spine of small silver hoops is a well-made 
          version of the cheap spiral bindings used in school notebooks. Such bindings 
          make the manufacture of the object inescapable; and the signal emphatically 
          that the pages they collect will be given over to routine, not ambition. 
          A normally bound book proclaims its importance via a number of interlocking 
          unities: title, author, genre, cover design. These tend to mask any awareness 
          that the object you hold is the spawn of a factory. A spiral binding makes 
          this fact inescapable, and it suggests only temporary utility: the pages 
          are easy to tear out.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          final player in the rem press format drama is a small silver dot, handpainted 
          in the lower right corners of the front and back covers. Looking very 
          closely in good light, you can see that the dot lies between the words 
          “rem” and “press” which are embossed to just the slightest degree on the 
          black cardboard. Here, in plangent understatement, single time after single 
          time, the hand of the artisan-artist publisher has registered its tiny 
          silver protest against the crude iteration of mechanical reproduction. 
          (Although it has to be a good thing for the dot-painter that there were 
          only 250 copies.)</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Once 
          the front cover is opened, <i>Pianola</i> shows itself to consist of 9 
          color plates and 9 poems. Each item occupies the right page of a spread, 
          so that only one plate or one poem can be seen at a time. The final printed 
          page informs us that the plates are “photographic details…reproduced from 
          Jo Milne’s series of Pianola paintings. These details were developed, 
          along with Drew Milne’s poems, from scrolls for mechanical piano.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          don’t know what “developed” means, either for the visuals or the poems. 
          But in neither case does it seem to have a mechanical procedure. Jo Milne’s 
          paintings, at least as they are relayed via the photographs, seem to sample, 
          dramatize, aestheticize the mechanical patterns of the punched-out holes 
          in the rolls. On some pages it seems as if the lens was quite close up 
          to the canvas; on others it seems farther back. But her deft handling 
          of paint is clear, and a strong sense of overall composition comes through 
          as well. The paintings are focused on the surface, where patterns developed 
          from the original punched-out ‘notes’ float above a distant matte layer, 
          and sometimes above a muted mid-layer of notes. A few plates stage this 
          surface/depth dialog much more equivocally; but most plates display vivid 
          patterns of dashes of varying sizes, with the paint at times piled into 
          thick impasto, above the indistinct texture of the lower layer(s). The 
          opening plate uses a light silver that is rather close to the silver dots 
          of the cover; other plates use a quite bright yellow, or white. The color, 
          texture, and animation of the series of horizontal, or pyramidal, or ascending 
          stairstep dashes suggests melody, aria, the grain of a special voice, 
          sentence, or message.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’m 
          reminded of a photograph by British artist Cornelia Parker which presents 
          a series of thick white powdery dashes trailing across an indistinct background. 
          The referent is mysterious though the evocativeness of the photo demands 
          an answer. Are these stars, microscopic marine life, molecular somethings-or-other? 
          What we see turns out to a micro-photograph from the blackboard Einstein 
          used in his last public lecture. As with Jo Milne’s paintings, the medium 
          presents us with a mystery whose surface is an aesthetically satisfying 
          picture of code. Once the decoding is done we are in very mediated touch 
          with a mystery of high value. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like 
          I say, <i>Pianola</i> provides only identically-sized plates of photographic 
          “details” of the paintings. The overall size and shape of the paintings 
          would fundamentally alter their import. Are they squarish rectangles, 
          like the plates? Or are they longer horizontals, like scrolls? Is each 
          canvas an all-over pattern, as the plates suggest? Seeing the whole series 
          of paintings might easily change my sense of lyrical aesthetic celebration 
          of machine codes; perhaps there would be more irony directed against the 
          pianola, more despair at the mechanical patterns.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Such 
          format questions don’t come up with Drew Milne’s poems, which the pages 
          present in their entirety. The first poem:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">trill 
            to this            its bleeding obvious<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upside yon sauntering logarithm<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that trots 
            but to mortify each still<br>
            simple but bristle                     such dogchat<br>

            this        its serene and blooming kisser   </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span>        
          </span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
          in the paintings, I can’t determine how the poems were developed from 
          piano rolls. I do get a sense of consistent gesturing toward procedural 
          regularities, some of which I can specify. Each poem is of the same shape: 
          twelve lines, mostly broken in two, with one to three unbroken lines per 
          poem. There’s some enjambment, but the staccato phrase is the primary 
          mode. Musical terms occur in each poem, “trill,” “fortissimo” here; elsewhere, 
          “viol of silence turn larkness visible”; “contrapuntal largesse,” etc. 
          Most of the poems contain rhyming phrases suggesting popular titles like 
          “Tutti Frutti” or “Scrapple from the Apple”: i.e., “so stoops the oops”; 
          “lush dippy lippy”; “sheds loony toons”; “this itty bitty / oh so gawking 
          skip”; “all hands on hoity toity     do the okey / dokey continental.” 
          The kind of detournement of high art that makes the Miltonic “darkness 
          visible” into “larkness visible” occurs throughout: “upside yon sauntering 
          logarithm” takes the Elizabethan diction of “yon sauntering” and surrounds 
          it with clashing contemporary tones, attaching the scientific “logarithm” 
          to the end and, to the beginning, “upside,” which I hear as Black street-talk: 
          “upside” as in “upside yo head.” “In slash funky” from the previous lines 
          reinforces this. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It’s 
          an overdetermined question whether such reference translates to opposition, 
          solidarity, or union with the ‘pianola,’ i.e., with the totality of contemporary 
          cultural machines. Attitude is sharply available at all points, but do 
          the specificities add up in a particular direction? Contradiction sounds 
          most loudly. To my ear the opening phrase, “Trill to this,” urges us toward 
          aesthetic ecstasy (thrill to this); but the second phrase deflates this 
          with class hostility: “its bleeding obvious.” </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Do 
          these poems manifest an overall attitude to their assigned role as art 
          in the age of the pianola, the juke box, Napster? And if they do, how 
          different is it from that of the High Modernists? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Pound 
          and Eliot registered the class threat of the machine clearly. Behind the 
          machine, the masses of “Rude Mechanicals” were no longer arranging themselves 
          into the comedy of Bottom’s Pyramus and Thisby. Machine-made art could 
          only produce mechanical, degraded results: “The pianola ‘replaces’ / Sappho’s 
          barbitos”—there may be many strata of irony in “Hugh Selwyn Mauberley,” 
          but it’s hard to escape the typical starkness of the Poundian syllogism: 
          Sappho, good: pianola, bad.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          pianola makes a contemporaneous appearance in <i>The Waste Lan</i>d: “O 
          O O O that Shakespeherian Rag.” If the four “O”s, the vulgarised pronunciation, 
          and the impoverishment associated with “rag” didn’t underline the negativity 
          sufficiently, then the surrounding lines should clinch the case: </font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do<br>
            “You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember<br>

            So intelligent<br>
            “What shall I do now? What shall I do?”</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          pianola is a vivid symptom of cultural decay here. Like Frankenstein’s 
          monster, it voids foundational aesthetic distinctions. Does the pianola 
          know anything, remember anything? Is it alive or not? And it’s all too 
          democratic, dragging the Bard down to the level of the most jejune rhyming. 
          Given these grim facts: what shall the artist do now? </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eliot—early 
          Eliot at any rate—is always more open to contradiction than Pound. Thus 
          it’s possible to detect a slight hint that our non-functioning Modernist 
          couple here might do better to go out and dance to the Shakespeherian 
          Rag, even if it did emanate from rectangular holes punched into scrolls 
          by uninspired technicians.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Drew 
          Milne eschews Eliot’s use of narrative; in the <i>Pianola</i> poems, cultural 
          conflicts occur between and within collaged phrases. So the surface and 
          the overall shape is of course quite different <i>from The Waste Land</i>. 
          But I read a similar unease at the artist’s position in the machine world, 
          resulting in distaste, careful distancing, longing—though the proportions 
          are different for in Milne than for Eliot. Here is the final poem in the 
          sequence: </font></p>

          are moments here—fewer than in some of the other poems—where I can read 
          assertions of artistic power: “we are / an invincible brogue”; “let rip” 
          though both are undercut within the phrase. Is Adorno’s negative aesthetics 
          the only safe retreat for artists, “scions of negativity” surrounded by 
          the “rich bitters of gimme”? I don’t know if in the final phrase, “and 
          a not so bouncy ball,” Milne was imagining the bouncing dot that used 
          to bounce over the words to sing-along texts in old pedestrian animations. 
          If so, it’s a nicely pessimistic emblem of the mechanized verbal regimes 
          that confront the poet. But whether that particular reading is accurate 
          or not, the overall sense of the phrase-conflicts in the poems seems summed 
          up by the first line above: “the shot put data boys sure do prod.” They’re 
          strong brutes, those data boys, and to their prodding the artist answers—what?</font></p>
