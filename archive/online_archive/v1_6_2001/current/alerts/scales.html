        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“The 
          Scales Project,” also called “Wasted” and “Flattened,” began to take form 
          one day when I dismantled a bathroom scale and found it devoid of the 
          omnipresent voice I had projected onto it. I subsequently sent an email 
          to students and faculty on three college campuses inviting them to donate 
          bathroom scales for a performance piece during which the scales would 
          be flattened with a steamroller. Additionally, I asked for volunteers 
          to be interviewed in response to questions such as “If your bathroom scale 
          could say anything in the world to you, what would it say?” Comments from 
          those interviews include “It wouldn’t be a number. It would be a measure 
          of how beautiful, how much I have inside of me.” One woman internalized 
          the voice of the male teacher in “The Dead Poets Society” and wished her 
          scale would say “Carpe Diem…seize the day boys! Seize the day!” A third 
          interviewee commented: “If the enemy has an outpost in our heads, then 
          maybe the scale is the outpost.”</font></p>

          Beffel studied Fine Arts at the University of Michigan where she received 
          her BFA and at the University of Iowa where she received her MA and MFA. 
          She participated in the Whitney Independent Studio Program in 1999-2000 
          and is currently an Assistant Professor of Art at Syracuse University.

          explores ideas of personal and social equilibrium through interactive 
          and collaborative projects that inhabit quotidian and institutional spaces. 
          Through the juxtaposition of physically altered, mundane objects and narratives 
          gathered from the media, personal conversations, and documentary interviews, 
          Beffel points to power relations that inform human existence at minute 
          and gigantic scales. She invites us to examine and question the roles 
          we play within hierarchies and how these roles manifest themselves in 
          our daily gestures of work, care, and consumption.</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Beffel’s 
          work has been shown extensively in the United States and she is the recipient 
          of numerous grants, residencies and awards. She has exhibited in New York 
          at the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Open Studio and the Pratt Institute 
          of Fine Arts. Her work has also been exhibited recently at the Maryland 
          Institute of Art in Baltimore.</font></p>
