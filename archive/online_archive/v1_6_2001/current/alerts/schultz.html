        Lauterbach is that contemporary anomaly, the pure lyric poet.  Her work, 
        from its beginning to the end that this book marks, uses sound as a springboard 
        to investigations more suggestive than concrete, more ethereal than earthy, 
        more sung than said.  I <i>should</i> say this is a characteristic of 
        her work from its end to its beginning, as the <i>Selected Poems</i> prints 
        her most recent work first, drawing out one of the many questions raised 
        by the title, <i>If in Time</i>.  In this instance, the “if” represents 
        the conventional lyrical impulse to move out of, and not into, time.  
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or 
        does it?  One of the more fascinating investigations of the lyric I’ve 
        read in recent years, Daniel Tiffany’s <i>Toy Medium</i>, leads me to 
        think otherwise.  Tiffany turns the conventional notion of lyric as the 
        vehicle for a move out of time on its metaphorical (or is it literal?) 
        head.  In a book that is more science history than literary criticism 
        but which combines the two provocatively, Tiffany argues that “poetry 
        and atomic physics often converge, especially in the context of modernism 
        [he further claims the lyric is inherently modern], in their <i>representations</i> 
        of material substance and the nature of corporeality”(287).  The lyric, 
        Tiffany asserts, is not about a <i>lack</i> of materiality; it is itself 
        material.  Whatever <i>ifs</i> it suggests about the existence of that 
        world, it shares with quantum physics.  The better to get at the stories 
        we tell ourselves about matter, Tiffany writes the history of materialism, 
        relating recent arguments over pictorial representations of the invisible 
        world to earlier scientific and philosophical uses of automata, dolls 
        and toys.  What this means to Tiffany is that “lyric poetry emerges not 
        merely as the object of literary criticism but as a <i>model</i> of materialist 
        criticism in its most searching and original form.”  He continues:  “Lyric 
        poetry, according to Giorgio Agamben, is the very model of ‘science without 
        object,’ which we must now equate with materialist or historical criticism 
        in its most authentic—that is to say, philosophical—mode”(290).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lauterbach 
        has always represented herself as a thinker caught between the poles of 
        material and immaterial substance.  In “Saint Lucia,” from her 1987 collection, 
        <i>Before Recollection</i>, she writes: “I’m between Beckett and Bishop, 
        / the one entirely in, the other there / civilizing Brazil, clarity to 
        clarity”(206).  In a walk in Gramercy Park, recorded in her first volume, 
        <i>Many Times, But Then</i> (1979), she notes that, “What we perceive 
        / is part dream, part deceit; what we want / touches knowledge,” and further, 
        that she took her walk “towards a cadence / of real images: the gate, 
        the grass, the lock”(230).  Lest these “real images” be possessed of too 
        much material substance, however, she concludes the poem in a kind of 
        x-ray vision that Tiffany writes about at length: “There was a sense that 
        things are lit / from within, of high, shut carriages and women in hats.”  
        This conclusion takes us back in time—in a trajectory resembling that 
        of her new book—and into a kind of Victorian phantasmagoria.  It also 
        renders the “real,” the substantive, as an image that is half-substance, 
        half-light.  Her walk gets her to the substance of things—the atomic level—where 
        substance is seen to have very little, if any substance.  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        internal debate over what one might call “the reality of the real” informs 
        all Lauterbach’s work, including her interest in the moments either “before 
        recollection” or after it, when “things” are forgotten (she has a fine 
        essay on forgetting in a collection edited by James McCorkle).  The world 
        Lauterbach describes is not an easy one to live in, or on; we abide on 
        in only through an act of trust; in “Still,” she writes</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chance 
          is a variant<br>
          <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>of change, the weather changing, chancy<br>
          but destined. Our trust is that we, too, are<br>
          forms attached to content, content to meanings<br>
          aroused. It is our custom to bring things about.(204)</span></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        possible blur or shift in the meaning of the word(s) “content” in the 
        next-to-last line quoted here denotes the variants of “chance” and “change,” 
        two words that are at once  the same, and not quite.  “Things” that are 
        “brought about” are often, of course, not things at all, but thoughts, 
        feelings, an internal life whose world is represented through material 
        metaphor.    </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        word “aroused,” found in the last line I quoted from “Still,” is important 
        to Lauterbach, as is the fact of <i>desire</i> (not so much as a feeling 
        but as a state in which one lives on the earth, a state like trust that 
        holds things together, however tentatively).  The poet is one who desires—and 
        does not desire—to sing, but whose volition is less than complete.  The 
        poet sees herself as a kind of mannequin, or doll, or like the follower 
        of Stevens’s woman on the shore who sang the world into being (although 
        Lauterbach sees this singer as less powerful than Stevens did).  In a 
        passage from “After the Storm” that fits Tiffany’s argument about dolls 
        (and the weather, which is and is not material), she writes:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her trouble 
          is the trouble of fiction and dolls;<br>
          She is authored by another, one who says<br>
          <i>Sing! Do not sing!</i> And does not watch<br>
          As the weed fires along the meadow<br>
          And does not see the fog roll over her toward us. (194)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        singer must, then, be blind because she is “authored by another,” is as 
        much formed by the world as she is its creator.  She cannot be the origin 
        of the world’s substance, or its thought, because she is part of that 
        substance.  In many ways, this may be the last station on the transcendentalist 
        cross, this recognition that the “transparent eyeball” doesn’t so much 
        carry you above and beyond the Common, but also transfixes and transforms 
        you, the subject/author of the poem.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Where 
        Lauterbach’s early work shows her grappling with what we might call the 
        Beckett/Bishop conundrum in a space that is almost purely literary, her 
        later work testifies to an increasingly conscious knowledge of the tradition 
        within which she works.  The first headnote from <i>On a Stair</i> (1996), 
        for example, is from the philosopher, Giorgio Agamben, who figures so 
        prominently in Tiffany’s narrative about the blurring of lyrical and physical 
        readings of the world.  She quotes Agamben as follows: <i>“The question 
        ‘where is the thing?’ is inseparable from the question ‘where is the human?’  
        Like the fetish, like the toy, things are not properly anywhere, because 
        their place is found on this side of objects and beyond the human in a 
        zone that is no longer objective or subjective, neither personal nor impersonal, 
        neither material nor immaterial, but where we find ourselves suddenly 
        facing these apparently simple unknowns: the human, the thing </i>(45)<i>.  
        </i>Her short sequence, “On,” made up of three poems parenthetically subtitled 
        <i>Word</i>, <i>Thing</i>, and <i>Dream</i>, investigates the chanciness 
        and changeability of the world based on words we use to describe it. <i>“Are 
        we mere vocabularies?</i>” she asks, in the first, suggesting that we 
        are: “Words turn on the mischief of their telling,” as she writes in the 
        last line, but so does our perception of the world.  The second poem, 
        while it purports to be about the <i>thing</i>, also hangs on the word 
        more than world: “voice thread thru stone, between the <i>s</i> and the 
        <i>t</i> and the <i>one</i>,” where our verbal icon, “stone,” opens to 
        let in the voice through its pores.  And again, in the <i>Dream</i> section, 
        the poem ends with an apostrophe (which gives life to inanimate objects), 
        “o thing, you cannot cradle this relic / as it travels thru what is”(50).  
        These three poems resemble earlier poems in their structure on the page, 
        their quick lyric investigation of a problem not to be solved but to be 
        presented beautifully, like a proof (except that it is not one).  Elsewhere 
        in this book, however, Lauterbach discovers herself as a more “experimental” 
        writer; her poems wander across the page, they grow longer, and they are, 
        to this reader at least, more opaque, considerably more private than the 
        earlier poems.  Where I could read the philosophical issues <i>in</i> 
        the early poems, it was here I fell back on Tiffany’s argument to get 
        meaning out of the stone stanza (to misquote Stevens’s “stanza my stone”).  
        </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Lauterbach’s 
        newer work readjusts the balance between material and immaterial worlds, 
        giving more weight to the former (the words themselves are substance, 
        harder than the <i>stone</i> with its spaces between the <i>st</i> and 
        the <i>one</i>).  Better put, perhaps, her newer work is more consciously 
        philosophical than the early poems, and I think they suffer for it.  But 
        open to the first page of her <i>Selected</i> and the questions are the 
        same; this first page ends “where what is is / changed by language”(3).  
        Lauterbach’s poetics can be summed up in that enjambment, between “what 
        is is” and “is /changed.”  The body of her work contains, <i>is</i>, an 
        idea, and an important one to the history of the lyric and to larger debates 
        that Tiffany, for one, enumerates.</font></p>
