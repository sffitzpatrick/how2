          I have a fault to find with<i> Aleatory Allegories</i>, it is that Susan 
          Schultz&#146;s use of detail is so fascinating that I get caught up in 
          it and neglect to attend to the larger configurations this collection 
          produces. Take the movement of an idea into an image, and the flow from 
          one poem into another: after Schultz reports on a poll on angels which 
          found “half of all Americans believe actual,”(“Oceanic Feeling” 5) in 
          the next poem, she deftly twists David Letterman into Emily Dickinson, 
          “stupid/angel tricks, inebriate godsends (quite/literally).”(“Promised 
          Notes” 7) Or take the hunger in “Spare Ribs” for actual solutions to real 
          and spiritual poverty: this travels from Biblical laws to prophetic caveats 
          for writers by way of commercial schemes:</font></span>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Or note how Schultz starts with Magritte’s denial that 
          representation equals the subject in “Ceci n’est pas,” immediately shifts 
          into an association with Coleridge—“And the hunger in this mouth/that 
          aligns self to a pleasure dome’s decree,” offers to trade “two avant-/gardists 
          for one hegemonic/Victorian,” as if they were baseball cards, and ends 
          up with the beginning of Berryman’s “Dream Song 14”:</span> </font>

        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>But this collection is more than a tour de force, a show 
          of poetic pyrotechnics lighting up obsessions from baseball to brainwaves, 
          the natural to the national, continuously changing angles to reflect more 
          light. (“Submit most baroque life plans/to the zoning board,” she says 
          in “Performance Art.”) The question of representation and its intersection 
          with the real is always linked to the problem of moral agency. Schultz 
          asks about life as art; how, as military strategy, you are to map it, 
          live it happily, knowing that “happily” originally meant “by chance.” 
          (“An arbitrary happiness is elicited by/dissonance,” she says in “Promised 
          Notes,” and in “Ceci n’est pas,” “Accidental happiness is/what there is.”)  
          </span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The logic of this world may turn on random puns, allowing 
          us to deliberate on the fall of spiritual to market values. The book is 
          divided into five sections. In the first, Schultz opens her quest for 
          art into the question of her own motives: “Is it art, or real/danger that 
          confronts me when I/leave my white house to forage/among the witnesses 
          of this world to find another?” (“Oceanic Feeling” 6) Associations take 
          her repeatedly to history, political maneuverings, mothers and language. 
          The second section continues to deal with these issues, countering selfish 
          needs to social ones, examining how things go wrong somewhere between 
          Murphy’s Law and planned obsolescence and attempting to settle there: 
          “This will be/my paradise, this never knowing.”(“Prone in a Rowboat” 20) 
          The third section disturbs this, facing terrible truths that politics 
          and media sensationalize as drama—the war in Bosnia, the existence of 
          death row, the situation of the homeless. “I think there is/such a thing 
          as overload of meaning,/synonymous with the suffering that we/forgive 
          ourselves for seeing.”(“Star-gazing” 49) Schultz directs a stream of questions 
          for Oswald about Kennedy’s death, a paranoid media frenzy commenting on 
          how even the portrayal of justice is distorted and thwarted.(52) In “Safe 
          Haven,” she warns, “Put off posterity: madeleine dipped/in blood triggers 
          centuries of worse.”(54)</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>The fourth part of the collection is Schultz’s long poem, 
          “Holding Patterns.” Earlier, in “Oceanic Feelings,” she discerns, “Recurrence 
          of pattern is confinement”(5). Here, against the “old specter of benign 
          neglect”(62) and the “history of deprivation,”(63) Schultz plots our losses, 
          in some ways caused by what we refuse to do without: </span> </font>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>…Call 
            me bourgeois, I need my music</span><br>

        </blockquote>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>Homelessness runs through the poem, with even (or especially) 
          infants threatened (in real estate language) by amortization; added to 
          this is the crossing of language zones, the insecurity of language’s impact 
          on people: “Are we convertible?”(61) There are moments of advice, the 
          serious mixed with the parodic: “Only adapt”(65); “Attempt no field goal 
          before its time”; “Scan refusal for clues of recompense”(69). Recompense 
          is in the pensive, in the ephemeral transitions of language from one field 
          to another, across the world on email or airplanes or inside the navigation 
          of metaphors. “Our business is to relay possibility”: “screen messages 
          stay fixed/like visualizations meant to/effect cures by symbolism…/…image/visioned 
          to prove poetry’s worth,/the literal healing art of/substitution and eventual/decay.”(71)</span> 
          </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>From this holding pattern, a plane above the world trying 
          to gain an objective view of it, we land precariously: in “Performance 
          Art,” we are still on the mission “to overfly enemy territory, taking/care 
          to avoid friendly fire, noting/…missiles /pointed, you suspect, at your 
          own back yard. No landscape that is not/moralized interests the inner 
          cartographer.”(77) We come then to a series of intersections mapped by 
          the vectors of the recurrent images, the communications, commerce, relations 
          and games (whether baseball or mind), and in these crossings, what was 
          neglected, unknown, unexpected as love, rises to the surface to be cared 
          for. “Finders sweepers;/to the early bird goes the trumpet,”(98) Schultz 
          writes in “Major Funding for Despair.” In “At Chaos Gate,” “order conceived 
          as dry land [is]/where line-ups of cartoon heads/turn to see caravans 
          of power trucks/drive north, where the light was, and is.”(101)</span> 
          </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the end, it is those details, their fascinating and 
          intricate connections, that make us see the complexity of the real world 
          without the flattening attempts of media spins and sound bytes, without 
          the superficiality we can fall for in lazily desiring simple pictures, 
          obvious solutions. Schultz’s allegories reward their reading and deserve 
          re-reading; their attention to the world demonstrates how it is in caring 
          for the small, chance-met things that you find what you need.</span></font>
