          Moxley seems to have turned a corner with her new chapbook of ten poems, 
          <i>Wrong Life.</i> While some of the levity and “moral exhibitionism” 
          (in Benjamin's phrase, describing the early days of Surrealism) of her 
          first collection, <i>Imagination Verses, </i>is still present, it is muted 
          beneath newer concerns with a sort of neo-classical pitch, giving some 
          of the poems a late-classical/early-romantic quality, as if coming from 
          the moment when that shift in poetic sensibility occurred (evinced perhaps 
          best in the work of Coleridge). If these poems can be seen as “lyrics,” 
          they are not departing directly, or solely, from more obvious twentieth 
          century sources such as Frank O’Hara or Beat poetry, nor are they indebted 
          to college workshop poetry or poetry of the “mainstream,” with their often 
          imprecise, unexciting rhythms, images, and ranges of liberal humanist 
          values. But despite their formal concerns&#150;a sort of deep flirtation 
          with the norms of patriarchal tradition&#150;these poems are not “New 
          Formalist” or in any way resembling the kitschy appropriations of a poet 
          like Jacqueline Osterow, who writes humorous, often virtuostic, work in 
          Dantescan tetrameter (but who, unlike Eliot, has no visionary grumbling 
          to add to it); in fact, they rarely stick to any given form, borrowing 
          only the allure of ascetic restraint from such regularity. Moxley, part 
          anarchist and part watchmaker, has no interest in facility for facility’s 
          sake, and if anything chooses paths that trouble her writing rather than 
          show off its endless applicability to life’s daily quandaries. Because 
          the ten poems of <i>Wrong Life</i> fix themselves at this turning-point 
          between a sincere interest in the perfect, platonic forms of Classicism 
          and the spontaneity of Romanticism&#150;a careful reader of literary tradition, 
          she is probably aware of this language game&#150;they also find a place 
          somewhere between late-Modernist ideas of the lyric and what may come 
          next. </font></span></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination 
          Verses </i>, published in 1996, sent a useful signal to many writers that 
          it was time to write “lyrics” again, poems that are spontaneous, subjective 
          (ie. autobiographical and emotive) and “musical,” discarding for the meantime 
          whatever discoveries in form, rhythm and vocabulary that such movements 
          as Dada, Objectivism, Projective Verse and Language Poetry have put forth. 
          The book itself, however, was more than this, and was aware of a wide 
          range of writing&#150;from Duncan's better “Passages” poems to Hart Crane’s 
          soliloquies in “The Bridge,” from Keats to Hejinian&#150;which it displayed 
          in careful, idiosyncratic ways. Like Lee Ann Brown in <i>Polyverse</i>, 
          Moxley showed herself to have acquired a wide range of methods for writing 
          a contemporary "lyric," though she wrote with little of Brown's freewheeling 
          mentality (if anything, she could at times be considered over-earnest 
          or sententious). While this signal for a return to the lyric has become 
          fruitful, one wonders where this dusty image of the “lyric” that people 
          rose to defend and hold against "postmodernism" came from, as if there 
          were a lyric before modernism that anyone felt close to. It became easy 
          to equate the “lyric” (which, again, had never entirely disappeared even 
          in the most constructivist of poetics, Charles Bernstein being a great 
          lyric poet when he’s not goofing off) with a sort of spontaneous, "Whitmanic" 
          perhaps, effusion, a stage for the charming enactment of an emotionally 
          enhanced but destabilized life&#150;a sort of “Drunken Boat” Lite, or 
          O’Hara’s “Meditations in an Emergency” again and again. Some of these 
          newer concerns of the lyric were with the trope itself, ironically an 
          extension of collage poetics which the subjectivity of the lyric should 
          have opposed&#150;perhaps Berrigan's <i>Sonnets</i> is the model for this 
          type of writing. There is nothing wrong with this, of course, and it is 
          sort of refreshing in a Novelle Vague way, like those characters of Godard 
          who found their best moments shooting cap guns in empty wheat fields while 
          quoting Saint-Just to the panoptic gaze of capital. But it seems more 
          interesting, now, in the time after the waning of deconstruction, and 
          in the middle of one of the most conservative periods of American history, 
          to work past the collaged trope, not to mention our special "American" 
          slacker brand of existentialism. Though one could hardly call <i>Imagination 
          Verses </i>“influential” at this point, nor give it all the credit for 
          this situation which, if nothing else, is creating a lot of new poets 
          and a more genuinely engaged poetry culture than has been seen here for 
          a decade, the difference of Moxley’s lyric with some developments in poetry 
          at that time (the mid-nineties, when experimental poets of her age were 
          often latter-day Language writers or working through these influences) 
          and ours (when they are very much not) is worth noting, partly because 
          of her specific concern with tradition itself.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moxley’s 
          tradition is not The Tradition&#150;the European canon, the centrality 
          of “clear expression” in lyrics, hierarchical moral values resting on 
          patriarchal dominance, Oedipal altercations with the Masters, etc.&#150;which 
          it is more or less ok to ignore (certainly since Cage, whose challenge 
          to Western notions of “tradition” have yet to be assimilated). It has 
          more to do with the <i>feel</i> of a “tradition,” or a personal tradition 
          which one controls and occupies, which is a fairly fresh concept these 
          days. It is most interestingly understood as distinguished from “lineage,” 
          a more popular construct in use as a shorthand to discuss new work by 
          poets. This tradition could be seen as one’s personal sense of an accumulating 
          store of methods and ideas, not to mention literary personas, that could 
          be used when writing a poem, and which take one out of the immediate fashions 
          of one’s time into something more purely imaginative (rather than repetitive 
          or reactive), or universal (rather than contingent). Whereas “lineage” 
          implies an adherence to one’s demographic peers or to one’s country, or 
          to a certain literary identity that is shaped by the last few generations 
          of poets, a tradition, even one provisional and idiosyncratic, is a thing 
          that would provide a window on the history of literature, such that one’s 
          responses and appreciations are not entirely horizontal on a temporal 
          plain, nor localized geographically. This tradition&#150;again, one among 
          many, a private culture of sorts, with its own martyrs, scabs and revolutionaries&#150;forces 
          one into a position of taking all the writing in one's immediate surroundings 
          as part of a transient historical moment, and not the inevitable, overdetermined 
          product of history. In this way, tradition is not just the process of 
          working along with one’s past, but of breaking out into one’s time away 
          from the immediate present, a more dynamic sense of working with the language 
          at large. While The Tradition could be seen as a form of socialization, 
          the use of a “tradition” can be used to desocialize out of one's immediate 
          sense of “lineage,” not to mention one’s own immediate political, social 
          or economic milieu. With the stage set across such wider plains&#150;something 
          only an ambitious poet would set out to do&#150;the possible resonances 
          of the language, its words, meters, even symbols, increase, but also the 
          pressure to behave in a manner that does justice to the wider aperture, 
          as the desire for “form” becomes opened up to the entire history of forms. 
          The principles of constructing the "right" form is elevated to those levels 
          usually granted the word.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
          any case, <i>Wrong Life </i>seems to anticipate how the first book, in 
          its confident march into the "lyric", may be read too loosely, something 
          of a parallel to Pound and Eliot's decision to write in quatrains (in 
          <i>Mauberley</i> and the Sweeney poems) to stave off the negative effects 
          of too-free free verse. That is, <i>Wrong Life </i>develops from <i>Imagination 
          Verses </i>in a way that draws a line both for and against the lyric in 
          the contemporary scene. Her immersion in "antique" modes of address (a 
          use of rhetorical stylistics not unlike Lisa Robertson's in <i>Debbie: 
          An Epic</i>, and often as ironized) suggests that she is projecting a 
          seriousness about the artifice of lyric that few would be able to follow. 
          Each line of the poems in <i>Wrong Life</i> is not there merely to set 
          the stage for the possibility of a following line, or to suggest the sort 
          of virtuosity in which the poem lasts as long as the batteries are juiced. 
          Rather, there is the lingering sense that the first line of the poem contains, 
          implicit within it, the last line (a very classical idea), even in the 
          last poem of the sequence, which is a translation. In terms of language, 
          none of the opacities and freed signifiers of early Language poetry, or 
          the objectified and reduced “self” of the <i>nouveau roman</i> or the 
          iconography and contortions of Surrealism are present; it is practically 
          a stand against the “tradition” of modernism itself, perhaps the only 
          book of lyrics in recent times perceptive enough of aesthetic strategies 
          to clearly attempt this<i>.</i> All version of linguistic fracturing having 
          been bound together, or spackled over, with a knotty, baroque rhetoric, 
          not to mention an unapologetically over-dramatized fiction of the self. 
          It’s this lack of apology that permits Moxley to take on The Tradition 
          with open eyes, and hence create a poetry that is unaffected despite its 
          celebration of artifice, a celebration that occasionally borders on kitsch, 
          like in the novels of D'Annunzio, but with, again, a saving, subtle irony 
          that is unique to her writing and often misread.</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
          thing that seems to be happening in <i>Wrong Life </i>is that the soil 
          for a new poetic subjectivity is being tilled, the mise-en-scene orchestrated 
          to such a degree that the “subject,” that creepy, wounded thing that is 
          (or was) the social actor, <i>must</i> surface when the immense pressures 
          of this historical stage bear down strong enough as to produce a faint 
          cry. Judith Butler’s revision of Hegel’s master/slave dialectic in <i>The 
          Psychic Life of Power</i> seems relevant here, as Butler describes how 
          “power” precedes the “subject,” and yet it is this power which “enacts 
          the subject into being.” The subject, then, wields the power herself, 
          hence reversing the traditionally viewed chain of causality, so that, 
          finally: “Agency exceeds the power by which it is enabled.” By setting 
          the stage in this way, Moxley&#150;like all good poets concerned with 
          a disciplined form of writing&#150;gives herself a motivation to maneuver 
          out of easy solutions to emotional and aesthetic dilemmas. Ironically, 
          then, it is not improvisation&#150;a footloose attitude toward life, line 
          and syntax&#150;that becomes the sign of agency, but the reversal of power 
          which can only become present in the midst of a tradition, its symbols, 
          tropes, figures.  This is from “The Second Winter”:</span> </font></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p class=TxBrp4 style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>While 
          the levity of some of her earlier poems is still apparent here (“Opening 
          lines aside” has some of the self-reflexive humor of Ashbery), not to 
          mention the “exhibitionism,” the control of the lines, nearly pushing 
          iambic pentameter but crossing into balladic meters, shows that Moxley 
          has gotten past the idea of an oppressive tradition and found, instead, 
          that a "tradition" provides an interesting way of gauging the particular 
          qualities of her own time. Her “exhaustion” is the well-earned one of 
          finding oneself at the pinnacle of a (symbolic) history, and of having 
          once had a “narrow faith” (“Spring” being, perhaps, a socialist democracy 
          itself) that burned intensely, but is on the verge of disappearing, most 
          likely beneath bureaucracy, technoculture, and the ease of exchange&#150;capitalist, 
          interpersonal, literary&#150;on the market. However, this poem, by posing 
          as a product from before the modernist break, is also free of the trappings 
          of Surrealism, of the dream-life bursting into the waking which is still 
          somehow behind the methods of nearly all experimental American poetry, 
          yet a relationship to the situationist-side of Surrealism remains. Moxley 
          seems to reconfigures this "burst" not as from the dreamlife (of analogies, 
          metaphors, aphasic fracturings) but as a ghost of the past, from the history 
          of forms. The poems, thus, do not assault the reader in classic avant-garde 
          style, but create a recognizable contract, one that itself is a literary 
          artifice, is a little musty and strange, like the description of an interior 
          in Dostoyevsky. In this way, <i>Wrong Life</i> isolates and make clear 
          the truth that hostility itself was or is often an <i>aesthetic</i> component 
          of modernist writing, justified perhaps by political concerns and the 
          effects of “alienation,” but which has taken on its own life as a valorized 
          aesthetic effect, whether it be in Wyndham Lewis, Mayakovsky, Bruce Andrews 
          or Tim Davis (or myself). How many poets could be said to have legitimized 
          hostility as an artistic tactic? Moxley’s particularly unique ventriloquist’s 
          act&#150;the promise of acclimation without the threat of assimilation&#150;as 
          a side effect of its turn on modernism from within avant-garde concerns, 
          makes this idea visible.  </span></font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
          very movement of the final sentence of this excerpt from “The Second Winter” 
          over five lines dramatizes Moxley’s desire to achieve an elaborate wholeness, 
          a singular measure, even if only provisionally and as “exhibition.” If 
          one were to permit an over-used metaphor from our French peers, one could 
          imagine the "Second Winter" being the record of a trek across the white 
          expanse of the page, like an Alpine hiker leaving the first footprints 
          across a "virgin" expanse of snow; in this case, the slowness of the gait, 
          and not anything in the "content," would be the sign and value of her 
          struggle. Her clever rewrite, or sustained echoing, of “Zone,” which she 
          titles “Soleil Cou Coupe” (the final three words of Apollinaire’s poem), 
          seems, in some ways, an elegy for the revolutionary moment, while at the 
          same time it tries to signal a birth&#150;not of the “new” but, perhaps, 
          of the coherent or synthetic poem, or even the "iconic" in the sense of 
          the poem having some of that magical quality that Benjamin was so interested 
          in rediscovering in modern life:</span> </font></p>

          “mental hideaway” is a recurring theme in this book; indeed, Coleridge’s 
          “Lime Tree Bower My Prison,” seems to be a guiding light to some of <i>Wrong 
          Life</i>’s tone. But she also reveals, in this excerpt, some of the pleasure 
          and fraught humor of being someone attentive to the “old”; she is looking 
          to it for things it is fairly ill-equipped to be, which is the new. One 
          could say that Pound wanted the old to be new, but Pound could proceed 
          upon a project like his translation of the Seafarer with the confidence 
          that some of the effects of Anglo-Saxon meters and sound-patterns would 
          resonate in the public ear with the cacophonies of Vorticism and Futurism; 
          he also had a much less globalized cultural world to deal with, so some 
          of his "old" from, say, the Chinese could actually enter with the freshness 
          of the new. It is quite different for Moxley, who is aware that the "new" 
          is a borrowed terms&#150;the “new” having been recycled as a revolutionary 
          prefix for, well, at least a century. It is attention to formal necessity, 
          even if its of a very “old” sort, along with the gaze of a tradition which 
          she chooses to figure as whole (at least as a history to <i>fetishize</i>) 
          that demonstrate Moxley’s consideration of the challenge of Language poetry 
          to our time. She’s taking the methods of the “methodist poets” and turning 
          them upside down, if one divorces the term “process” from any sort of 
          automation (dice-throwing, computers, Oulipian tactics, etc.) entirely 
          and brings it over into the camp of “craft”. But ironically, it is Moxley’s 
          play on “Zone” that strikes one, at least initially, as most indebted 
          to a paratactic sensibility, as if the attempt to make the new out of 
          the “new” via the mannerisms of the “old” required a confrontation with 
          the immediate past, or at least suggested a new use for it. It is this 
          unique dealing with the legacy of the recent avant-garde&#150;an adopting, 
          absorbing, sifting, judging, and occasional expulsing, all processes emphasizing 
          <i>choice</i>&#150;along with her freedom to be “untimely” that places 
          her writing in that between-place, that crisis moment of the Kuhnian "paradigm 
          shift," that is coming after our already academically-exploited, though 
          somehow barely understood, "avant-garde" present. (There are, of course, 
          several possible futures, as there are several presents, all of them exotic, 
          which, even if they are mostly undiscovered, poets will have to continue 
          to strongly imagine against our increasingly heavy, burdening corporate 
          monoculture.)</span></font></p>

          Transom Over Death’s Door” concerns this bind of having followed the idea, 
          or ideal, of collective action from within a collective state of imagination 
          and then of having lost this ideal, perhaps because of a relationship 
          to a "tradition" or something else that subtracted her from easy class 
          and cultural identities. That is, as a younger poet with a somewhat polemic 
          bent and in a milieu not aware of a clear future (her period at Brown, 
          when she was editing <i>The Impercipient</i>), Moxley attained something 
          like “leadership qualities” along with a set of goals for her poetry that 
          she envisioned of value to many others (the “emergent” generation in Steve 
          Evans’ phrase) but which may have turned out to be her own specific dream:</span>

        </blockquote>
        <p class=TxBrp4 style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>What 
          is at stake is the forming of a coherent personal and political platform 
          that takes, as its generative principle, the idea of subjective wholeness 
          and true, informed agency, such that leadership could be, in some not 
          attenuated way, possible. The complexities of authority in a radical conception 
          of democracy become key, since the need to find authority in such a poetic 
          “voice”&#150;a “Homeric” one, in Pound’s sense, in that all of tradition 
          could conceivably be funneled through it&#150;leads back to one’s misgivings 
          about (paternal) authority. But in this “late stage of capitalism” the 
          “authority” seems to be the impersonal exchanges of a faceless body politic 
          and an incomprehensible economic interdependence that supercedes the relationship 
          of the individual to the other, or to the "State," this latter a relationship 
          that, presently, has an almost antiquated “folk” quality when it’s spoken 
          of, as if one needs to be a farmer or a grassroots worker to understand 
          it.  That is, the authority is the spectacle, and though there are defenders 
          of the spectacle, they are hard to isolate from the spectacle itself (and 
          have a squadron of corporate lawyers to keep it that way). So then how 
          does one lay out the principle of the contradictions, dissatisfactions, 
          even criminality, of capital without disappearing into a purely strategic, 
          critique-oriented poetics that is destabilizing, and which, in its pure 
          formalism, has lost the ability to imagine an audience? Will the text 
          ever be able truly to step down from its authoritative role over the reader, 
          and if it can’t, should it not, then, acknowledge the reader by, perhaps, 
          oppressing him/her with attention, coercion, beauty, and even false notes 
          (the "antiquated" langauge) about values, with the hope that agency will 
          spring forth?</span> </font></p>

          psychic battleground, and her determination to make our sense of contemporaneity 
          waver, to array something of the past against the present, doesn’t provide 
          all the answers, but it’s a start, and this chapbook, more than her last 
          book, can be read as a statement of premises. By arranging the many crimes 
          of the “fathers” against her, Moxley “cheers herself up” (in Eliot’s phrase, 
          from his essay on Othello, discussing the moments before the murder), 
          but creates, as well, a series of <i>experiences in language</i>&#150;coherent, 
          extreme and demanding verbal performances&#150;that are not out of place 
          in our poetic culture that thrives on simultaneity, innovation, variety, 
          and bizarre forms of knowledge, even if the poems take on and contradict 
          these desires directly. Each poem in <i>Wrong Life</i>, around which there 
          is a distinctive aura that doesn't suggest blindness so much as a startlingly 
          alien but also familiar perspective, is a different formal assay into 
          subject creation that are as aware of the problems facing poetry as any 
          writing now.</span> </font>
