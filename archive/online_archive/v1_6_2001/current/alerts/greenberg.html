        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“boundless 
          on all sides” ends this recent publication by a fellow <i>How2 </i>contributor, 
          and it is boundlessness—an arching, ambitious and fluid attention to all 
          sorts of projects at once—that marks <i>secret silent plan</i>.  I first 
          heard Linda present excerpts from this book at the NEMLA conference in 
          April 2000 in Buffalo, and then as now, was taken with her investigation 
          of important ideas around the myths and problems of marginalization and 
          of poetic production and poetic identity; public space and poetic identity; 
          feminism and women’s work and poetic identity; graduate student life…and 
          poetic identity.  Not only does Linda manage to nail down specific and, 
          to my mind, groundbreaking theories around all of these divergent and 
          convergent issues, but she is able to do it in an utterly new and readable 
          form, one cast specifically for this particular set of problems.  I am 
          tempted to call the book a hybrid, to use a fashionable term, but the 
          very lack of any adherence to genre transcends even that categorization.  
          I didn’t know Linda when I saw her read from it last year, but I thought 
          she was sharp and funny and bold (and she had great pants); I took copious 
          notes and ran up to talk to her afterwards.  I am therefore very grateful 
          to have her often complicated but always crystal-clear thoughts printed 
          up in secret silent plan.  The book is so confidently its own thing, so 
          useful.  I admire it—and her—greatly.  </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          I assume anyone who is part of the <i>How2</i> community would feel the 
          same way.  Linda dedicates the book to her “imagined community” and I 
          think that <i>How2</i> comes as close to an imagined community for this 
          writing as anything.  Linda may well disagree (and that could be an interesting 
          Postcard!), but consider the following evidence.  For one thing, Linda’s 
          writing feels, to me, out of a Neidecker/Fraser tradition (and our fearless 
          founder is epigraphed) of observational, direct writing which slurs, honeyed, 
          into vernacular and the deeply felt.  In one series, if you can claim 
          sequence here,<span> <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a> </span> 
      she addresses obscured meanings by writing in 
          and through distorted speech: “fell as though there’er something / else 
          swanted to say—why / don’t say that thing?”  By the following page, most 
          of the lines are crossed out, leaving only three lines intact (though 
          all legible) which consider intactness—“as fell and fell, went, slicing, 
          away / cutting clean off the part that / had grown so with misuse of”—and 
          then regain their blurry composure on the next page, darkly and beautifully: 
          “And so whatever passed / then and whatever insurgencies the dream / encouraged 
          were equally inconsequential / little legs dangling from little things, 
          teeth  / laid out, quaking in a row.”</font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Also 
          of particular interest to our community here are the provocative sections 
          on Hettie Jones and the other places where Linda asks what it means to 
          be a Poet while at the same time a woman, a worker, a person.  “She can 
          do three things at once so I suspect she’s not really a very good poet,” 
          a “volunteer” states about Hettie, but Linda is also questioning her own 
          position as academic/scholar/workforce, and in one section, creates a 
          “plan…suitable for a group determined to silently withdraw their services 
          from a dubious and unappreciative institution.”  This blend of politics 
          and humor, personal and universal, are what make secret silent plan such 
          a vital document, and I strongly recommend it.</font></p>

          </span> )  I will claim sequence, or attempt to give you a sense of it.  
          The book begins with a confession of a plan to “withdraw,” suggests the 
          end of an intimacy, brackets itself, mourns what is lost, gives “poetic 
          figures e through l,” takes on the sequence discussed above which begins 
          with a poem called “Fell,” stops to contemplate poetics more directly, 
          goes on to a series of surrealistic Western NY landscapes, reveals the 
          covert anti-institutional operation, begins a separate (?) project entitled 
          “Tired Machines and the Problem of Seeing ‘Margin’” which is first about 
          Hettie Jones in third person, then in more historical terms, then in an 
          imagined one-on-one interview, then being discussed in third person in 
          a play script, then charts the number of steps in takes to walk around 
          the Buffalo campus, then ends with a lovely and elliptical footnote (marginalia) 
          on margins.</font></p>
