        '>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                final sentence of Fanny Howe’s <i>Selected Poems</i> reads “The day should 
                end.”(205) On the opposite page, in the penultimate poem of the volume, 
                Howe confides, “I won’t be able to write from the grave/so let me tell 
                you what I love” and closes her catalog with the <i>coup de grace</i>, 
                “and the short northern nights.”(204) It is a forceful finale, like a 
                pair of chords at the closing of a sonata. What makes this climactic statement 
                of demand (desire’s correlate in Lacan’s terminology) in language so powerful 
                is, of course, what has come before it. The sequence, “O’clock,” is the 
                longest of the text, and, to pay due attention to its affect, the most 
                painful. Howe indeed “uses poetry as a final resource,” as Creeley puts 
                it, a panacea for enemies ideological as they are existential.</font></span>

        '>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before “O’clock” come fifteen 
                “sequences,” which I put in quotes because five consist of only one poem. 
                These are not arranged accidentally. The sequence form allows a poet to 
                work out an idea; the sequence of sequence, a series of ideas. Howe uses 
                the first to name her enemy and begin her vocation as poet. “I’d speak 
                as if I wasn’t afraid of inhaling/A memory I want to forget/Like I trusted 
                a world which wasn’t mine” (5), she states at the opening of the first 
                sequence, “Introduction to the World.” The “world” the speaker cannot 
                recognize is the falsely imposed ideological construction of “objectivity” 
                which sanctifies and masks its injustices under the guise of objectivity, 
                as becomes clearer in the volume. It is the world of “realism”:</span>

        '>One is reminded of Adorno and Horkheimer’s identification of oppression with 
                myth, “magic” to Howe. So Howe escapes “the Creator,” to “ache at the 
                strange/Creations, mine, which like women/Look new in the court of God”(16) 
                in her conclusion to the “Introduction” sequence. Already gender oppression, 
                the fetishization of “women,” is identified with poetry. “Afraid of inhaling/A 
                memory [she] want[s] to forget,” Howe is aware of the difficulties of 
                poetry outlined by Adorno in “On Lyric Poetry and Society,” as well as 
                the social character of experience and the possibility of ideological 
                tainting. But she is just as aware at the possibilities of revealing “the 
                idea of a free humankind” whose potential Adorno seeks. She has already 
                set out at that work in the first sequence by establishing an expression 
                of the self that is conscious of the ideology of “objectivity,” recognizing 
                with Adorno that “pure subjectivity… bears witness to its opposite,” that 
                “the lyric work is always the subjective expression of social antagonism.” 
                Remember too, Howe debunks consensus which Zizek identifies as the only 
                truth beyond ideology in <i>The Spectre of Ideology</i>.</span></font></p>

        '> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next two sequences, 
                “Q,” and “The Nursery,” Howe genders her act of creative dissent, associating 
                poetic creation with maternity. “Creation was the end that preceded the 
                means…A boy emerged from the cocoon”(24), she writes in the sixth poem 
                of “Q.” “A buried bulb/develops under these conditions the way mothering/turns 
                the wilds into a resolution”(27), she continues in the next section. Later 
                in “Q” she will meditate on the whole project of the book:</span></font></p>

        '> The book is revealed to be a self-contained whole, an argument. Before the 
                final section of “Q” Howe wonders, “How to give birth to children under 
                these conditions,” the conditions being that of “The air force hit[ting] 
                space/with the velocity of a satanic wrist” to “favor the ghost over the 
                father, maternalist.”(30) Howe’s happiness resides in her creative maternity

        '>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the final <i>tour de 
                force</i> of “O’clock” Howe meditates on what she finds left over from 
                the world she has retreated from: her self. “The self is a servant only/To 
                its source,”(101) she writes in “The Vineyard.” In reaction to the world, 
                the self is a bearer of duty, a duty that she fulfills with her poetry 
                of critique. Later, in “In the Spirit There Are No Accidents,” she will 
                contemplate that moment “[w]hen the world takes up no space but I.”(124) 
                In “The Sea Garden” she writes</span> </font>

        '>The poem is one about language in Howe’s lexicon: note the vine and child imagery. 
                “Rapture in exile—paradox,” Howe defines the self in the linguistic field.  
                This state is one of paradox, ambiguities, “rapture” describing her experience 
                as poet, while “exile” suggests her disjunction from a language she cannot 
                own—“like the heat of a true vine.” “The ego really is an object,” states 
                Lacan in his second seminar (1954-1955), adding that “speech comes from 
                the location we give to our ego,” a “romantic illusion.” “The <i>ego </i>is 
                always an <i>alter-ego</i>” always another to Lacan, and in a sublime 
                moment, Howe notes the world <i>objet A</i>, merging with herself. It 
                is the ultimate recognition of the self as other, indistinguishable from 
                world. Howe has made the journey of abandoning language for phenomenality, 
                a primordial return to the imaginary, preceding the poetic. The symbolic’s 
                rupture from the imaginary legitimizes the poetic even more in consciousness’s 
                dialectical awareness of movement to that from which it breaks. Such “mysticism” 
                is not alien to Howe’s poetics: she often speaks of God and the afterlife, 
                as hyperbolized ultimate signs of the reality of the ideal, which is put 
                to the service of the material.</span> </font>

                poems”(150) the use of poetry is affirmed, but the vagabondage is recorded.
