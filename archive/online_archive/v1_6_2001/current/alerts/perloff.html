          1919, Marcel Duchamp bought on the rue de Rivoli, a cheap postcard reproduction 
          of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> and decided to give Leonardo’s famous enigmatic 
          face a black-penciled mustache, curling up at the corners, and a neat 
          small goatee. Underneath the portrait, Duchamp inscribed the letters <i>L.H.O.O.Q</i>, 
          a sequence which, read aloud in French, equals <i>elle a chaud au cul</i> 
          (she has a hot ass). But his was not just a crude joke; as he explained 
          it many years later, “The curious thing about that moustache and goatee 
          is that when you look at the <i>Mona Lisa</i> it becomes a man.  It is 
          not a woman disguised as a man; it is a real man, and that was my discovery, 
          without realizing it at the time.”  </font></span> 
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here 
          Duchamp implies playfully what Freud, in his famous study of Leonardo 
          da Vinci, took very seriously—namely the artist’s latent homosexuality. 
          In both cases, the model herself (a local merchant’s wife) is seen as 
          mere object—“the occasion for these ruses,” to use Frank O’Hara’s phrase 
          in “In Memory of my Feelings.” And of course art historians have taken 
          this object status as given: Ernst Gombrich, for example, argues that 
          the universal appeal of the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile may be attributed 
          to “Leonardo’s famous invention which the Italians call <i>sfumato</i>—the 
          blurred outline and mellowed colors that allow one form to merge with 
          another and always leave something to our imagination.”</span> </font>
        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, 
          the painting’s <i>sfumato</i> does leave something to the imagination, 
          and in her brilliantly inventive <i>Luca: Discourse on Life and Death</i>, 
          Rochelle Owens has imaginatively recreated Mona Lisa from multiple perspectives, 
          including Mona Lisa’s own. Owens’s is a profound meditation on how Leonardo’s 
          painting—the very epitome of Renaissance art—was really produced and disseminated, 
          and what the process meant to the women (Mona and her friend Flora, who 
          appears in so many Leonardo works) as well as the children who served 
          as the models for Jesus and St. John the Baptist in various paintings. 
          Owens’s “narrative”—which is complexly disjunctive, weaving in and out 
          of Renaissance Florence, our own time, and the more distant past of pre-Columbian 
          cultures—circles around three characters: “Lenny” (Leonardo) the artist/scientist, 
          the artist’s model Mona Lisa, referred to here as Mona or <i>La Gioconda</i> 
          (“the smiling woman”), as the painting is also called, and Siggy or Sigmund 
          Freud, whose rationalist analysis destroys the heart and soul of the culture 
          it “murders to dissect.” In the course of the narrative, Mona and Flora 
          become part of a larger company of women, especially poor women from various 
          Indian tribes, who continue to be oppressed in the Americas of the present</span>

  style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
          passage gives us a good idea of the diction and tone that distinguish 
          <i>Luca</i> from most poetry written today. Owens’s theme, here as in 
          <i>The Joe Poems</i> or <i>Futz</i>, is that of <i>violation</i>—the violation 
          of one person’s space by those others who want to control or absorb it, 
          who will not let it be. Freud’s “fibrous memory” won’t let the Leonardo 
          story be; he has to explain away childhood memories as homosexual fantasies 
          and find explanatory mechanisms for the artist’s sublimation. But Owens 
          doesn’t relate these things dispassionately: in her macabre vision, Freud 
          is seen “hook[ing] [his] neck” and, in a horrific image, “saturat[ing 
          [his] dry/ eyelids with oil.” Owens does not shrink from the violence 
          and horror she finds everywhere around her and which she projects back, 
          most convincingly, into what was supposed to be, according to Burckhardt 
          and Berenson, the ordered and measured world of Renaissance Florence. 
          This poet enters her narrative and calls the shots as she sees them:</span>

          should read, “the rule / in most cases [is that] the patient adjusts,/following 
          this three to seven fine sutures of silk or dug-gut.” And even the adjectival

          Owens’s writing, here as elsewhere, is <i>sui generis</i>. She is, in 
          many ways, a proto-language poet, her marked ellipses, syntactic oddities, 
          and dense and clashing verbal surfaces recalling the long poems of Bruce 
          Andrews and Ron Silliman. But Owens is angrier, more energetic, and more 
          assertive than most of her Language counterparts, male and female, and 
          she presents herself as curiously non-introspective. Hers is a universe 
          of stark gesture, lightning flash, and uncompromising judgement; it is 
          imperative, in her poetic world, to face up to the horror, even as the 
          point of view is flexible enough to avoid all dogmatism.</span> </font>

          learned, sophisticated, and witty in its conceits, this <i>Discourse on 
          Life and Death</i> demands two kinds of reading. First, it should be read 
          through from beginning to end as if it were a novel; in this instance, 
          our concern is with character and the interchange between people, and 
          we watch carefully as Mona and Flora and the children evolve before our 
          eyes. But a second reading is required so as to note the poem’s microstructure—its 
          superb modulation of rhythms and internal rhymes, its ironies and paradoxes. 
          It is the layering of cultures and especially of myths including our own 
          contemporary myths of the Great Creative Genius (always male), creating 
          beauty out of the detritus around him, that makes <i>Luca</i> so distinctive. 
          Watch out, Owens seems to be saying, for those high-minded claims and 
          take another look at the evidence of actual life—“a stream of molten lava 
          burning,” “doses of nitrogen muscle saliva,” or even “the seams / of a 
          discarded wallet.” Owens has no easy answers for the pain and sorrow she 
          presents for our contemplation but her insistent questioning is itself 
          a gift.</span> </font>
