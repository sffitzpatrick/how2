style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        1919, Marcel Duchamp bought on the rue de Rivoli, a cheap postcard reproduction 
        of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> and decided to give Leonardo’s famous enigmatic 
        face a black-penciled mustache, curling up at the corners, and a neat 
        small goatee. Underneath the portrait, Duchamp inscribed the letters <i>L.H.O.O.Q</i>, 
        a sequence which, read aloud in French, equals <i>elle a chaud au cul</i> 
        (she has a hot ass). But his was not just a crude joke; as he explained 
        it many years later, “The curious thing about that moustache and goatee 
        is that when you look at the <i>Mona Lisa</i> it becomes a man.  It is 
        not a woman disguised as a man; it is a real man, and that was my discovery, 
        without realizing it at the time.”  </font></span> 
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here 
        Duchamp implies playfully what Freud, in his famous study of Leonardo 
        da Vinci, took very seriously—namely the artist’s latent homosexuality. 
        In both cases, the model herself (a local merchant’s wife) is seen as 
        mere object—“the occasion for these ruses,” to use Frank O’Hara’s phrase 
        in “In Memory of my Feelings.” And of course art historians have taken 
        this object status as given: Ernst Gombrich, for example, argues that 
        the universal appeal of the Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile may be attributed 
        to “Leonardo’s famous invention which the Italians call <i>sfumato</i>—the 
        blurred outline and mellowed colors that allow one form to merge with 
        another and always leave something to our imagination.”</span> </font>
      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, 
        the painting’s <i>sfumato</i> does leave something to the imagination, 
        and in her brilliantly inventive <i>Luca: Discourse on Life and Death</i>, 
        Rochelle Owens has imaginatively recreated Mona Lisa from multiple perspectives, 
        including Mona Lisa’s own. Owens’s is a profound meditation on how Leonardo’s 
        painting—the very epitome of Renaissance art—was really produced and disseminated, 
        and what the process meant to the women (Mona and her friend Flora, who 
        appears in so many Leonardo works) as well as the children who served 
        as the models for Jesus and St. John the Baptist in various paintings. 
        Owens’s “narrative”—which is complexly disjunctive, weaving in and out 
        of Renaissance Florence, our own time, and the more distant past of pre-Columbian 
        cultures—circles around three characters: “Lenny” (Leonardo) the artist/scientist, 
        the artist’s model Mona Lisa, referred to here as Mona or <i>La Gioconda</i> 
        (“the smiling woman”), as the painting is also called, and Siggy or Sigmund 
        Freud, whose rationalist analysis destroys the heart and soul of the culture 
        it “murders to dissect.” In the course of the narrative, Mona and Flora 
        become part of a larger company of women, especially poor women from various 
        Indian tribes, who continue to be oppressed in the Americas of the present</span>

        and abstracted—and always consumed by his work.  Sigmund is his alter

style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
        passage gives us a good idea of the diction and tone that distinguish 
        <i>Luca</i> from most poetry written today. Owens’s theme, here as in 
        <i>The Joe Poems</i> or <i>Futz</i>, is that of <i>violation</i>—the violation 
        of one person’s space by those others who want to control or absorb it, 
        who will not let it be. Freud’s “fibrous memory” won’t let the Leonardo 
        story be; he has to explain away childhood memories as homosexual fantasies 
        and find explanatory mechanisms for the artist’s sublimation. But Owens 
        doesn’t relate these things dispassionately: in her macabre vision, Freud 
        is seen “hook[ing] [his] neck” and, in a horrific image, “saturat[ing 
        [his] dry/ eyelids with oil.” Owens does not shrink from the violence 
        and horror she finds everywhere around her and which she projects back, 
        most convincingly, into what was supposed to be, according to Burckhardt 
        and Berenson, the ordered and measured world of Renaissance Florence. 
        This poet enters her narrative and calls the shots as she sees them:</span>

        of reference produced by syntactic ellipsis and a quirky absence of punctuation. 
        In lines 8-9, one expects a period after “rupture,” and the next phrase 
        should read, “the rule / in most cases [is that] the patient adjusts,/following 
        this three to seven fine sutures of silk or dug-gut.” And even the adjectival 
        modifier here is non-sensical. A surgeon might say, “Give him three to 
        seven sutures” or “He will need three to seven sutures,” but in what situation 
        would one say, “following this three to seven fine sutures”? If one knows

        urin<i>ate</i>/ <i>pot</i>assium, <i>rupt</i>ure, <i>patient</i>, <i>sut</i>ures,

        the many threads of the Mona/Flora story—threads that come together, later 
        in the poem when the Renaissance motifs are seen through Aztec and Mayan 
        prisms—words like “Aztec” and “Tlaloc,” reinforcing the sound structure 
        of the earlier passages and ironizing the claims of the <i>conquistadores</i> 
        whose plunder of American soil parallels Lenny’s earlier plunder of the 
        very bodies and souls of his female models in the interest of anatomical 
        study as well as the art of painting.  </span> </font>

        Owens’s writing, here as elsewhere, is <i>sui generis</i>. She is, in 
        many ways, a proto-language poet, her marked ellipses, syntactic oddities, 
        and dense and clashing verbal surfaces recalling the long poems of Bruce 
        Andrews and Ron Silliman. But Owens is angrier, more energetic, and more 
        assertive than most of her Language counterparts, male and female, and 
        she presents herself as curiously non-introspective. Hers is a universe 
        of stark gesture, lightning flash, and uncompromising judgement; it is 
        imperative, in her poetic world, to face up to the horror, even as the 
        point of view is flexible enough to avoid all dogmatism.</span> </font>

        learned, sophisticated, and witty in its conceits, this <i>Discourse on 
        Life and Death</i> demands two kinds of reading. First, it should be read 
        through from beginning to end as if it were a novel; in this instance, 
        our concern is with character and the interchange between people, and 
        we watch carefully as Mona and Flora and the children evolve before our 
        eyes. But a second reading is required so as to note the poem’s microstructure—its 
        superb modulation of rhythms and internal rhymes, its ironies and paradoxes. 
        It is the layering of cultures and especially of myths including our own 
        contemporary myths of the Great Creative Genius (always male), creating 
        beauty out of the detritus around him, that makes <i>Luca</i> so distinctive. 
        Watch out, Owens seems to be saying, for those high-minded claims and 
        take another look at the evidence of actual life—“a stream of molten lava 
        burning,” “doses of nitrogen muscle saliva,” or even “the seams / of a 
        discarded wallet.” Owens has no easy answers for the pain and sorrow she 
        presents for our contemplation but her insistent questioning is itself 
        a gift.</span> </font>
