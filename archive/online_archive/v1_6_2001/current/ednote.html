        has always been a site of exchange—a place where the written is read, 
        the news is passed on, and thoughts discussed.  In issue 6, this concept 
        is both celebrated and theorized.  The new writing section, for instance, 
        features a range of collaborations.  While Rena Rosenwasser presents a 
        history of Kelsey St. Press’s collaboration series, Frances Presley considers 
        what it might mean to undertake a “collaboration in the feminine.”  How 
        are processes of identification and individuation played out?  What happens 
        to notions of authorship and authority?  Such questions are complicated 
        when collaboration shifts across mediums, where it is perhaps best seen 
        as a process of composition.  In addition to the collaborations featured 
        in the new writing section, we feature “The X, Y, Z of It” in the multimedia 
        section.  This ambitious collaboration involves written text, pre-existing 
        audio recordings, and artwork.  Brian Kim Stefans also makes use of new 
        technologies to draw the reader into a visual and textual interaction 
        with his interview with Kim Rosenfield.</font> 
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Collaboration 
        prefigures the necessity of dialogue.  It might perhaps been seen as a 
        kind of micro-community.  Our other new writing section, “Writing from 
        Vancouver,” considers work being produced by a regional constellation 
        of poets.  Whereas the Australian writing feature in our last issue was 
        organized around a thematics of passion, this issue considers writing 
        through location.  What are the concerns emerging out of a particular 
        city if viewed not as an island but as a permeable, rhizomatic site where 
        influences come into it, cross between it and generate out from it?  How 
        might such cultural traffic be reflected in poetry?  Considering the complexity 
        of the particular (and its resistance to the pull of globalization), forum 
        coordinators, Kornelia Freitag and Brian Reed, ask “[I]sn’t one of the 
        most fascinating aspects of poetry its linguistic and cultural specificity, 
        its untranslatability?”  At the same time, they want to consider the prospect 
        of a transnational community emerging in women’s experimental verse.  
        What advantages might such a community have?  How would it operate and 
        how might it be theorized?  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Strategies 
        of exchange, polylingualism, and translation are particularly pertinent 
        in such debates.  With issue 6, our translation section returns, extending 
        the possibilities of international exchange.  Louis Armand and Clare Wallace 
        present their translations against the original texts of French poet, 
        Véronique Vassiliou.  Sawako Nakayasu provides a lengthy translator’s 
        note for her exciting translations of Ito Hiromi’s writing.  Ito’s work 
        provides a startling insight and commentary on contemporary Japanese culture.  
        Through her translations, Nakayasu introduces many HOW2 readers to this 
        work and to consider at times, certain resonances with Western culture, 
        such as dominant attitudes surrounding femininity and motherhood.  There 
        are resonances too with Rose Alcalá’s translations of Lourdes Vázquez’s 
        Latin American work, both Ito­ and Vázquez using the cat as a trope of 
        the feminine in their representation of desire and loss.  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our 
        “Readings” for issue 6 have been divided into two sections: “The Poetics 
        of Encounter” and “Robin Hyde and New Zealand Modernism.”  “The Poetics 
        of Encounter” contains a number of actual encounters: Dell Olsen interviews 
        Joan Retallack, Norma Cole and Susan Gevirtz read one another’s work; 
        and Kimberly Lamm, Kristin Prevallet and Melissa Buzzeo have a conversation 
        about Lyn Hejinian’s <i>The Language of Inquiry</i>.  But there are also 
        a number of other papers that consider what could be called a “poetic 
        encounter,” what Lamm suggests might be “an attentive testing of how literature 
        illuminates and complicates the ways language structures one’s encounter 
        with the world.”  A poetic encounter considers the ethics arising from 
        the risky crossing between language and experience.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        other “Readings” section considers encounters with a past figure, New 
        Zealand modernist, Robin Hyde.  In a special co-publication with the New 
        Zealand Electronic Poetry Center, we feature both published and unpublished 
        examples of Hyde’s poetry, a selection of previously unpublished correspondence, 
        and an example of her journalism.  Both Michele Leggott and Lisa Docherty 
        consider how the archive shapes our engagement with Hyde.  Other contributors 
        consider the changing reception of Hyde’s work as it was rejected or marginalized 
        through the nationalising projects of the early and mid-twentieth century, 
        embraced by second wave feminism, and now reconsidered through a historicist 
        or cultural lens.  Through taking Hyde as a case study, we might also 
        begin to understand the role of gender in constructions of New Zealand 
        modernism.  We are particularly pleased to be able to present our feature 
        on Hyde as part of a special co-publication with the New Zealand Electronic 
        Poetry Center.  Developed by Leggott and Brian Flaherty, the NZEPC began 
        its fully fledged existence in July 2001.  HOW2 readers will be able to 
        link to the NZEPC site to read a further, complementary range of Hyde’s 
        writings and critical responses.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
        the section on Robin Hyde foregrounds issues of erasure, marginality, 
        and recovery, the in-conference section also deals with the politics of 
        presence and the present.  These essays were first presented at the Oxford 
        Brookes colloquium on <i>The Politics of Presence: Re-reading the Writing 
        Subject in “Live” and Electronic Performance, Theatre and Film Poetry 
        </i>in April this year.  As Romana Huk points out, “The necessity of rethinking 
        identity politics and their impact on the social sphere according to newly 
        located and temporalized rather than “generic” models of difference makes 
        the collocation of performance discourse (with its re-<i>placement</i> 
        of the female body) and those of gender politicking seem exhilarating 
        and timely.  This is particularly so given the range of new media and 
        modes in which to experiment with what Caroline Bergvall refers to as 
        the context-specific and continually moving quantity of ‘presentness’ 
        rather than ‘presence.’”  </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the work/book section, Patricia Dienstfrey explores presence in writing 
        in <i>Love and Illustration</i>, particularly the <i>virtus</i> (Latin 
        for supernatural or divine power) of the text at the level of letters, 
        syllables and phonemes.  She further considers the relationships between 
        the text and the phenomenal world.  Our alerts includes reviews both of 
        the community (the Australian anthology, <i>Calyx</i>) and of collaboration 
        (Jo and Drew Milne’s <i>Pianola</i>).  They also cover reviews of challenging 
        new work and long awaited collections.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our 
        title “Ex-change” also foregrounds the coming of change.  In late June, 
        I took up a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale and Temple for a year.  Our 
        managing editor, Kate Fagan, did an incredible job of holding HOW2 together 
        during the surrounding months and of ensuring that the deadlines of various 
        sections were met.  Given our experience of working closely together on 
        HOW2, Kate and I are confident that the distance between us will not affect 
        the running of HOW2.  Thanks also to our webmaster, Roberta Sims, and 
        to the coordinators and contributors who helped make this transition so 
        much easier.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        second change was far greater: the events of September 11.  This issue 
        was planned well before then but in production when the terrorist attacks 
        in the United States occurred.  A number of HOW2 coordinators, contributors, 
        and members of the editorial advisory board were directly affected.  The 
        next few weeks were spent renewing contact with one another and drawing 
        together the HOW2 community.  A spontaneous discussion arose between the 
        EA Board, some of which has been excerpted and now appears in our “Postcards” 
        section.   While some of us wondered how to write after September 11, 
        others reconsidered the role of poetry in public discourse. Thinking about 
        writing’s relationship to trauma, mourning, and witness is particularly 
        pressing.  At the same time, it is worth remembering the role of writing 
        as a medium of exchange and its value in approaching the other.  Our next 
        issue will be a special issue addressing innovative women’s writing after 
        September 11.  Elisabeth Frost and Linda Kinnahan will help in organizing 
        this issue.  There will still be a number of individual pieces and feature 
        sections that do not necessarily touch on issues surrounding the September 
        11 events and their aftermath.  We have a section on Lorine Niedecker 
        that has long been planned.  But we are hopeful that the issue as a whole 
        will be a resonant and valuable one.</font></p>
