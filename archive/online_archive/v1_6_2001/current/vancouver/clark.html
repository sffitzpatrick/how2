            even a fragmentary one, has a centre which attracts it. This centre 
            is not fixed but is displaced by the pressure of the book and circumstances 
            of its composition. Yet it is also a fixed centre which, if it is genuine, 
            displaces itself, while remaining the same and becoming always more 
            central, more hidden, more uncertain and more imperious. He who writes 
            the book writes it out of desire for this centre and out of ignorance.

            long been said that the desert is monotheistic. Is it illogical or devoid

            and to the disorientation of habitual reflexes? [...] Psychogeography 
            could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects

        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Can I say 
          that out of desire for just this “uncertain,” “displaced,” “fixed” and 
          unfixed booklike centre, and out of ignorance of that centre, <i>Raddle 
          moon </i>is a kind of psychogeography which rightly resists description 
          (incl. my own) but which draws the work which belongs to it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I started 
          to write this thing, as you all know, in the belief that <i>Raddle moon 
          </i>had always been suspicious of pre-emptive self-description, of “platforms”; 
          wanted (from survival instinct) to stay out the way of certain historicizing 
          machines that prefab’d and demo’d them, wanted to believe the magazine 
          had always declared its intentions quite simply by enacting them, etc. 
          etc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Wanted to 
          make a space, not take a stand. That. (Realizing that that “that” may 
          relate partly to our history, which I’ve tried to write for Charles.) 
          So, <i>Raddle moon </i>as psychogeography—a haunted, porous “no-place,” 
          implicated but motile, built of little but the trace of the work that’s 
          appeared there “agglomerative, bulgy, made and unmade” what I’ve called 
          a “utopia of shoddy upkeep,” despairing of time, money and energy—at least 
          seems something I recognize, know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Utopia: 
          “In this vested, gendered, entirely fraught medium, the real question 
          is what is being celebrated” (Laura Moriarty, in the Women/Writing/Theory 
          colloquium in <i>Raddle Moon</i> 11) and “The state had come to us fragmentary. 
          Our writing was unavoidable” (Norma Cole, <i>ibid,</i> ditto) for instance. 
          An unpocketable and disheveled field, Possibility. Blanchot’s book, unfinished 
          over and over again each issue, each work contributing to the “pull” of 
          that more and more complexly informed, even demanding (“imperious”), centre 
          that brings the work towards it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If <i>Raddle 
          moon </i>is that psychogeography made of the trace of writers and artists 
          across it and by the temporary local coherences they’ve made (am I going 
          to call that effect “community” in a moment?) it is this space that attracts 
          our future work profoundly. And by future work, I don’t just mean work 
          that’s out there and might think <i>Raddle moon </i>an appropriate venue. 
          I mean work that hasn’t been written yet. And of course I think a lot 
          about women’s work here. Like any editor, I know how difficult it still 
          is to bring out women’s work. Proust said don’t be afraid to go too far 
          because that’s where the real work is. If I’m going to be utopian, I’m 
          going to say that’s the psychogeography I aspire to: the place where writers, 
          especially women, feel they can go “too far.” </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, ok, 
          <i>it’s my job </i>as editor to be utopian! (if for no other reason than 
          because, as Erin so succinctly puts it, How else?) But if a “no-place” 
          which will make future work, in some sense, possible is all I care about 
          these days, I can’t say I’m yet clear about how to get there. Struggling 
          with a number of, for me, unworkable notions of what it is a magazine 
          does over the years (all that early roaming the world in search of new 
          poetic means was necessary, perhaps, who knows) allowed me finally to 
          recognize what courage the very existence of a periodical like Kathleen 
          Fraser’s <i>HOW(ever)</i>—which I first saw years after hearing about 
          it, and becoming aware of its effects—could give and how courage became 
          new thought and new work. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Tish</i>—the 
          great Canadian example of exactly this in my own backyard—seemed more 
          distant in time, gender and (so I then thought) poetics. So I didn’t get 
          to see “it” happen close up until around 1989, when <i>Barscheit</i> (Christine 
          Stewart, Catriona Strang, Lisa Robertson, eds.) occurred. Its very ephemerality 
          (printed on hijacked equipment and “borrowed” paper, disseminated for 
          free, and quickly), the sense of its constant immanence—there was no publishing 
          schedule, so at any moment there could be a <i>Barscheit</i>—and its guerrilla-style 
          protest against the silencing of unfashionable poetry/poetics (an unspoken 
          editorial policy being to print works which would be rejected at this 
          or that other magazine—in the same way <i>Tish</i> saw itself publishing 
          what <i>Prism</i> couldn’t accept) made a literal space, an opening; found 
          and amplified what Norma often calls a “conversation” and got it within 
          earshot of others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So: that’s 
          a use. While I was figuring this out, of course, everything changed. Cyberspace 
          makes a small-circulation, booklike magazine look a very strange way of 
          finding like minds, and a certainly clumsy way of making a relational 
          context for varied works of writing and image. (I look at Laura’s glorious 
          online <i>non<a href="#_ftn1"
  name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup> [1] </sup></a></i> and regret the sad weight of 
          the physical world! Can these bulky ephemerals, largely scorned after 
          their period is up, any longer justify being printed in sweat, trees and 
          wheelbarrowloads of cash? When they’re landfill the back issues of <i>non</i> 
          will be behind a click-icon, ever-present.) Delight in the object (still 
          evident in new beauties like <i>The Germ, Boxkite, Rhizome, </i>among 
          others)—and an ever more capacious web site—is my defence, for now.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Re: l’archivisme, 
          or “the circumstance of its composition”</u></font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You kindly 
          as ever get in the way of my cramped impulse to throw the past out. (“When 
          I see the word ‘positioning,’ I vomit”) So, how to speak this history? 
          In many ways, it now seems to me the record of an exploration of the use 
          of public space. Therefore the record of my/our gradually shifting understandings 
          of that space. Like a city of invisible but potent—or nicely temporary, 
          but potent—architecture. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, what 
          happened here? Well, <i>Raddle moon </i>published its first issue as <i>The 
          raddle moon</i> Feb.14.84 as a 6”x 9” perfectbound booklike object of 
          about 100 pages ostensibly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the University 
          of Victoria’s Creative Writing Department. Born—in our minds—out of sheer 
          desire to make “something where there was nothing” (as Melissa says) in 
          a fairly primitive, if urgent, sense.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Truth is, 
          publishing up a wobbly literary from within a university writing department 
          need not be a carefully deliberated act. The magazine answered a particular 
          moment of available tools: departmental money; a computer; a background 
          in book editing and publishing; friendship (most importantly with Kathryn 
          MacLeod, with whom I edited the first four issues); stubbornness, energy 
          and a sense of “leaving home” aesthetically (predictably, our relationship 
          with the university didn’t last beyond the first issue).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Behind that 
          energy was the compulsion Kathryn and I felt to force open a window under 
          threat of suffocation in the stale party atmosphere of the done-to-death 
          Canadian Content drive which only a decade earlier had come as a genuinely 
          liberating force. As our manifesto in the third issue put it: “Perhaps 
          because we come from an island ourselves and recognize the symptoms, we 
          begin to see Canada as a tiny isolate land. And feel, nationally, ‘bushed’. 
          We notice that our drawers are stuffed with airmail stationery.” Or, you 
          might say perceived limitation (“perhaps we are just greedy: the plateful 
          in front of us not big enough for our eyes” the same editorial continues) 
          manifested an extreme desire which in turn catalysed adaptive evolutionary 
          changes (as some say species’ desire does). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We were 
          at the end of those glory days of the ’60s and ’70s when the small press 
          publishers in Canada—Talonbooks, Anansi, Coach House, etc.—had birthed 
          and unearthed a new national literature and urged us all in large-character 
          posters to READ CANADIAN. We were kids, but a slightly older generation 
          of practicing poets had found out mid-career what it was like to read, 
          write and publish Here, not There (not Britain, not the USA). Life was 
          fine. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For those 
          of us still in highschool—to chart the <i>absolute</i> history of <i>Raddle 
          moon</i>, but also of the country—it had meant that by 1969, our 24-year-old 
          English teacher knew it was important to read Phyllis Webb’s recent <i>Naked 
          Poems</i> to her class of fifteen-year-olds....Here, suddenly (3:30pm, 
          Wednesday, in the bleak cold “New Wing”) for some unknown reason, were 
          these miracles of deft, ironic sureness, this Raven-like trickster, shimmering 
          with an unblinking, self-conscious intelligence, opened to paradox, the 
          political, the sexual and language itself. Here, for some unknown reason, 
          was this woman, this Canadian, thinking aloud in a way we’d never known 
          a human to think or speak. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But CanLit 
          turned out to contain no other Phyllis Webbs. It was a small literature, 
          after all, no matter how urgently and famously it was boiling up all around. 
          Ten years later, predictably, we didn’t get what we’d been given and you 
          could say we were bored. Young writers we knew tended to read nothing 
          but the same few Canadians—if they read at all (that Salinger “purity” 
          model). Of course there was a lot else going on in Canada we didn’t know 
          about and might not have recognized if we had. Of course, of course. It 
          must have been very different in Vancouver—<i>Tish</i> being the evidence—where 
          the Black Mountain feed had come in, but the ocean’s quite a moat, you 
          know, and by the late seventies, at least in Victoria, it was getting 
          a bit difficult to breathe. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, restlessness, 
          comradeship, and a budget morphed <i>From An Island</i> (which <i>Raddle 
          moon </i>officially replaced) into a kind of “to-an-island”—an import 
          rather than an export model. And for the first few issues, we had editors 
          in places as far off-centre as possible: north of 60 (the promised multi-layered 
          Inuit sound poetry turned out to be impossible to translate, and sacred), 
          Haifa, Florence, Africa, Japan. And the name to name this: “moon marked 
          with red ochre,” “earth as moon made of (red) earth”—in fact, three words 
          we liked as a sound, a little prosody exercise.         </font></p>

        <p class=quot><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          relationship with alterity is the original case of this affliction of 
          the present of consciousness with a past that it cannot render present, 
          represent. The present is afflicted with a bond with something that comes 
          to pass without being convertible into an initiative of the present, and 
          that holds on, and in this hold distends one.  — Levinas</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’ve been 
          reading your conversation with Yedda Morrison in <i>Tripwire,</i> hearing 
          you saying things like, “For me, where I can say <i>politicize</i> I have 
          to say the word <i>generosity</i>. Implicit in being political is trying 
          to restore the human face.” And my attention’s caught by your mention 
          of the problem of “unrecognizability.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’ve been 
          thinking about “use” and “sufficiency” (re: <i>Raddle moon</i>, re: whatever 
          publication; re: public spaces) and about evolution’s both adaptive and 
          unforeseen solutions to life-threatening situations and how these are 
          different from the revolutionary (revolving) solutions proposed by certain 
          aesthetics and how much attention I’ve given them, thinking there was 
          no other way. And thinking these things, I stumbled on Filliou’s sweet 
          formula</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">! &gt; 
            ? </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“surprise 
          is greater than questioning” and posted it on the wall here in 72-point 
          type because it made me just plain happy. And curious. I puzzle, laughing, 
          “how to obey?” this cheerful directive, this good-sounding and suggestive 
          statement. And see perhaps I’d “meant” it as the nifty condensary of your 
          neighbouring (and here I can say maybe anti-utopian) “generosity as method.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I might 
          have claimed your “unrecognizability” was the poetic we went in search 
          of writ large across syntax, form, even content. But I think what you’re 
          talking about is somehow the opposite. Not the welcome pleasure of defamiliarization 
          but the thing so unfamiliar you have no way of seeing it, let alone valuing 
          it. And/but which implicates the public and implies responsibility.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My only 
          way to think this extreme-seeming difficulty is to posit evolution again 
          and suggest that unrecognizability is never total and that it is desire 
          that creates adaptions—leaving us only impatience to deal with! It’s that 
          implicated, fundamental. Always happening, in whatever arena. Can a poetics 
          which puts its attention on Levinas— “distension,” the “bond” with the 
          “incontrovertible,” recognize (without “converting”) the unrecognizable, 
          I wonder? And is the genuinely public space necessarily “generous” in 
          this manner? I mean without even trying to be? How amend editorial practice 
          to ensure unrecognizability its opportunity? Is it impossible? Or just 
          scary? ... And so every little organism gets to find out how inertia and 
          fear operate on the planet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I know that 
          in the days when this “unrecognizability” was a gender issue, Louky Bersianik’s 
          <i>L’Euguelionne</i> suggested the folly of confrontational engagement 
          with the oppositional structures we wanted to leave behind (her formula 
          might have been “.!&gt;?” or, “the surprising and emphatic restatement 
          of self/gender is greater than questioning the status quo on its own terms”). 
          Enactment of self “as if”—however one could conceive that “as if”— and 
          especially the reclaiming of pleasure constituted her persuasive formula 
          for change. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, I am 
          trying to “be unfamiliar with what I am doing” (Cage) and it’s, of course, 
          hard! Can welcome make visible something unforeseen (your “unrecognisable”?) 
          I wonder. Say We is walking to a party without a gift and suddenly realizes 
          that the street is full of gifts. He’s still We. And the “gift” he picks 
          up is dependent on it. And this is ground we’ve been over before....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">No answers; 
          but I do want to acknowledge Roy Miki’s work for unrecognizability in 
          Canada in <i>West Coast Line</i> and to point to <i>Chain</i>’s wonderful 
          systemic refusal of certain forms of editorial choice coupled with their

          “Step out of the historical trains which ain’t going nowhere, are sure

          of nowhere, to begin—to see....” (Susan Clark, <i>Raddle Moon</i> 13)

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As <i>Raddle 
          moon</i> has had a number of co-editors and assistant and contributing 
          editors through the years, I’ve used “I” and “we” fairly loosely throughout 
          this piece. Past co-editors are Kathryn MacLeod, Catriona Strang, Lisa 
          Robertson; past associate editors are Steven Forth and Vivian Marple; 
          present contributing editors are Norma Cole, Erin Mouré, Nicole Brossard, 
          and Lisa Robertson. The magazine’s existence, shape and mentalité owe 
          a lot to all of them and to Christine Stewart, Michael and Sally Gregson, 
          and Colin Smith. </font></p>
