        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">[a] book, 
          even a fragmentary one, has a centre which attracts it. This centre 
          is not fixed but is displaced by the pressure of the book and circumstances 
          of its composition. Yet it is also a fixed centre which, if it is genuine, 
          displaces itself, while remaining the same and becoming always more 
          central, more hidden, more uncertain and more imperious. He who writes 
          the book writes it out of desire for this centre and out of ignorance.

        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It has 
          long been said that the desert is monotheistic. Is it illogical or devoid 
          of interest to observe that the district in Paris between Place de la

          and to the disorientation of habitual reflexes? [...] Psychogeography 
          could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects 
          of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the 
          emotions and behaviour of individuals. — Debord, <i>Les Lèvres Nues

      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Can I say 
        that out of desire for just this “uncertain,” “displaced,” “fixed” and 
        unfixed booklike centre, and out of ignorance of that centre, <i>Raddle 
        moon </i>is a kind of psychogeography which rightly resists description 
        (incl. my own) but which draws the work which belongs to it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I started 
        to write this thing, as you all know, in the belief that <i>Raddle moon 
        </i>had always been suspicious of pre-emptive self-description, of “platforms”; 
        wanted (from survival instinct) to stay out the way of certain historicizing 
        machines that prefab’d and demo’d them, wanted to believe the magazine 
        had always declared its intentions quite simply by enacting them, etc. 
        etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Wanted to 
        make a space, not take a stand. That. (Realizing that that “that” may 
        relate partly to our history, which I’ve tried to write for Charles.) 
        So, <i>Raddle moon </i>as psychogeography—a haunted, porous “no-place,” 
        implicated but motile, built of little but the trace of the work that’s 
        appeared there “agglomerative, bulgy, made and unmade” what I’ve called 
        a “utopia of shoddy upkeep,” despairing of time, money and energy—at least 
        seems something I recognize, know.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Utopia: 
        “In this vested, gendered, entirely fraught medium, the real question 
        is what is being celebrated” (Laura Moriarty, in the Women/Writing/Theory 
        colloquium in <i>Raddle Moon</i> 11) and “The state had come to us fragmentary. 
        Our writing was unavoidable” (Norma Cole, <i>ibid,</i> ditto) for instance. 
        An unpocketable and disheveled field, Possibility. Blanchot’s book, unfinished 
        over and over again each issue, each work contributing to the “pull” of 
        that more and more complexly informed, even demanding (“imperious”), centre 
        that brings the work towards it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If <i>Raddle 
        moon </i>is that psychogeography made of the trace of writers and artists 
        across it and by the temporary local coherences they’ve made (am I going 
        to call that effect “community” in a moment?) it is this space that attracts 
        our future work profoundly. And by future work, I don’t just mean work 
        that’s out there and might think <i>Raddle moon </i>an appropriate venue. 
        I mean work that hasn’t been written yet. And of course I think a lot 
        about women’s work here. Like any editor, I know how difficult it still 
        is to bring out women’s work. Proust said don’t be afraid to go too far 
        because that’s where the real work is. If I’m going to be utopian, I’m 
        going to say that’s the psychogeography I aspire to: the place where writers, 
        especially women, feel they can go “too far.” </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, ok, 
        <i>it’s my job </i>as editor to be utopian! (if for no other reason than 
        because, as Erin so succinctly puts it, How else?) But if a “no-place” 
        which will make future work, in some sense, possible is all I care about 
        these days, I can’t say I’m yet clear about how to get there. Struggling 
        with a number of, for me, unworkable notions of what it is a magazine 
        does over the years (all that early roaming the world in search of new 
        poetic means was necessary, perhaps, who knows) allowed me finally to 
        recognize what courage the very existence of a periodical like Kathleen 
        Fraser’s <i>HOW(ever)</i>—which I first saw years after hearing about 
        it, and becoming aware of its effects—could give and how courage became 
        new thought and new work. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Tish</i>—the 
        great Canadian example of exactly this in my own backyard—seemed more 
        distant in time, gender and (so I then thought) poetics. So I didn’t get 
        to see “it” happen close up until around 1989, when <i>Barscheit</i> (Christine 
        Stewart, Catriona Strang, Lisa Robertson, eds.) occurred. Its very ephemerality 
        (printed on hijacked equipment and “borrowed” paper, disseminated for 
        free, and quickly), the sense of its constant immanence—there was no publishing 
        schedule, so at any moment there could be a <i>Barscheit</i>—and its guerrilla-style 
        protest against the silencing of unfashionable poetry/poetics (an unspoken 
        editorial policy being to print works which would be rejected at this 
        or that other magazine—in the same way <i>Tish</i> saw itself publishing 
        what <i>Prism</i> couldn’t accept) made a literal space, an opening; found 
        and amplified what Norma often calls a “conversation” and got it within 
        earshot of others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So: that’s 
        a use. While I was figuring this out, of course, everything changed. Cyberspace 
        makes a small-circulation, booklike magazine look a very strange way of 
        finding like minds, and a certainly clumsy way of making a relational 
        context for varied works of writing and image. (I look at Laura’s glorious 
        online <i>non<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup> [1] </sup></a></i> and regret the sad weight of 
        the physical world! Can these bulky ephemerals, largely scorned after 
        their period is up, any longer justify being printed in sweat, trees and 
        wheelbarrowloads of cash? When they’re landfill the back issues of <i>non</i> 
        will be behind a click-icon, ever-present.) Delight in the object (still 
        evident in new beauties like <i>The Germ, Boxkite, Rhizome, </i>among 
        others)—and an ever more capacious web site—is my defence, for now.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Re: l’archivisme, 
        or “the circumstance of its composition”</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You kindly 
        as ever get in the way of my cramped impulse to throw the past out. (“When 
        I see the word ‘positioning,’ I vomit”) So, how to speak this history? 
        In many ways, it now seems to me the record of an exploration of the use 
        of public space. Therefore the record of my/our gradually shifting understandings 
        of that space. Like a city of invisible but potent—or nicely temporary, 
        but potent—architecture. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, what 
        happened here? Well, <i>Raddle moon </i>published its first issue as <i>The 
        raddle moon</i> Feb.14.84 as a 6”x 9” perfectbound booklike object of 
        about 100 pages ostensibly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the University 
        of Victoria’s Creative Writing Department. Born—in our minds—out of sheer 
        desire to make “something where there was nothing” (as Melissa says) in 
        a fairly primitive, if urgent, sense.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Truth is, 
        publishing up a wobbly literary from within a university writing department 
        need not be a carefully deliberated act. The magazine answered a particular 
        moment of available tools: departmental money; a computer; a background 
        in book editing and publishing; friendship (most importantly with Kathryn 
        MacLeod, with whom I edited the first four issues); stubbornness, energy 
        and a sense of “leaving home” aesthetically (predictably, our relationship 
        with the university didn’t last beyond the first issue).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Behind that 
        energy was the compulsion Kathryn and I felt to force open a window under 
        threat of suffocation in the stale party atmosphere of the done-to-death 
        Canadian Content drive which only a decade earlier had come as a genuinely 
        liberating force. As our manifesto in the third issue put it: “Perhaps 
        because we come from an island ourselves and recognize the symptoms, we 
        begin to see Canada as a tiny isolate land. And feel, nationally, ‘bushed’. 
        We notice that our drawers are stuffed with airmail stationery.” Or, you 
        might say perceived limitation (“perhaps we are just greedy: the plateful 
        in front of us not big enough for our eyes” the same editorial continues) 
        manifested an extreme desire which in turn catalysed adaptive evolutionary 
        changes (as some say species’ desire does). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We were 
        at the end of those glory days of the ’60s and ’70s when the small press 
        publishers in Canada—Talonbooks, Anansi, Coach House, etc.—had birthed 
        and unearthed a new national literature and urged us all in large-character 
        posters to READ CANADIAN. We were kids, but a slightly older generation 
        of practicing poets had found out mid-career what it was like to read, 
        write and publish Here, not There (not Britain, not the USA). Life was 
        fine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For those 
        of us still in highschool—to chart the <i>absolute</i> history of <i>Raddle 
        moon</i>, but also of the country—it had meant that by 1969, our 24-year-old 
        English teacher knew it was important to read Phyllis Webb’s recent <i>Naked 
        Poems</i> to her class of fifteen-year-olds....Here, suddenly (3:30pm, 
        Wednesday, in the bleak cold “New Wing”) for some unknown reason, were 
        these miracles of deft, ironic sureness, this Raven-like trickster, shimmering 
        with an unblinking, self-conscious intelligence, opened to paradox, the 
        political, the sexual and language itself. Here, for some unknown reason, 
        was this woman, this Canadian, thinking aloud in a way we’d never known 
        a human to think or speak. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But CanLit 
        turned out to contain no other Phyllis Webbs. It was a small literature, 
        after all, no matter how urgently and famously it was boiling up all around. 
        Ten years later, predictably, we didn’t get what we’d been given and you 
        could say we were bored. Young writers we knew tended to read nothing 
        but the same few Canadians—if they read at all (that Salinger “purity” 
        model). Of course there was a lot else going on in Canada we didn’t know 
        about and might not have recognized if we had. Of course, of course. It 
        must have been very different in Vancouver—<i>Tish</i> being the evidence—where 
        the Black Mountain feed had come in, but the ocean’s quite a moat, you 
        know, and by the late seventies, at least in Victoria, it was getting 
        a bit difficult to breathe. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, restlessness, 
        comradeship, and a budget morphed <i>From An Island</i> (which <i>Raddle 
        moon </i>officially replaced) into a kind of “to-an-island”—an import 
        rather than an export model. And for the first few issues, we had editors 
        in places as far off-centre as possible: north of 60 (the promised multi-layered 
        Inuit sound poetry turned out to be impossible to translate, and sacred), 
        Haifa, Florence, Africa, Japan. And the name to name this: “moon marked 
        with red ochre,” “earth as moon made of (red) earth”—in fact, three words 
        we liked as a sound, a little prosody exercise.         </font></p>

      <p class=quot><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        relationship with alterity is the original case of this affliction of 
        the present of consciousness with a past that it cannot render present, 
        represent. The present is afflicted with a bond with something that comes 
        to pass without being convertible into an initiative of the present, and 
        that holds on, and in this hold distends one.  — Levinas</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’ve been 
        reading your conversation with Yedda Morrison in <i>Tripwire,</i> hearing 
        you saying things like, “For me, where I can say <i>politicize</i> I have 
        to say the word <i>generosity</i>. Implicit in being political is trying 
        to restore the human face.” And my attention’s caught by your mention 
        of the problem of “unrecognizability.”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I’ve been 
        thinking about “use” and “sufficiency” (re: <i>Raddle moon</i>, re: whatever 
        publication; re: public spaces) and about evolution’s both adaptive and 
        unforeseen solutions to life-threatening situations and how these are 
        different from the revolutionary (revolving) solutions proposed by certain 
        aesthetics and how much attention I’ve given them, thinking there was 
        no other way. And thinking these things, I stumbled on Filliou’s sweet 
        formula</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">! &gt; 
          ? </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">“surprise 
        is greater than questioning” and posted it on the wall here in 72-point 
        type because it made me just plain happy. And curious. I puzzle, laughing, 
        “how to obey?” this cheerful directive, this good-sounding and suggestive 
        statement. And see perhaps I’d “meant” it as the nifty condensary of your 
        neighbouring (and here I can say maybe anti-utopian) “generosity as method.”</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I might 
        have claimed your “unrecognizability” was the poetic we went in search 
        of writ large across syntax, form, even content. But I think what you’re 
        talking about is somehow the opposite. Not the welcome pleasure of defamiliarization 
        but the thing so unfamiliar you have no way of seeing it, let alone valuing 
        it. And/but which implicates the public and implies responsibility.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My only 
        way to think this extreme-seeming difficulty is to posit evolution again 
        and suggest that unrecognizability is never total and that it is desire 
        that creates adaptions—leaving us only impatience to deal with! It’s that 
        implicated, fundamental. Always happening, in whatever arena. Can a poetics 
        which puts its attention on Levinas— “distension,” the “bond” with the 
        “incontrovertible,” recognize (without “converting”) the unrecognizable, 
        I wonder? And is the genuinely public space necessarily “generous” in 
        this manner? I mean without even trying to be? How amend editorial practice 
        to ensure unrecognizability its opportunity? Is it impossible? Or just 
        scary? ... And so every little organism gets to find out how inertia and 
        fear operate on the planet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I know that 
        in the days when this “unrecognizability” was a gender issue, Louky Bersianik’s 
        <i>L’Euguelionne</i> suggested the folly of confrontational engagement 
        with the oppositional structures we wanted to leave behind (her formula 
        might have been “.!&gt;?” or, “the surprising and emphatic restatement 
        of self/gender is greater than questioning the status quo on its own terms”). 
        Enactment of self “as if”—however one could conceive that “as if”— and 
        especially the reclaiming of pleasure constituted her persuasive formula 
        for change. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, I am 
        trying to “be unfamiliar with what I am doing” (Cage) and it’s, of course, 
        hard! Can welcome make visible something unforeseen (your “unrecognisable”?) 
        I wonder. Say We is walking to a party without a gift and suddenly realizes 
        that the street is full of gifts. He’s still We. And the “gift” he picks 
        up is dependent on it. And this is ground we’ve been over before....</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">No answers; 
        but I do want to acknowledge Roy Miki’s work for unrecognizability in 
        Canada in <i>West Coast Line</i> and to point to <i>Chain</i>’s wonderful 
        systemic refusal of certain forms of editorial choice coupled with their 
        investigation of somewhat parallel writing strategies—collaborations, 
        programmatic writing.  </font></p>

        “editing as [thinking as] space surrounds buildings”? It’s certainly something 
        to do with space.<br>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As <i>Raddle 
        moon</i> has had a number of co-editors and assistant and contributing 
        editors through the years, I’ve used “I” and “we” fairly loosely throughout 
        this piece. Past co-editors are Kathryn MacLeod, Catriona Strang, Lisa 
        Robertson; past associate editors are Steven Forth and Vivian Marple; 
        present contributing editors are Norma Cole, Erin Mouré, Nicole Brossard, 
        and Lisa Robertson. The magazine’s existence, shape and mentalité owe 
        a lot to all of them and to Christine Stewart, Michael and Sally Gregson, 
        and Colin Smith. </font></p>
