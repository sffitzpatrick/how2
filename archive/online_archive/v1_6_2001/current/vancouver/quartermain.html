      <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
        are the myths of daughtership and the father-daughter relationship? What 
        is one daughter’s experience in the context of these? Can the daughter’s 
        words ever be understood by the father, or are the language of the father 
        and language of the daughter too radically separated by distinct social 
        experience? Why must a daughter who has answered the first question No 
        go back and face the crypt? These are the starting points of my explorations 
        in <i>I Came Bearing Bears</i>. Then, further, I wonder, how is the father-daughter 
        relationship paralleled by colonization between nations and patriarchal 
        hierarchies of knowledge and power? Is there a sense of aboriginal being 
        outside these hierarchies or must this remain a dream? The text explores 
        an amoebic psychological landscape that stretches between Dublin and various 
        points across Canada and between younger and older versions of the narrator, 
        who invents something she calls Willow Language as a sort of companion 
        in this venture. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        passage included in <i>How2</i> is the opening of the novel. At a later 
        point in the following passage (which appeared this year in <i>on word</i> 
        in England), I found I had stated metaphorically some of the nature of 
        my exploration, my poetic praxis and my sense of how language is deployed 
        and received: </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The newsstand 
          bloke takes my punts and returns Irish coins, each one carrying miniature 
          Tara harps with horses, stags, bulls, fish, and herons. I pocket the 
          harps and animals, then set out toward the river researching my fatherworld, 
          Father Freud, Father Marx and Father Darwin, fathers of consciousness, 
          fathers of unconsciousness. Like a Jacques Cartier Coureur de Bois, 
          I deploy snowshoes, ropes, canoes, theodolites and transits from my 
          station of assigned coordinates to measure distances in a succession 
          of lines known as traverses, to take bearings that I cosign in the trigonometry 
          of angulated plots. To account for the basic shapes of earth in the 
          convergence of true north meridians, I must also know property law. 
          But although simple relief of the terrain's configuration seems impossible, 
          perhaps I can untie the contour lines of readable pictures, showing 
          true elevations of dams, bridges, tunnels, canals, transmission lines 
          and sewers, moving further and further from shore where the soundings 
          are muddier and finally the ocean in infinite.</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
        At the same time, in other writings, I was becoming intensely aware of 
        the way words buzz with a sensibility outside their denotative dictionary 
        meanings—a kind of tactile harmonics that I could compose in landscapes 
        of rhythm, motion and texture.  The words buzz like bees, and these buzzings 
        invoke the shamans of our being.  So powerful are they that our schooling 
        devotes 12 to 20 years teaching us to suppress them in our reading strategies. <br>

      <p align=left><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">From 
        <i>I Came Bearing Bears, a Novel (</i>manuscript)</font></b></p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
      <p>You asked me about my father, so I will tell you.  He died of cancer, 
        probably not very quickly.  I don’t know.  I wasn’t there.  About six 
        years before, someone wrote a note to me that he’d been diagnosed.  I 
        didn’t write back.  </p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Seventeen 
        years before his death was the last time I spoke to him.  He’d sent one 
        of his cryptic notes, which said “I take full responsibility for what 
        happened.”  What <i>had</i> happened, I wonder.  I filed the note away 
        as evidence of murder.  Then, he telephoned me.  The last thing I said 
        to him on the phone was, No, there’s no point.  We speak different languages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Silence 
        was the only answer.  The language of the father was not the language 
        of the daughter.  Maybe because language is ultimately a private event.  
        Incommensurable spaces gape between us.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But then 
        who am I and who are you but people I invent?  Where is the territory 
        of I and the territory of you?  The territory of father and the territory 
        of daughter? The territory of Irish and the territory of Canadian?  You 
        have a literary address: Leopold Bloom, Ireland.  I address you as Mr. 
        Bloom.  Like you I spent a day in Dublin only mine was October 31 whereas 
        yours was June 16, and then of course you went on living there with your 
        wife Molly and your daughter Milly and your son Rudy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My father, 
        too, is an invention, a literary address, and I am another one.  You could 
        say I went in search of these addresses in the General Post Office in 
        Dublin and then in the General Post Office of memory—it too having war 
        memorials for its declarations of independence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To Ireland.  
        To the land of Ire.  Of murder and love and mourning.  To the land of 
        Ire on a flying bus called RyanAir which gave me the last seat on a bank 
        holiday weekend, the plane packed with rowdy college students laughing 
        and joking in the back rows so the stewardess with her stockinged legs 
        and her blond hair coming a little unpinned had to stop the safety announcement 
        like a peremptory nanny and wait for sh sh sh to go round, then start 
        up again about exits and air masks and diagrams in seat pockets and then 
        stop,  sh sh sh, and start over.  My return from the land of Ire—impossible—the 
        man from Stena Steamship I spoke to by telephone insisting I had to get 
        to Dublin and book it in person.  <i>Yes normally people just arrive and 
        walk on to the ferries but for Canadians we have different rules.  I don’t 
        believe this speech you have offered me about master cards, I insist on 
        seeing your real body</i>.  The telephone itself a sinister network of 
        harmonic ferries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I arrived, 
        I didn’t really know much about you.  I’d heard of course.  You are rather 
        famous, you and your ancient namesake.  You pointed out a Martello tower, 
        but it wasn’t till much later that I realized the significance of this 
        to you and even now this significance is truly impossible for me to capture—this 
        sense of a landmark in literature and imagination, this home of a struggling 
        lion of letters, a father of literature, who set out to write an epic 
        ironically depicting all that made life an epically unepic paralysis.  
        Instead, at the time, what I saw was something that looked like a small 
        round cement fortress clinging to a cliff above the sea and when you said 
        these towers were built to fight Napoleonic invasions I immediately pictured 
        our bunkers in Stanley Park in Vancouver, built to ward off Japanese invasions 
        in the second world war.  Dublin was under construction, the site of an 
        odyssey in the father language, an odd thing – an odd fish-line hurled 
        in a higgledy piggledy loop—of invasions, bunkers and fortresses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My guidebook 
        was quite clear about where to find you in the brass plaques in the streets.  
        One of them mentioned you had experienced a “puffball of smoke” coming 
        from a barge on the river.   Another said you smelled “mockturtle vapour 
        and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly” from Harrison’s Restaurant, which 
        was still there on the east side of Westmoreland Street.  Every year by 
        following these plaques people retrace their hero’s footsteps.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I begin 
        to trace my footsteps.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You dropped 
        me off at Clontarf DART Station which wasn’t on my tourist map.  The DART 
        was not darting.  The gates were closed, the ticket office closed, people 
        were leaping the turnstiles anyway.  Polite Canadian that I am, I hesitated 
        until someone unlatched the sidegate.  Headlines pursued me.  Canadian 
        arrested for fraudulent ride on Dublin transit system, polite Canadian 
        always in transit.  Please purchase your ticket at destination, a sign 
        said.  But signs must be interpreted.  Very well, I would not be arrested 
        on my only day in Dublin.  I got off two stops later at Tara Station.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
          harp that once through Tara’s halls<br>
          </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
          soul of music shed<br>
          </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Now 
          hangs as mute on Tara’s walls<br>
          </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>As 
          if that soul were fled.</i></font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Little did 
        I know then how far I would have to search for Tara and my harp.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New R0oman, Times, serif" size="3">A couple 
        of blokes stood at the exit gate lurking in their guard cage—there is 
        no Canadian word for bloke as we don’t have them in Canada, or at least 
        not in Vancouver, or at least not enough of them to qualify for a word.  
        Maybe we need more football or soccer matches, or maybe we need to import 
        the word <i>bloke</i> so that heavy-set, sheepish-looking males relentlessly 
        external to the internet in a world of electronic signs, will have a place 
        to live, a website as it were.  The plight of the bloke is mine, polite 
        Canadian without a ticket.  Or is it? Maybe I’ve got too much of a website—a 
        daughter site I long to escape from,  a father site I want to claim with 
        murderous ambition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The guard 
        blokes are talking among themselves and hardly notice my non-existent 
        ticket.  When they do, they laugh.  Over there, they gesture past the 
        guard station to the ticket booth.  Polite Canadian purchases ticket and 
        brings it back to blokes.  This time they seem really puzzled.  Like why 
        did I come back?  The one who seems more on duty rather than his friend 
        who seems to be there mainly for blokish company takes the ticket, looks 
        at both sides.  Why don’t you keep it, he says, Use it on the way back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I crossed 
        a bridge and walked along Eden Quay, on the lookout for snakes of course 
        and naked men and women with figleaves.  I began to search for a cafe 
        that the guidebook said was an essential Dublin experience—a Bewley’s 
        oriental cafe.  Was it run by Chinese, I wondered in a silly way.  Amazing 
        that any of these signposts convey anything.  Could a Canadian be oriental 
        in Dublin?  I walked past the statue at the foot of O’Connell Street and 
        up O’Connell Street through the columns of the Post Office.  But of course 
        I couldn’t find a Bewley’s.  Some say only the unexpected arrives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Daniel O’Connell 
        towering over the broad boulevard of O’Connell Street across from Burgerking 
        <i>formed the bold design of combining the Irish Catholic millions, under 
        the superintendence of the native priesthood, into a vast league against 
        the existing order of things</i> – the bold design of claiming back the 
        Irish Republic.  Yes!  This is it.  I hurl out my fish-line to the vast 
        league against the existing order of things.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Walk bricks 
        and stones in the arches, spires, cornices and architraves of Dublin in 
        the land of Ire.  Walk up Henry Street, turn to narrow side streets till 
        I find a cafe for breakfast.  A small  plain storefront full of ordinary 
        people drinking coffee and smoking, unlike the grand cafe I’d passed up 
        along the way with its revolving doors, quaint bentwood chairs and marble 
        tables, huge windows from which to see and be seen by passersby on the 
        busy street, and also a huge line-up at the self-service counter.  Which 
        do you think would be more authentic, Mr. Bloom, for the “Dublin effect”?  
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And who 
        are ordinary people?  In my back-street cafe they wear mainly straight-cut 
        black or dark clothes.  Pale and slender with spines like curving willow 
        branches, two young girls serve the customers.  The willow girls, I hail 
        them silently, hunch over their notepads.  Their jeans and aprons are 
        black.  Their T-shirts white fading to gray.  A large sign says toilets 
        are for customers only.  Whereas, in the grand cafe of my memory people 
        are wearing beige or brown wool with dashes of orange, purple or green 
        as they mill about display cases of savories.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My father 
        wanted to be something more than ordinary, something as significant as 
        a Leopold Bloom—someone with a Bloom effect.  I address this from the 
        boonies of Vancouver on the west coast of British Columbia.  I address 
        this from beyond the pale—in the low-income housing projects down by the 
        Vancouver dockyards—their washed-out brick, their yellow doors, their 
        turquoise pipe railings.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A figure 
        approaches me, coat open to a spreading bulge of abdomen, button across 
        it pulling on flaps of white-faded-to-gray shirt, exposing a V of hairless 
        chest skin—man or woman, hard to say, yellowy gray wave of hair sprawled 
        from a side parting across the head and down below the ears, in tired 
        tendrils, the way you see in some aging rancher or bartender.  The figure 
        approaches, face sallow, eyes sagging, walk drifting.  The figure approaches 
        Hope abandoned—the boundary of Hope and Hopeless, sense and senseless.  
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some people 
        give up, I guess.  Then, some invent themselves as one who’s just between 
        jobs.  Jobs give workers ground to stand on—give workers themselves.  
        Just as the roulette wheel gives the gambler the gambler.  Just as heroin 
        gives the user a charming wit.  Just as words give the writer the writer 
        and the reader the reader.  Just as the father gives the daughter the 
        daughter.  And the daughter gives the father the father.  The murderee, 
        the murderer.  Which shall I be?  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Can one 
        ever cease to invent one’s self?  Apart from death?</font></p>
