        <p style='line-height:200%;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
          are the myths of daughtership and the father-daughter relationship? What 
          is one daughter’s experience in the context of these? Can the daughter’s 
          words ever be understood by the father, or are the language of the father 
          and language of the daughter too radically separated by distinct social 
          experience? Why must a daughter who has answered the first question No 
          go back and face the crypt? These are the starting points of my explorations 
          in <i>I Came Bearing Bears</i>. Then, further, I wonder, how is the father-daughter 
          relationship paralleled by colonization between nations and patriarchal 
          hierarchies of knowledge and power? Is there a sense of aboriginal being 
          outside these hierarchies or must this remain a dream? The text explores 
          an amoebic psychological landscape that stretches between Dublin and various 
          points across Canada and between younger and older versions of the narrator, 
          who invents something she calls Willow Language as a sort of companion 
          in this venture. </font></p>
        <p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
          passage included in <i>How2</i> is the opening of the novel. At a later 
          point in the following passage (which appeared this year in <i>on word</i> 
          in England), I found I had stated metaphorically some of the nature of 
          my exploration, my poetic praxis and my sense of how language is deployed 
          and received: </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The newsstand 
            bloke takes my punts and returns Irish coins, each one carrying miniature 
            Tara harps with horses, stags, bulls, fish, and herons. I pocket the 
            harps and animals, then set out toward the river researching my fatherworld, 
            Father Freud, Father Marx and Father Darwin, fathers of consciousness, 
            fathers of unconsciousness. Like a Jacques Cartier Coureur de Bois, 
            I deploy snowshoes, ropes, canoes, theodolites and transits from my 
            station of assigned coordinates to measure distances in a succession 
            of lines known as traverses, to take bearings that I cosign in the trigonometry 
            of angulated plots. To account for the basic shapes of earth in the 
            convergence of true north meridians, I must also know property law. 
            But although simple relief of the terrain's configuration seems impossible, 
            perhaps I can untie the contour lines of readable pictures, showing 
            true elevations of dams, bridges, tunnels, canals, transmission lines 
            and sewers, moving further and further from shore where the soundings 
            are muddier and finally the ocean in infinite.</font> </p>

          At the same time, in other writings, I was becoming intensely aware of 
          the way words buzz with a sensibility outside their denotative dictionary 
          meanings—a kind of tactile harmonics that I could compose in landscapes 
          of rhythm, motion and texture.  The words buzz like bees, and these buzzings 
          invoke the shamans of our being.  So powerful are they that our schooling 
          devotes 12 to 20 years teaching us to suppress them in our reading strategies. <br>

        <p align=left><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">From 
          <i>I Came Bearing Bears, a Novel (</i>manuscript)</font></b></p>
        <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
        <p>You asked me about my father, so I will tell you.  He died of cancer, 
          probably not very quickly.  I don’t know.  I wasn’t there.  About six 
          years before, someone wrote a note to me that he’d been diagnosed.  I 
          didn’t write back.  </p>
        </font> 
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Seventeen 
          years before his death was the last time I spoke to him.  He’d sent one 
          of his cryptic notes, which said “I take full responsibility for what 
          happened.”  What <i>had</i> happened, I wonder.  I filed the note away 
          as evidence of murder.  Then, he telephoned me.  The last thing I said 
          to him on the phone was, No, there’s no point.  We speak different languages.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Silence 
          was the only answer.  The language of the father was not the language 
          of the daughter.  Maybe because language is ultimately a private event.  
          Incommensurable spaces gape between us.  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But then 
          who am I and who are you but people I invent?  Where is the territory 
          of I and the territory of you?  The territory of father and the territory 
          of daughter? The territory of Irish and the territory of Canadian?  You 
          have a literary address: Leopold Bloom, Ireland.  I address you as Mr. 
          Bloom.  Like you I spent a day in Dublin only mine was October 31 whereas 
          yours was June 16, and then of course you went on living there with your 
          wife Molly and your daughter Milly and your son Rudy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My father, 
          too, is an invention, a literary address, and I am another one.  You could 
          say I went in search of these addresses in the General Post Office in 
          Dublin and then in the General Post Office of memory—it too having war 
          memorials for its declarations of independence.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To Ireland.  
          To the land of Ire.  Of murder and love and mourning.  To the land of 
          Ire on a flying bus called RyanAir which gave me the last seat on a bank 
          holiday weekend, the plane packed with rowdy college students laughing 
          and joking in the back rows so the stewardess with her stockinged legs 
          and her blond hair coming a little unpinned had to stop the safety announcement 
          like a peremptory nanny and wait for sh sh sh to go round, then start 
          up again about exits and air masks and diagrams in seat pockets and then 
          stop,  sh sh sh, and start over.  My return from the land of Ire—impossible—the 
          man from Stena Steamship I spoke to by telephone insisting I had to get 
          to Dublin and book it in person.  <i>Yes normally people just arrive and 
          walk on to the ferries but for Canadians we have different rules.  I don’t 
          believe this speech you have offered me about master cards, I insist on 
          seeing your real body</i>.  The telephone itself a sinister network of 
          harmonic ferries.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I arrived, 
          I didn’t really know much about you.  I’d heard of course.  You are rather 
          famous, you and your ancient namesake.  You pointed out a Martello tower, 
          but it wasn’t till much later that I realized the significance of this 
          to you and even now this significance is truly impossible for me to capture—this 
          sense of a landmark in literature and imagination, this home of a struggling 
          lion of letters, a father of literature, who set out to write an epic 
          ironically depicting all that made life an epically unepic paralysis.  
          Instead, at the time, what I saw was something that looked like a small 
          round cement fortress clinging to a cliff above the sea and when you said 
          these towers were built to fight Napoleonic invasions I immediately pictured 
          our bunkers in Stanley Park in Vancouver, built to ward off Japanese invasions 
          in the second world war.  Dublin was under construction, the site of an 
          odyssey in the father language, an odd thing – an odd fish-line hurled 
          in a higgledy piggledy loop—of invasions, bunkers and fortresses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My guidebook 
          was quite clear about where to find you in the brass plaques in the streets.  
          One of them mentioned you had experienced a “puffball of smoke” coming 
          from a barge on the river.   Another said you smelled “mockturtle vapour 
          and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly” from Harrison’s Restaurant, which 
          was still there on the east side of Westmoreland Street.  Every year by 
          following these plaques people retrace their hero’s footsteps.  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I begin 
          to trace my footsteps.  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You dropped 
          me off at Clontarf DART Station which wasn’t on my tourist map.  The DART 
          was not darting.  The gates were closed, the ticket office closed, people 
          were leaping the turnstiles anyway.  Polite Canadian that I am, I hesitated 
          until someone unlatched the sidegate.  Headlines pursued me.  Canadian 
          arrested for fraudulent ride on Dublin transit system, polite Canadian 
          always in transit.  Please purchase your ticket at destination, a sign 
          said.  But signs must be interpreted.  Very well, I would not be arrested 
          on my only day in Dublin.  I got off two stops later at Tara Station.</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
            harp that once through Tara’s halls<br>
            </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
            soul of music shed<br>
            </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Now 
            hangs as mute on Tara’s walls<br>
            </i></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>As 
            if that soul were fled.</i></font> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Little did 
          I know then how far I would have to search for Tara and my harp.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New R0oman, Times, serif" size="3">A couple 
          of blokes stood at the exit gate lurking in their guard cage—there is 
          no Canadian word for bloke as we don’t have them in Canada, or at least 
          not in Vancouver, or at least not enough of them to qualify for a word.  
          Maybe we need more football or soccer matches, or maybe we need to import 
          the word <i>bloke</i> so that heavy-set, sheepish-looking males relentlessly 
          external to the internet in a world of electronic signs, will have a place 
          to live, a website as it were.  The plight of the bloke is mine, polite 
          Canadian without a ticket.  Or is it? Maybe I’ve got too much of a website—a 
          daughter site I long to escape from,  a father site I want to claim with 
          murderous ambition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The guard 
          blokes are talking among themselves and hardly notice my non-existent 
          ticket.  When they do, they laugh.  Over there, they gesture past the 
          guard station to the ticket booth.  Polite Canadian purchases ticket and 
          brings it back to blokes.  This time they seem really puzzled.  Like why 
          did I come back?  The one who seems more on duty rather than his friend 
          who seems to be there mainly for blokish company takes the ticket, looks 
          at both sides.  Why don’t you keep it, he says, Use it on the way back.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I crossed 
          a bridge and walked along Eden Quay, on the lookout for snakes of course 
          and naked men and women with figleaves.  I began to search for a cafe 
          that the guidebook said was an essential Dublin experience—a Bewley’s 
          oriental cafe.  Was it run by Chinese, I wondered in a silly way.  Amazing 
          that any of these signposts convey anything.  Could a Canadian be oriental 
          in Dublin?  I walked past the statue at the foot of O’Connell Street and 
          up O’Connell Street through the columns of the Post Office.  But of course 
          I couldn’t find a Bewley’s.  Some say only the unexpected arrives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Daniel O’Connell 
          towering over the broad boulevard of O’Connell Street across from Burgerking 
          <i>formed the bold design of combining the Irish Catholic millions, under 
          the superintendence of the native priesthood, into a vast league against 
          the existing order of things</i> – the bold design of claiming back the 
          Irish Republic.  Yes!  This is it.  I hurl out my fish-line to the vast 
          league against the existing order of things.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Walk bricks 
          and stones in the arches, spires, cornices and architraves of Dublin in 
          the land of Ire.  Walk up Henry Street, turn to narrow side streets till 
          I find a cafe for breakfast.  A small  plain storefront full of ordinary 
          people drinking coffee and smoking, unlike the grand cafe I’d passed up 
          along the way with its revolving doors, quaint bentwood chairs and marble 
          tables, huge windows from which to see and be seen by passersby on the 
          busy street, and also a huge line-up at the self-service counter.  Which 
          do you think would be more authentic, Mr. Bloom, for the “Dublin effect”?  
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And who 
          are ordinary people?  In my back-street cafe they wear mainly straight-cut 
          black or dark clothes.  Pale and slender with spines like curving willow 
          branches, two young girls serve the customers.  The willow girls, I hail 
          them silently, hunch over their notepads.  Their jeans and aprons are 
          black.  Their T-shirts white fading to gray.  A large sign says toilets 
          are for customers only.  Whereas, in the grand cafe of my memory people 
          are wearing beige or brown wool with dashes of orange, purple or green 
          as they mill about display cases of savories.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My father 
          wanted to be something more than ordinary, something as significant as 
          a Leopold Bloom—someone with a Bloom effect.  I address this from the 
          boonies of Vancouver on the west coast of British Columbia.  I address 
          this from beyond the pale—in the low-income housing projects down by the 
          Vancouver dockyards—their washed-out brick, their yellow doors, their 
          turquoise pipe railings.  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A figure 
          approaches me, coat open to a spreading bulge of abdomen, button across 
          it pulling on flaps of white-faded-to-gray shirt, exposing a V of hairless 
          chest skin—man or woman, hard to say, yellowy gray wave of hair sprawled 
          from a side parting across the head and down below the ears, in tired 
          tendrils, the way you see in some aging rancher or bartender.  The figure 
          approaches, face sallow, eyes sagging, walk drifting.  The figure approaches 
          Hope abandoned—the boundary of Hope and Hopeless, sense and senseless.  
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some people 
          give up, I guess.  Then, some invent themselves as one who’s just between 
          jobs.  Jobs give workers ground to stand on—give workers themselves.  
          Just as the roulette wheel gives the gambler the gambler.  Just as heroin 
          gives the user a charming wit.  Just as words give the writer the writer 
          and the reader the reader.  Just as the father gives the daughter the 
          daughter.  And the daughter gives the father the father.  The murderee, 
          the murderer.  Which shall I be?  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Can one 
          ever cease to invent one’s self?  Apart from death?</font></p>
