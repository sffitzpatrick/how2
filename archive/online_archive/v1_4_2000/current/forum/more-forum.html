If, as psychoanalysis instructs us, gender difference               is born "in" language, and if, as common sense allows us, the law               of language has been "for centuries" "prescribed" (87) by men, then               the truly signifying female subject would seem an improbability.               Notes Irigaray (in the words of Jacques Lacan): "There is no woman               who is not excluded by the nature of things, which is the nature               of words..."

Subjected to the circular ratiocination through which               meaning is standardized by a compulsory logic that has already determined               it as such, woman presumably rests beneath and beyond "the real,"               inscribed within it only as the lack that guarantees its adequacy.&#9;               </font></p>            <p>             <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For               Irigaray, the answer to the conundrum of the woman who seeks to               mean lies in creatively seizing and appropriating her place of lawlessness.               Woman's lack, marked by her tenuous relationship to the process               of signification, is reimagined as excess; absence becomes omnipresence,               quiescence--chaos: "Is it already getting around&#151; [...] that               women diffuse themselves according to modalities scarcely compatible               with the framework of the ruling symbolics [?] Which doesn't happen               without causing some turbulence, we might even say some whirlwinds,..."               (106)</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When               I reflect upon my own experiences as a woman who speaks to mean               and means to write, I recall having effected a few whirlwinds of               my own. When a teenager, I was cautioned to modify my prose style,<b>               </b>whose program could best be characterized by a profusion of               adjectives (often grouped in threes), an obsession with the semicolon,               and an insistence upon never using a short word when a longer one               would do. Today, as I aspire to signify within the parameters of               the academy, my stabs at meaning are still deemed provocations by               those I ask to interpret them. My textual analyses, for example,               are sometimes called "dense" and insufficiently "logical." The legitimacy               and specificity of such critiques notwithstanding, I do wonder if               my style, as well as the stuff of which it is made, might be attributed               to something other than carelessness or idiosyncrasy. Am I, by dint               of my sex, a renegade apt to disrupt the<b> </b>stylistic and scholastic               conventions (the <i>laws</i>) of critical discourse?

Although I cannot verify               its author, I suspect it is the same young man who was, throughout               the tenure of my class, sullen, indifferent, and enamored of Goethe's               hero, Faust. If resistance precedes dominance, then perhaps to prattle--"to               talk (or write) much or idly," producing "the babble of a child"--is               divine.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now,               as I begin a dissertation about the relationship between beauty               and ethics in the poetics of the Harlem Renaissance, I am compelled               to acknowledge the difficulty, not simply of woman speaking, but               of woman speaking <i>beauty</i>. In her apologia for beauty, <i>On               Beauty and Being Just</i>, Elaine Scarry<b> </b>laments its banishment               from critical discourse. No longer <i>in style</i> within the halls               of contemporary academe, beauty is still spoken but only illicitly--"in               whispers." (57) A primary argument against beauty holds special               significance for the woman who would expound upon it: political               in nature, it asserts the burden of beauty for the woman wholly               reduced to it and sometimes, endangered when urged to fulfill the               desires it incites. (79) The gorgeous movie star is driven by unending               and demanding scrutiny to drown her pain in booze and pills. The               winsome school girl--robbed of her childhood by premature marriage...or               worse. With this in mind, I might be justifiably persuaded to discard               the discourse of beauty. Yet a less material, more formal narrative               of beauty allows me to complicate the notion that its mere articulation               hurts women.</font></p>            <p>             <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In               the eighteenth century, philosophers such as Immanuel Kant subdivided               "beauty" into two categories: the beautiful and the sublime. While               the sublime, thought "eternal," "principled," and "righteous," was               characterized as male, the beautiful, thought "small," "gay," and               "charming," was characterized as female and became, as Scarry relates,               "dismissible." (83-5) A counter to the political argument against               beauty here emerges; in contrast to a conventional feminist claim               that beauty is too grave for woman to bear, a conventional philosophical               line on beauty, epitomized<i> </i><u>in </u>woman, attributes to               it, an embarrassment of levity. If one adapts the Irigarayan innovation               of turning less into more, one can strain the qualities of beauty:               insignificance, gaiety, and charm to the celebration of "womanist"               superfluity and sorcery. Philosophically (and historically) speaking,               then, succumbing to an academic convention&#151;whether feminist               or misogynist&#151;by which beauty is to be abandoned, may be abandoning               both woman and the peculiar expressivity she makes possible. </font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ultimately,               we women come to the pleasure of withstanding and reshaping given               <i>formats</i> of meaning (no matter from whom they derive). But               can we not come to the pleasure of <i>form</i>? For in decrying               the phallogocentrism of mainstream signification, Irigaray likewise               decries "form," which she counts among an entire set of "values               promulgated by patriarchal society and culture, values inscribed               in the philosophical corpus..." (86) Irigaray's misrepresentation               of "form" derives from her narrow interpretation of the "law" to               which it bears resemblance&#150;a move strengthened by her conflation               of patriarchy with philosophy. Because she focuses solely on philosophy's               seemingly masculinist<b> </b>predilection for transcendent objectivity,               she ignores what it gives rise to in the way of improvisation and               particularism. By turning again to the controversial discourse of               beauty, I can revise Irigaray's narrative of form, which likens               it to a normalizing "judgement" dictating the course of "nature"               (107) and, in the process, challenge both her traditional characterization               and her implicit gendering of law.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In               philosophy, judgement, what Kant calls the "middle term between               understanding and reason," posits no special law with regard to               the nature of things but only, a "principle peculiar to itself upon               which law [is] <i>sought.</i>" (15) The offspring of judgement,               aesthetic judgement, whose specific job it is to divine beauty,               has an even more nuanced relationship to the real, for it does not               even seek "knowledge" of a thing but simply yields to the <i>form</i><u>               </u>that marks its crystallization "<i>within</i><u> </u>a subject"               (71). If form is the desirous by-product of aesthetic <i>judgement</i>,               then the desired object of <i>judgement</i>, law, is arguably a               relative of form. Philosophically contextualized, law/form can be               grasped, not as delimitation but as aspiration. Impartial until               uniquely activated, law/form sculpts reality without itself containing               (nor inducing) any essential mold, enacting a logic that is, in               and of itself, only analogical.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To               close&#151;and to approach more nearly the issue of critical style               and gender&#151;I return to and rephrase the question I posed earlier:               how can we women writers resist particular stylistic conventions               without too hastily<b> </b>rebuffing the very notion of conventionality?               Reframing the stylistic conventions-- the <i>laws</i>--of critical               discourse as special kinds of <i>forms</i> enables us to perceive               not simply their sovereignty<b> </b>but as well, their relationality,               and thus, to honor them as the earth beneath our feet that is&#150;ineluctably&#150;tilled               when we make tracks upon it.</font></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p align="CENTER">            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works               Cited</b></font></p>            <p align="CENTER">             <p align="CENTER"> </p>            <p>             <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Irigaray,               Luce. <i>This Sex Which is not One. </i>Trans.

Stein&#146;s question to the reporter               has stayed with me. It comes back to me, again and again, as I write               literary criticism, as I prepare to teach, as I read or reread.               Over the years, I&#146;ve become increasingly concerned with critical               voices, both my own and those of others, on the connections (or               lack thereof) between the ways in which an author writes and the               ways in which a critic reads and speaks about that work. Traditional               critical practices, I&#146;ve come to believe, are predicated upon               a sense of the critic as a sort of housekeeper: polishing up gleaming               surfaces to present to the world, offering neat and tidy explications,               and sweeping any leftover textual &quot;debris&quot; under the rug.               Such an approach is fairly widespread among literary critics, but               the practice seems particularly evident and particularly odious               when it is applied to the work of authors, like Gertrude Stein and               Lyn Hejinian (and many others), who are working toward the deconstruction               of fixity, certainty, authority&#150;precisely the attributes valued               in the traditional critical voice. Again and again in my own research,               I&#146;ve found the work of innovative writers like Stein and Hejinian               being twisted, selectively discussed, even ignored so that it can               be fitted into familiar categories, categories where women&#146;s               writing and experiment are &quot;allowed.&quot; Certainly these               strategies are used to contain the radical potential of many voices,               particularly when the voice comes from a disempowered location and               threatens to unsettle power structures (think, for instance, of               past years&#146; representations of Emily Dickinson as a &quot;madwoman               in the attic&quot;). But there is only a relatively small body of               work available on experimental women writers. And, as Marianne DeKoven               has noted, while the association of a woman writer with experimentalism               provides her with a small place in a tiny literary constellation,               it also consigns her to a place where it is even easier to miss               (or dismiss) her.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because               of the ways in which I read the consequences of these more traditional               critical approaches, I know that I cannot participate in them. But               figuring out how to sidestep the &quot;bad&quot; elements of such               a practice without writing &quot;bad&quot; criticism (sloppy, confusing,               pointless, or, worst of all for the academic, unpublishable) has               been a difficult and ongoing process. For me, one of the first steps               toward writing in a critical voice that seems appropriate to discussions               of experimental writing was to relinquish my sense of critical certainty,               to admit to and work with the partiality and limitations of any               particular way of reading, and to approach the authors and their               texts from this &quot;new&quot; position. This process is easier,               I think, when the authors themselves are openly uncertain, welcoming               the reader who might approach from a different direction, who might               be willing to open up a genuine dialogue, rather than to close down               possibilities. In <i>Tender Buttons</i>, Gertrude Stein writes,               &quot;A white hunter is nearly crazy&quot; (475). Her statement               might be read as resonating with Ahab&#146;s quest for Moby Dick,               a quest to find a particular quarry in wide open seas, a quest that               makes him mad and dooms his voyage. If I approach Stein&#146;s (or               Hejinian&#146;s, or&#133;) work as Ahab hunted the white whale,               I will become &quot;nearly crazy,&quot; and my critical voyage will               be doomed as well. The experimental text actively resists that desire               for dominance, for colonization by the critic, sometimes forcefully,               sometimes playfully. Meanings slip and travel, always moving; concentrating               on a single &quot;fish&quot; in a wide open &quot;sea&quot; is to               miss the complexity and variety of the text.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The               writers themselves often offer direct invitations and challenges               to respond to their writing in ways that are speculative, open ended,               and unique. Requiring innovative reading, a tolerance for ambiguity,               a willingness to frolic, the works can frustrate as well as give               pleasure to readers. And these approaches and experiences&#150;uncertainty,               ludic play, self-reflection&#150;need to have a place in my criticism.               When I look to the works of these authors, I see them offering some               suggestions for moving toward an alternative critical practice through               their own admissions of tentativeness, enjoyment, and introspection.               In <i>The Making of Americans</i>, Stein writes:</font></p>            <dir>               <dir>                 <dir>                   <blockquote>                    <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bear                       it in your mind my reader . . . what I have said always                       before to you, that this I write down a little each day                       here on my scraps of paper for you is not just an ordinary                       kind of novel . . . and so my reader arm yourself in every                       kind of way to be patient and eager . . . .

She warns her reader that she               is not writing &quot;an ordinary kind of novel&quot; but one that               will require patience and eagerness, a kind of commitment that seems               qualitatively different from the dispassionate stance favored in               most literary criticism. Rather than the formal detachment required               of the hunter-critic, Stein imagines a reader who will be very much               involved in the work, bringing her own hopes, desires, and personal               investments to the act of reading. And Stein approaches that reader               with her own combination of hope, desire, and investment, asking               her to &quot;love please&quot; the work she has done.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In               Lyn Hejinian&#146;s <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i>, one of her               earliest works, she muses on the power of authorial and readerly               expectations, tracing some of the same pathways as Stein. &quot;that               sweet little block / the taste of a larger pattern&quot; emerges               from time to time, appearing only to disappear back into &quot;tired               mixed trace of chat back&quot; (n.p.). &quot;the readymade is deceptively               passing /its consent to time,&quot; she writes, &quot;mass perhaps               in a form against it / a cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot;               Here Hejinian asks her reader to reflect on her practices of reading,               her desires for the &quot;taste of a larger pattern.&quot; And while               she seems respectful of that desire (in fact she admits to having               it herself), she is also wary of it. Our &quot;readymade&quot; expectations               are &quot;deceptive.&quot; If we enter a text carelessly, without               an awareness of our potential prejudices or proclivities, we&#146;re               likely to seize on those elements we seek, those that are already               familiar to us, those that fit neatly into our own critical patterns,               resulting in a &quot;cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot; She               offers a similar reminder to her reader in <i>My Life</i>, writing,               &quot;But as I&#146;ve said before, I am nearsighted, and there               are many figures in this scene which might form different scenes&quot;               (97). As herself both reader and writer of her life, Hejinian occupies               a unique position that both coincides with and differs from that               of other readers. In a break from the kind of distance one might               expect from the autobiographer looking back on her life to present               it as exemplary or edifying in some way, Hejinian questions her               own authority as reader, her own &quot;nearsightedness.&quot;</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What               I want to say here is that the texts themselves can teach us how               to read them. In the passages above, the authors speak directly               to readers, encouraging them to break the rules of critical discourse.               Stein asks for eagerness, tenderness, love. Hejinian cautions her               readers to approach the very act of reading suspiciously, flexibly,               imaginatively. It&#146;s not so much a matter of being able to &quot;get               inside&quot; a particular author&#146;s mind, to suss out her intentions.               And it&#146;s also not a matter of writing &quot;sloppy&quot; criticism               that piles up possibilities without purpose. Instead, at least for               me as a reader and critic and teacher, it&#146;s a matter of letting               my prose wander and wonder. I have never been sure how to interpret               a marginal comment on one of my grad school papers that said I wrote               &quot;like a prosecutor.&quot; While I think that professor found               that particular essay&#146;s language infelicitous, I also suspect               she admired the single-mindedness with which I argued my interpretation               of the work at hand. But I am sure that a &quot;prosecutor&#146;s               voice&quot; isn&#146;t the one I want to hear from myself as a critic.               Rather, I want to hear a bit of the playfulness of Stein, the speculation               of Hejinian, and my own sense of my critical practices as being,               well, <i>practices</i>, in process.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What               remains at the center of my own work as a critic is to consider               the ways in which acts of &quot;doing&quot; help to create the &quot;doers.&quot;               There is an important relationship that I imagine between myself               and the authors I read, write about, and teach. Just as my critical               work could not exist without their work, they point to ways in which               their works are brought into being by readings. Their writing helps               me to interrogate the ways that I construct my own identities as               teacher, writer, reader, and I return that attention to their works               as well&#150;what are they teaching me, writing about, reading into               their texts? As I use my critical training to look for the gaps               in the texts, I must always be aware of my own. As I think of the               ways they unsettle constructions of identity, writing, language,               I must always look for ways to unsettle my own ways of seeing, reading,               and writing such that I don&#146;t &quot;refix&quot; what is meant               to be open ended. The ways in which my own identity is predicated               on teaching, writing, and reading have probably occluded my abilities               to see the complexities of these dynamics, but I will continue to               work toward clarifying my own ways of seeing, my own approaches               toward &quot;reading the way she writes.&quot;</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Works               Cited</b></font></p>            <dir>               <dir>                 <p>                <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Berry,                   Ellen E. <i>Curved Thought and Textual Wandering: Gertrude Stein&#146;s                   Postmodernism</i>.

It happens               "naturally" because we all see the boundaries differently. The boundaries               between gender, genre, class, culture, etc. are of necessity skewed               by the differences in how we see them. What happens unfortunately               in academia is that those who see these boundaries too differently               get knocked out of the game before they even get to graduate school.               It's amazing, if you just think about it, how much power freshmen               comp teachers have--not in terms of their status or earning power               which is ridiculously low, but in terms of how they can calcify               an idea or loosen its grip on a young writer's mind. Techniques               that readers learn (usually in school, sometimes on their own) to               "grasp" a text become one of the determinants of its worthwhileness.               One of these techniques is assignment of genre to a text. "Is this               a poem? What is a poem?" As boundaries blur, I think, everything               becomes more like a poem--open to more subjective reading, less               linear, more "dreamlike"--but this too crumbles because then I would               have to say that some cultural critiques on the CTHEORY site are               poems while certain poems are quite linear indeed and I'd have to               call them "verse fiction." Or something like that. A waste of time               to do this, I think.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As               you pointed out in your prompt for this <i>HOW2</i> forum, writers               are constrained in many ways by the "forum" of academia. What that               means is if they write the way they'd like to, nobody pays any attention.               There are few things sadder than paranoid academics who have something               to say and spend all of their energy scoping out the potential hazards               of speaking the way they want to. The truth is that we all get ignored               much of the time, and those who aren't ignored occasionally are               usually very frantic crazy people. I sometimes imagine what my life               would be like if everyone treated me like I was the Rosetta Stone               (not fun, no Peace). I don't mean to belittle the paranoid academics--I've               been one-- because usually someone has terrified them into being               that way, and there is a tremendous amount of fear and loathing               that gets bantered around in the name of higher education.

Hence, as experimentation and critical style is a topic               of discussion, Mytili Jagannathan and Elisabeth Joyce asked me to               write into this amazing space (<i>HOW2</i> as a place to stand)               and talk about this--this desire, this fact of my having done critical               writing in an experimental style. What I am about to say is--it&#146;s               not just a style. It&#146;s a method. Who gave me permission? How               did I &quot;do&quot; it? As many questions as there are--here are               what I think are some answers: Desire, need, and the political-cultural               moment. Even reckless, but determined, I was willing to play and               fail--I was already an artist. Although it took me years more to               recognize this absolutely. What&#146;s going on? I could give you               a contradictory narrative. This would be very typical--compliant               and resistant me inventing (or addressing) something. I knew this               writing was risky--indeed &quot;The Pink Guitar&quot; essay discusses               some of the negative reactions of some fairly annoyed, and momentarily               powerful, people. (Some of whom were &quot;in charge of&quot; my               tenure for my academic job--and against it, too.) Not a joke--of               course there are potential negative impacts--some people are going               to hate what you do, and possibly think you are self-indulgent or               narcissistic (etc.) for choosing essay modes. Thus the risk of this               kind of expression--the joy of it--must overcome and swamp prudence               or narrow conceptions of what writing is, what a career is. Sometimes               you have to wait to feel safe. Safer. It is a very subtle and situational               decision. There is no simple &quot;answer&quot; that the past can               give the present on this issue. But if you can stand (or can survive)               that joyous impudence and imprudence, then proceed. But don&#146;t               forget that I was, during this same period, writing critical prose--in               <i>Writing Beyond the Ending</i> and <i>H.D.: The Career of that               Struggle</i>--prose and analyses that I also absolutely wanted to               write. No one was making me do it, as if one kind of writing is               better or truer or more authentic than another. </font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of               course, one is subject to professional pressures.

It came about this way.               Having given a seminar at a Barnard Conference on Women and Society               on the question (not the certainty) of &quot;a&quot; female aesthetic--a               burning issue in 1979--I was asked to write it up. So I did. I now               see the commitment to multiple citation and to recording many of               the voices of that seminar as a mini-<i>Arcades</i>. A feminist               Benjaminian <i>Arcades</i>. Although I was committed to collaging               other people&#146;s voices with my own as only one among many, in               actuality it did not quite work out that way. Authorship is not               dissolved by fiat. But that is why the &quot;author&quot; of that               essay is myself and &quot;Workshop 9&quot;--the presence of interlocutors               was crucial.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I               was aware of using modernist &quot;devices&quot; for feminist purposes.               The fluid form of talking, the enormously excited and participatory               group of women for whom I was the seminar leader--writing into that               fervent and palpable and aroused and debating female space was crucial.               I was writing into a cultural and political need for analysis and               the collection of evidence. Thinking was a real situation. It was               a moment (this writing comes from a political and cultural moment).               There was nothing willed about it. There was a politics of culture,               and I was trying to name some part of it. But without distortion.               For I also did not try to falsify or distort what I thought: that               &quot;feminine&quot; writing tactics were the tactics that can be               chosen by any non-dominant group. The rhetorics are situational,               not essentialist strategies. This was not the popular finding then,               when we were, in general, in the full bloom of a dynamic and rather               absolute sense of female difference. Yet insofar as I was acting               oppositionally--refusing patriarchal culture as a choice, I also               chose to use the very rhetorics I discuss.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Letter               writing to friends.

These were some sources.               Teaching, as a social free association along the lines of investigation.               I think what I did, in these essays, was to invent an intersubjective               space, one between reader and text, between writer and reader, between               author and evidence, between analysis and need. A looping of response.               Not one of hierarchy or claims of controlling authority over a set               of materials. And the central strategy of modernism--collage--was               another source. I entered the practice of the field (a central strategy               of the postmodern)--the creation of an extent or an area, a site               in which things happen. Ludic things: Rhythms of apprehension. Stress               shifting. Changeups. Carnivalizing analytic discourses. Mongrel,               hybrid sounds. Placing the reader, as well as the writer, in a variety               of subject places. Faceting. Dissolving the author into the sounds               of the text. Making chaos, diversity, m&eacute;lange. Constructing               loose ends! Making there be a porous openness of thought, not a               sealing over of thought. There is a loft in this method--and it               is not just a style--it <u>is</u> a method. It is not willful writing               as in &quot;I will myself to do this because it would be a good               thing.&quot; It is writing poised as art is on the cusp of willful               willessness.

I can&#146;t               begin to think of &quot;models of critical writing&quot; without               almost viscerally feeling the compressed time of my days, the need               to make use of time efficiently, the need not to waste words or               move in tangential directions because (like so many) I&#146;ve got               a kid to pick up (and any number of other realities might be inserted               here at the end of this sentence). </font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Probably               this has to do with my schedule these days, with wanting to garden               but spending much of the day in my office trying to finish a manuscript               that never wants to end, while knowing my &quot;work day&quot; <i>will</i>               end when kindergarten ends, and that I need to make the oatmeal               cookies I promised for my daughter to take to her class for snack               tomorrow, and then I need to rush back to school for an evening               graduate seminar in &quot;Feminist Poetics,&quot; which seems a               remarkably wonderful and appropriate course to rush to after such               a day. But exhausting in rapid shifts and forms of attention. None               of this schedule is unique to me; and no event in the day is distinct,               finally, from any other. They echo into each other, and I think               of Virginia Woolf as I mash butter into sugar and explain measuring               to Chloe. (And of course think of Woolf&#146;s concern with how               &quot;Chloe&quot; is measured and learns to measure). And then I               think, how so very banal and typical and clich&eacute;d that I locate               my academic experience in relation to the domestic and the maternal,               and maybe even how self-centered, given this stage in my life.

And what is interesting to me is not that everyone               should know about my daily life but that I censor its possibilities               for taking me somewhere in terms of my critical writing. I wonder               how I might more fully allow the echoes that go on throughout my               day, that carry soundings from one arena to another, to more fruitfully               be admitted into the <i>process</i> of critical writing, whether               or not the process shows up in the final product. Thinking back,               it&#146;s the essays that allow the process to show up (I just taught               DuPlessis&#146; &quot;For the Etruscans&quot; last night) that first               prompted me to consider how the essay form functions to contain               and censor; what I&#146;m interested in thinking about now is how               those efforts to contain and censor are internalized in my thought               processes. When I spoke earlier about &quot;different forms of attention,&quot;               I meant that the boundaries between ways of thinking so often descend               from the form of writing/creating we are doing, so that I <i>begin</i>               thinking in certain ways that differ depending on whether I am moving               toward an essay or a drawing or an oatmeal cookie or a chat with               my daughter. I&#146;d like to disturb that originary moment (which               isn&#146;t originary at all), in which the shapes of my thinking               are too often determined by the shape/genre/form of the product.</font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While               I love the &quot;innovative&quot; essay, I also realize I can&#146;t               focus on writing that essay as an <i>end</i> in itself. This has               partly to do with my own sense of insecurity and partly (largely)               to do with practical knowledge of the hierarchies of the academic               institutions in which I work. I&#146;ve read too many files as a               member of a search committee or a tenure committee. And we all know               that the ability to stand up at MLA, for instance, and read off               of a randomly arranged series of notecards is &quot;allowable&quot;               for only a few. I&#146;d like to think this won&#146;t always be               the case but in the meantime, I&#146;m trying to tackle the issue               from the other end &#151; where the essay gets started in our heads,               what shapes the directions we feel free to take or prohibited from               considering, what happens when a different focus of attention is               brought to the matter. </font></p>            <p>            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although               I like to think that a more permeable focus would help me not to               feel pulled in a million directions (and unfocused about most of               them), I also realize that many tasks in critical writing do involve               isolated, systematic, and synthetic processes that demand a comprehensive               grasp of an issue (and thus, lots of research, reading, thinking)               and an ability to situate a discussion in relation to other discussions.               I actually enjoy these processes, but at the same time they are               probably the most problematic for me when I think of issues of time               and writing, because they suck up time, lots of time. So, in deciding               how to choose my time, I most often find it imperative for professional               reasons to read that extra article, etc. rather than sit and write               in the kind of relaxed (which doesn&#146;t mean unfocused or unthoughtful)               manner I&#146;m enjoying right now. This choice is intensified by               the overwhelming amount of information available now, and the difficulty               of letting go of the notion that I have to keep up with everything.               Technology terrifies me in this way, because it presents itself               in my life as a way of demanding more from my time, asking that               I keep track of and make use of more information. My own terror,               I&#146;m sure, closes me off to many of the benefits of technology               and of the web, and perhaps as time eases up I can also relax in               front of the computer. Who knows. And so, it&#146;s now time to               turn off the computer and pick up Chloe. No cookies today, but maybe               a little PBS and some time in the yard before class tonight, thinking               about Erica Hunt and matters of the sandbox.</font></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p> <b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">BIO:</font>               </b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Linda               A.

She is completing a book-length study               of feminist reading practices and contemporary poetry and is actively               pursuing a second book project on modernist women poets and economics.               </font>             <p>&nbsp;</p>            <hr>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><img src="../../photos/hofer.jpg" width="169" height="203" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Jen Hofer"><a name="hofer"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The               Politics of Critical Style: Two Manifestos</font></b></font></p>            <p><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>By               Jen Hofer</b></font></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>             <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Formal               Negotiations</b></font></p>            <p align="JUSTIFY">             <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>            <p align="JUSTIFY">            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Objects               are.
