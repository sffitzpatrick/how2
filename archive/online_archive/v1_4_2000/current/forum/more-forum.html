            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
              is embarrassing to have a style in public, because it means you 
              are vulnerable, vulnerable to being &quot;read.&quot; People do 
              all kinds of things to avoid this, including pretending to be stylish 
              in some new but store-bought way (following a &quot;model&quot;), 
              which is a more fashionable version of the older habit of writing 
              in an impersonal voice of Latinate neutrality and (thus) authority. 
              Having a style means you are situated, if only in your sign-making 
              self, and not divinely scientific. This is especially scary for 
              people who don&#146;t yet have some kind of institutional authority 
              such as tenure or fame.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              world is largely bleak and life is short. Why be bleak ourselves? 
              Why not create pleasures? If I think of the audience when I write, 
              it is an audience of people who just wanna have fun. Though I do 
              very much include learning about things besides me and my style 
              in the notion of fun! (I once had a difficult midwifery with a graduate 
              student, a poet, who was a marvelous stylist. Every sentence of 
              her dissertation was beautiful, surprising, voiced. Every sentence 
              said &quot;pay no attention to that Modernist woman poet on my title 
              page! Watch me Write!&quot; )</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Discovering 
              your style is tantamount to discovering your mind, even your intellectual 
              mission. It is hard, takes years, etc., like learning to play a 
              musical instrument. Much that is in it isn&#146;t ours in particular, 
              but our various situations. No need to fake that, it will out itself 
              if we take writing seriously, if we consider critical writing to 
              <i>be</i> writing and not just self-advertisement or a strategy 
              for advancement.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
              to the practical side of this matter. My particular critical writing 
              has, from grad school on, attracted admiration but signaled some 
              askew relation to The Profession (the relation of a poet to it, 
              as it happens). I did get a job at a university, and am now a full 
              professor, and have published some books, so it didn't get seriously 
              in my way as I wended it up the Ladder. On the other hand, I long 
              ago gave up sending articles to journals unless I&#146;m invited 
              to. It may well be that times have changed or are at least changing, 
              but there was a period in which one&#146;s writing had to be instantly 
              recognizable as signifying membership in a particular critical or 
              theoretical school to be recognized as a contribution to scholarship, 
              and there were stylistic methods of indicating that (especially 
              the long footnote naming every important person in that posse who 
              has ever written on the matter under discussion in your own sentence 
              or paragraph. See Bourdieu.) I didn&#146;t understand the outline 
              of my mission in the written world yet, and wasn&#146;t about to 
              signal affiliations that weren&#146;t real. I think, I hope, the 
              new world of online journals will reduce the homogeneity of expectations.</font></p>

              Mary Baine Campbell is a professor at Brandeis University, in the 
              Department of English and American Literature, where she teaches 
              medieval and Renaissance literatures, poetry, and women's studies. 
              Her books include <i>The Witness and the Other World: Exotic European 
              Travel Writing, 400-1600</i> (1988), <i>The World, the Flesh, and 
              Angels</i> (poetry, 1989), "'Are Sin, Disease and Death Real?'"

              Early Modern Europe</i> (1999), as well as a new collection of poetry, 
              <i>Trouble</i>, which has not yet found a publisher. During the 
              summer of 2000, Campbell made a libretto for a new opera by Martin

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
              her essay "Cos&igrave; Fan Tutti" analyst, linguist, and feminist 
              Luce Irigaray takes up (and takes on) the western, psychoanalytic 
              tradition by which woman is said to speak, to mean, only with palpable 
              difficulty. If, as psychoanalysis instructs us, gender difference 
              is born "in" language, and if, as common sense allows us, the law 
              of language has been "for centuries" "prescribed" (87) by men, then 
              the truly signifying female subject would seem an improbability. 
              Notes Irigaray (in the words of Jacques Lacan): "There is no woman 
              who is not excluded by the nature of things, which is the nature 
              of words..." (ibid.) </font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
              requires no great leap to turn from the laws of language to the 
              language of law, from the <i>logos </i>that is the symbol of meaning 
              to the <i>logic</i> that is its repository. Man's word bespeaks 
              &#150;and begets&#150;the law that keeps woman outside the scheme 
              of things. Subjected to the circular ratiocination through which 
              meaning is standardized by a compulsory logic that has already determined 
              it as such, woman presumably rests beneath and beyond "the real," 
              inscribed within it only as the lack that guarantees its adequacy.&#9; 
              </font></p>
            <p> 
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
              Irigaray, the answer to the conundrum of the woman who seeks to 
              mean lies in creatively seizing and appropriating her place of lawlessness. 
              Woman's lack, marked by her tenuous relationship to the process 
              of signification, is reimagined as excess; absence becomes omnipresence, 
              quiescence--chaos: "Is it already getting around&#151; [...] that 
              women diffuse themselves according to modalities scarcely compatible 
              with the framework of the ruling symbolics [?] Which doesn't happen 
              without causing some turbulence, we might even say some whirlwinds,..." 
              (106)</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
              I reflect upon my own experiences as a woman who speaks to mean 
              and means to write, I recall having effected a few whirlwinds of 
              my own. When a teenager, I was cautioned to modify my prose style,<b> 
              </b>whose program could best be characterized by a profusion of 
              adjectives (often grouped in threes), an obsession with the semicolon, 
              and an insistence upon never using a short word when a longer one 
              would do. Today, as I aspire to signify within the parameters of 
              the academy, my stabs at meaning are still deemed provocations by 
              those I ask to interpret them. My textual analyses, for example, 
              are sometimes called "dense" and insufficiently "logical." The legitimacy 
              and specificity of such critiques notwithstanding, I do wonder if 
              my style, as well as the stuff of which it is made, might be attributed 
              to something other than carelessness or idiosyncrasy. Am I, by dint 
              of my sex, a renegade apt to disrupt the<b> </b>stylistic and scholastic 
              conventions (the <i>laws</i>) of critical discourse? Do I, as woman, 
              resist the mandate to be understood? </font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Recently, 
              at the close of a class I taught on the possibility of forging modern 
              identity through artistic practice, I received a most uncharitable 
              evaluation from a student, who complained of "learning nothing" 
              and suffering as I "prattled on and on." Although I cannot verify 
              its author, I suspect it is the same young man who was, throughout 
              the tenure of my class, sullen, indifferent, and enamored of Goethe's 
              hero, Faust. If resistance precedes dominance, then perhaps to prattle--"to 
              talk (or write) much or idly," producing "the babble of a child"--is 
              divine.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now, 
              as I begin a dissertation about the relationship between beauty 
              and ethics in the poetics of the Harlem Renaissance, I am compelled 
              to acknowledge the difficulty, not simply of woman speaking, but 
              of woman speaking <i>beauty</i>. In her apologia for beauty, <i>On 
              Beauty and Being Just</i>, Elaine Scarry<b> </b>laments its banishment 
              from critical discourse. No longer <i>in style</i> within the halls 
              of contemporary academe, beauty is still spoken but only illicitly--"in 
              whispers." (57) A primary argument against beauty holds special 
              significance for the woman who would expound upon it: political 
              in nature, it asserts the burden of beauty for the woman wholly 
              reduced to it and sometimes, endangered when urged to fulfill the 
              desires it incites. (79) The gorgeous movie star is driven by unending 
              and demanding scrutiny to drown her pain in booze and pills. The 
              winsome school girl--robbed of her childhood by premature marriage...or 
              worse. With this in mind, I might be justifiably persuaded to discard 
              the discourse of beauty. Yet a less material, more formal narrative 
              of beauty allows me to complicate the notion that its mere articulation 
              hurts women.</font></p>
            <p> 
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
              the eighteenth century, philosophers such as Immanuel Kant subdivided 
              "beauty" into two categories: the beautiful and the sublime. While 
              the sublime, thought "eternal," "principled," and "righteous," was 
              characterized as male, the beautiful, thought "small," "gay," and 
              "charming," was characterized as female and became, as Scarry relates, 
              "dismissible." (83-5) A counter to the political argument against 
              beauty here emerges; in contrast to a conventional feminist claim 
              that beauty is too grave for woman to bear, a conventional philosophical 
              line on beauty, epitomized<i> </i><u>in </u>woman, attributes to 
              it, an embarrassment of levity. If one adapts the Irigarayan innovation 
              of turning less into more, one can strain the qualities of beauty: 
              insignificance, gaiety, and charm to the celebration of "womanist" 
              superfluity and sorcery. Philosophically (and historically) speaking, 
              then, succumbing to an academic convention&#151;whether feminist 
              or misogynist&#151;by which beauty is to be abandoned, may be abandoning 
              both woman and the peculiar expressivity she makes possible. </font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ultimately, 
              we women come to the pleasure of withstanding and reshaping given 
              <i>formats</i> of meaning (no matter from whom they derive). But 
              can we not come to the pleasure of <i>form</i>? For in decrying 
              the phallogocentrism of mainstream signification, Irigaray likewise 
              decries "form," which she counts among an entire set of "values 
              promulgated by patriarchal society and culture, values inscribed 
              in the philosophical corpus..." (86) Irigaray's misrepresentation 
              of "form" derives from her narrow interpretation of the "law" to 
              which it bears resemblance&#150;a move strengthened by her conflation 
              of patriarchy with philosophy. Because she focuses solely on philosophy's 
              seemingly masculinist<b> </b>predilection for transcendent objectivity, 
              she ignores what it gives rise to in the way of improvisation and 
              particularism. By turning again to the controversial discourse of 
              beauty, I can revise Irigaray's narrative of form, which likens 
              it to a normalizing "judgement" dictating the course of "nature" 
              (107) and, in the process, challenge both her traditional characterization 
              and her implicit gendering of law.</font></p>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In

              understanding and reason," posits no special law with regard to 
              the nature of things but only, a "principle peculiar to itself upon 
              which law [is] <i>sought.</i>" (15) The offspring of judgement, 
              aesthetic judgement, whose specific job it is to divine beauty, 
              has an even more nuanced relationship to the real, for it does not 
              even seek "knowledge" of a thing but simply yields to the <i>form</i><u> 
              </u>that marks its crystallization "<i>within</i><u> </u>a subject" 
              (71). If form is the desirous by-product of aesthetic <i>judgement</i>, 
              then the desired object of <i>judgement</i>, law, is arguably a 
              relative of form. Philosophically contextualized, law/form can be 
              grasped, not as delimitation but as aspiration. Impartial until 
              uniquely activated, law/form sculpts reality without itself containing 
              (nor inducing) any essential mold, enacting a logic that is, in 
              and of itself, only analogical.</font></p>

              close&#151;and to approach more nearly the issue of critical style 
              and gender&#151;I return to and rephrase the question I posed earlier: 
              how can we women writers resist particular stylistic conventions 
              without too hastily<b> </b>rebuffing the very notion of conventionality? 
              Reframing the stylistic conventions-- the <i>laws</i>--of critical 
              discourse as special kinds of <i>forms</i> enables us to perceive 
              not simply their sovereignty<b> </b>but as well, their relationality, 
              and thus, to honor them as the earth beneath our feet that is&#150;ineluctably&#150;tilled

              getting it accepted to REFEREED journals, the oldest and most respected 
              ones especially. So many people who don't know much about one's 
              area of expertise must judge your intellectual worth, and they don't 
              often do it by actually reading what you've written. You have to

                negotiating it right now. I sent off a job application today; 
                I am (at least on bad days) a desperate adjunct (and fearful of 
                having to leave the place where I grew up in order to get a "good 
                job") as are many folks I know. Some of my students work entry 
                level in Silicon Valley and make more money than I do. Some of 
                my students got through high school without reading a novel. Some 
                of my students are promising poets. One said recently, "I LOVE 
                TO WRITE!"</font></li>
              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
                are lots of different models. And I suppose the innovators (or 
                for that matter people working in traditions or cultures made 
                marginal&#150;to put it politely) have usually if not always had 
                to wait (to be heard/valued, etc). Unless they lucked into some 
                sudden fashionability somehow.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Do 
                I feel pressure to conform to certain styles in order to survive 
                in this profession? Yes, but then I wonder, what is my profession? 
                Poet? Genre-slammer? Freak? I mean I teach and I think I do it 
                rather well&#150;and I write critical work published in "innovative" 
                forums&#150;the penning of which holds me&#150;can consume me&#150;writing 
                toward whatever it is I'm focused on, and toward audience&#150;perhaps 
                the audience I imagine and want is not the same as that of academics. 
                Do academics just write toward search committees? How does anyone 
                have any fun? Or style, for that matter. </font></li>
              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
                is important actually. I left the English Department at Reed College 
                for the Native American Studies Department at UC Berkeley. This 
                had partly to do with style. How writers structure the world; 
                how the culture feels falling on one's intellect and embodiment. 
                If it works (i.e., makes sense to one). (Not to mention, who "makes" 
                the culture.) (I want to add quotation marks around who, the, 
                and culture.) (One of my passions as an English teacher is getting 
                people to quit using quotation marks when they're unnecessary 
                though I tend to expect to see them on stop signs soon.)</font></li>
              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
                do feel pressure and the pressure does something to the work I 
                write, as does the pressure of my own momentum and interest. I 
                was going to say I ignore the pressure, but that would be a touch 
                utopian of me.</font></li>

              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is 
                inclusion of the personal a taboo, an innovation, or has it been 
                worn out by overuse? All of the above.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How 
                has the proliferation of online publications changed assumptions 
                about public intellectual exchange, and transformed the parameters 
                for critical dialogue? It's made things a little easier, a touch 
                less hierarchical, a bit more anarchic. (And I want to say that 
                I see pretty much everything as public intellectual discourse&#150;even 
                some ad with chicks in bikinis&#150;this has an effect on the 
                intellect. I know this is not an original thought.)</font></li>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">During 
              her 1935 lecture tour in the United States, a reporter asked Gertrude 
              Stein, &quot;Miss Stein, why don&#146;t you write the way you speak?&quot; 
              Stein replied, &quot;Young man, why don&#146;t you read the way 
              I write?&quot; (Berry 1). Stein&#146;s question to the reporter 
              has stayed with me. It comes back to me, again and again, as I write 
              literary criticism, as I prepare to teach, as I read or reread. 
              Over the years, I&#146;ve become increasingly concerned with critical 
              voices, both my own and those of others, on the connections (or 
              lack thereof) between the ways in which an author writes and the 
              ways in which a critic reads and speaks about that work. Traditional 
              critical practices, I&#146;ve come to believe, are predicated upon 
              a sense of the critic as a sort of housekeeper: polishing up gleaming 
              surfaces to present to the world, offering neat and tidy explications, 
              and sweeping any leftover textual &quot;debris&quot; under the rug. 
              Such an approach is fairly widespread among literary critics, but 
              the practice seems particularly evident and particularly odious 
              when it is applied to the work of authors, like Gertrude Stein and 
              Lyn Hejinian (and many others), who are working toward the deconstruction 
              of fixity, certainty, authority&#150;precisely the attributes valued 
              in the traditional critical voice. Again and again in my own research, 
              I&#146;ve found the work of innovative writers like Stein and Hejinian 
              being twisted, selectively discussed, even ignored so that it can 
              be fitted into familiar categories, categories where women&#146;s 
              writing and experiment are &quot;allowed.&quot; Certainly these 
              strategies are used to contain the radical potential of many voices, 
              particularly when the voice comes from a disempowered location and 
              threatens to unsettle power structures (think, for instance, of 
              past years&#146; representations of Emily Dickinson as a &quot;madwoman 
              in the attic&quot;). But there is only a relatively small body of 
              work available on experimental women writers. And, as Marianne DeKoven 
              has noted, while the association of a woman writer with experimentalism 
              provides her with a small place in a tiny literary constellation, 
              it also consigns her to a place where it is even easier to miss 
              (or dismiss) her.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
              of the ways in which I read the consequences of these more traditional 
              critical approaches, I know that I cannot participate in them. But 
              figuring out how to sidestep the &quot;bad&quot; elements of such 
              a practice without writing &quot;bad&quot; criticism (sloppy, confusing, 
              pointless, or, worst of all for the academic, unpublishable) has 
              been a difficult and ongoing process. For me, one of the first steps 
              toward writing in a critical voice that seems appropriate to discussions 
              of experimental writing was to relinquish my sense of critical certainty, 
              to admit to and work with the partiality and limitations of any 
              particular way of reading, and to approach the authors and their 
              texts from this &quot;new&quot; position. This process is easier, 
              I think, when the authors themselves are openly uncertain, welcoming 
              the reader who might approach from a different direction, who might 
              be willing to open up a genuine dialogue, rather than to close down 
              possibilities. In <i>Tender Buttons</i>, Gertrude Stein writes, 
              &quot;A white hunter is nearly crazy&quot; (475). Her statement 
              might be read as resonating with Ahab&#146;s quest for Moby Dick, 
              a quest to find a particular quarry in wide open seas, a quest that 
              makes him mad and dooms his voyage. If I approach Stein&#146;s (or 
              Hejinian&#146;s, or&#133;) work as Ahab hunted the white whale, 
              I will become &quot;nearly crazy,&quot; and my critical voyage will 
              be doomed as well. The experimental text actively resists that desire 
              for dominance, for colonization by the critic, sometimes forcefully, 
              sometimes playfully. Meanings slip and travel, always moving; concentrating 
              on a single &quot;fish&quot; in a wide open &quot;sea&quot; is to 
              miss the complexity and variety of the text.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              writers themselves often offer direct invitations and challenges 
              to respond to their writing in ways that are speculative, open ended, 
              and unique. Requiring innovative reading, a tolerance for ambiguity, 
              a willingness to frolic, the works can frustrate as well as give 
              pleasure to readers. And these approaches and experiences&#150;uncertainty, 
              ludic play, self-reflection&#150;need to have a place in my criticism. 
              When I look to the works of these authors, I see them offering some 
              suggestions for moving toward an alternative critical practice through 
              their own admissions of tentativeness, enjoyment, and introspection.

              her direct address to her reader, Stein creates an intimacy wherein 
              she can confess her desires, as though she is asking a dear friend 
              or lover (rather than, say, a monomaniacal hunter) for a special 
              kindness, a special way of reading. She warns her reader that she 
              is not writing &quot;an ordinary kind of novel&quot; but one that 
              will require patience and eagerness, a kind of commitment that seems 
              qualitatively different from the dispassionate stance favored in 
              most literary criticism. Rather than the formal detachment required 
              of the hunter-critic, Stein imagines a reader who will be very much 
              involved in the work, bringing her own hopes, desires, and personal 
              investments to the act of reading. And Stein approaches that reader 
              with her own combination of hope, desire, and investment, asking 
              her to &quot;love please&quot; the work she has done.</font></p>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
              Lyn Hejinian&#146;s <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i>, one of her 
              earliest works, she muses on the power of authorial and readerly 
              expectations, tracing some of the same pathways as Stein. &quot;that 
              sweet little block / the taste of a larger pattern&quot; emerges 
              from time to time, appearing only to disappear back into &quot;tired 
              mixed trace of chat back&quot; (n.p.). &quot;the readymade is deceptively 
              passing /its consent to time,&quot; she writes, &quot;mass perhaps 
              in a form against it / a cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot; 
              Here Hejinian asks her reader to reflect on her practices of reading, 
              her desires for the &quot;taste of a larger pattern.&quot; And while 
              she seems respectful of that desire (in fact she admits to having 
              it herself), she is also wary of it. Our &quot;readymade&quot; expectations 
              are &quot;deceptive.&quot; If we enter a text carelessly, without 
              an awareness of our potential prejudices or proclivities, we&#146;re 
              likely to seize on those elements we seek, those that are already 
              familiar to us, those that fit neatly into our own critical patterns, 
              resulting in a &quot;cheap reading of what surrounds.&quot; She 
              offers a similar reminder to her reader in <i>My Life</i>, writing, 
              &quot;But as I&#146;ve said before, I am nearsighted, and there 
              are many figures in this scene which might form different scenes&quot; 
              (97). As herself both reader and writer of her life, Hejinian occupies 
              a unique position that both coincides with and differs from that 
              of other readers. In a break from the kind of distance one might 
              expect from the autobiographer looking back on her life to present 
              it as exemplary or edifying in some way, Hejinian questions her 
              own authority as reader, her own &quot;nearsightedness.&quot;</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
              I want to say here is that the texts themselves can teach us how 
              to read them. In the passages above, the authors speak directly 
              to readers, encouraging them to break the rules of critical discourse. 
              Stein asks for eagerness, tenderness, love. Hejinian cautions her 
              readers to approach the very act of reading suspiciously, flexibly, 
              imaginatively. It&#146;s not so much a matter of being able to &quot;get 
              inside&quot; a particular author&#146;s mind, to suss out her intentions. 
              And it&#146;s also not a matter of writing &quot;sloppy&quot; criticism 
              that piles up possibilities without purpose. Instead, at least for 
              me as a reader and critic and teacher, it&#146;s a matter of letting 
              my prose wander and wonder. I have never been sure how to interpret 
              a marginal comment on one of my grad school papers that said I wrote 
              &quot;like a prosecutor.&quot; While I think that professor found 
              that particular essay&#146;s language infelicitous, I also suspect 
              she admired the single-mindedness with which I argued my interpretation 
              of the work at hand. But I am sure that a &quot;prosecutor&#146;s 
              voice&quot; isn&#146;t the one I want to hear from myself as a critic. 
              Rather, I want to hear a bit of the playfulness of Stein, the speculation 
              of Hejinian, and my own sense of my critical practices as being, 
              well, <i>practices</i>, in process.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What 
              remains at the center of my own work as a critic is to consider 
              the ways in which acts of &quot;doing&quot; help to create the &quot;doers.&quot; 
              There is an important relationship that I imagine between myself 
              and the authors I read, write about, and teach. Just as my critical 
              work could not exist without their work, they point to ways in which 
              their works are brought into being by readings. Their writing helps 
              me to interrogate the ways that I construct my own identities as 
              teacher, writer, reader, and I return that attention to their works 
              as well&#150;what are they teaching me, writing about, reading into 
              their texts? As I use my critical training to look for the gaps 
              in the texts, I must always be aware of my own. As I think of the 
              ways they unsettle constructions of identity, writing, language, 
              I must always look for ways to unsettle my own ways of seeing, reading, 
              and writing such that I don&#146;t &quot;refix&quot; what is meant 
              to be open ended. The ways in which my own identity is predicated 
              on teaching, writing, and reading have probably occluded my abilities 
              to see the complexities of these dynamics, but I will continue to 
              work toward clarifying my own ways of seeing, my own approaches 
              toward &quot;reading the way she writes.&quot;</font></p>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              think that blurring the lines between poetry, fiction, and literary 
              or cultural criticism is a good and necessary thing that is happening 
              of its own accord, not just for women but for everyone. It happens 
              "naturally" because we all see the boundaries differently. The boundaries 
              between gender, genre, class, culture, etc. are of necessity skewed 
              by the differences in how we see them. What happens unfortunately 
              in academia is that those who see these boundaries too differently 
              get knocked out of the game before they even get to graduate school. 
              It's amazing, if you just think about it, how much power freshmen 
              comp teachers have--not in terms of their status or earning power 
              which is ridiculously low, but in terms of how they can calcify 
              an idea or loosen its grip on a young writer's mind. Techniques 
              that readers learn (usually in school, sometimes on their own) to 
              "grasp" a text become one of the determinants of its worthwhileness. 
              One of these techniques is assignment of genre to a text. "Is this 
              a poem? What is a poem?" As boundaries blur, I think, everything 
              becomes more like a poem--open to more subjective reading, less 
              linear, more "dreamlike"--but this too crumbles because then I would 
              have to say that some cultural critiques on the CTHEORY site are 
              poems while certain poems are quite linear indeed and I'd have to 
              call them "verse fiction." Or something like that. A waste of time 
              to do this, I think.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
              you pointed out in your prompt for this <i>HOW2</i> forum, writers 
              are constrained in many ways by the "forum" of academia. What that 
              means is if they write the way they'd like to, nobody pays any attention. 
              There are few things sadder than paranoid academics who have something 
              to say and spend all of their energy scoping out the potential hazards 
              of speaking the way they want to. The truth is that we all get ignored 
              much of the time, and those who aren't ignored occasionally are 
              usually very frantic crazy people. I sometimes imagine what my life 
              would be like if everyone treated me like I was the Rosetta Stone 
              (not fun, no Peace). I don't mean to belittle the paranoid academics--I've 
              been one-- because usually someone has terrified them into being 
              that way, and there is a tremendous amount of fear and loathing 
              that gets bantered around in the name of higher education. But as

            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              sometimes hear about <i>The Pink Guitar</i> as a text of desire. 
              A talisman. Hence, as experimentation and critical style is a topic 
              of discussion, Mytili Jagannathan and Elisabeth Joyce asked me to 
              write into this amazing space (<i>HOW2</i> as a place to stand) 
              and talk about this--this desire, this fact of my having done critical 
              writing in an experimental style. What I am about to say is--it&#146;s 
              not just a style. It&#146;s a method. Who gave me permission? How 
              did I &quot;do&quot; it? As many questions as there are--here are 
              what I think are some answers: Desire, need, and the political-cultural 
              moment. Even reckless, but determined, I was willing to play and 
              fail--I was already an artist. Although it took me years more to 
              recognize this absolutely. What&#146;s going on? I could give you 
              a contradictory narrative. This would be very typical--compliant 
              and resistant me inventing (or addressing) something. I knew this 
              writing was risky--indeed &quot;The Pink Guitar&quot; essay discusses 
              some of the negative reactions of some fairly annoyed, and momentarily 
              powerful, people. (Some of whom were &quot;in charge of&quot; my 
              tenure for my academic job--and against it, too.) Not a joke--of 
              course there are potential negative impacts--some people are going 
              to hate what you do, and possibly think you are self-indulgent or 
              narcissistic (etc.) for choosing essay modes. Thus the risk of this 
              kind of expression--the joy of it--must overcome and swamp prudence 
              or narrow conceptions of what writing is, what a career is. Sometimes 
              you have to wait to feel safe. Safer. It is a very subtle and situational 
              decision. There is no simple &quot;answer&quot; that the past can 
              give the present on this issue. But if you can stand (or can survive) 
              that joyous impudence and imprudence, then proceed. But don&#146;t 
              forget that I was, during this same period, writing critical prose--in 
              <i>Writing Beyond the Ending</i> and <i>H.D.: The Career of that 
              Struggle</i>--prose and analyses that I also absolutely wanted to 
              write. No one was making me do it, as if one kind of writing is 
              better or truer or more authentic than another. </font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
              course, one is subject to professional pressures. If you jump track, 
              write another way, writing &quot;otherhow,&quot; you have to make 
              sure that all your kinds of writing are excellent, tested out, I 
              mean by an interior standard of solidity. That way if other people 
              hate it, you will know how to measure it for yourself, on your own.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So 
              I began with an essay not in <i>The Pink Guitar</i> (something from 
              1978 called &quot;Psyche, or, Wholeness&quot;) and then wrote &quot;For 
              the Etruscans.&quot; But it wasn&#146;t &quot;prewritten&quot;--it 
              was a negotiation with materials arrayed. It came about this way. 
              Having given a seminar at a Barnard Conference on Women and Society 
              on the question (not the certainty) of &quot;a&quot; female aesthetic--a 
              burning issue in 1979--I was asked to write it up. So I did. I now 
              see the commitment to multiple citation and to recording many of 
              the voices of that seminar as a mini-<i>Arcades</i>. A feminist 
              Benjaminian <i>Arcades</i>. Although I was committed to collaging 
              other people&#146;s voices with my own as only one among many, in 
              actuality it did not quite work out that way. Authorship is not 
              dissolved by fiat. But that is why the &quot;author&quot; of that 
              essay is myself and &quot;Workshop 9&quot;--the presence of interlocutors 
              was crucial.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
              was aware of using modernist &quot;devices&quot; for feminist purposes. 
              The fluid form of talking, the enormously excited and participatory 
              group of women for whom I was the seminar leader--writing into that 
              fervent and palpable and aroused and debating female space was crucial. 
              I was writing into a cultural and political need for analysis and 
              the collection of evidence. Thinking was a real situation. It was 
              a moment (this writing comes from a political and cultural moment). 
              There was nothing willed about it. There was a politics of culture, 
              and I was trying to name some part of it. But without distortion. 
              For I also did not try to falsify or distort what I thought: that 
              &quot;feminine&quot; writing tactics were the tactics that can be 
              chosen by any non-dominant group. The rhetorics are situational, 
              not essentialist strategies. This was not the popular finding then, 
              when we were, in general, in the full bloom of a dynamic and rather 
              absolute sense of female difference. Yet insofar as I was acting 
              oppositionally--refusing patriarchal culture as a choice, I also 
              chose to use the very rhetorics I discuss.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Letter 
              writing to friends. Free writing for poetry. These were some sources. 
              Teaching, as a social free association along the lines of investigation. 
              I think what I did, in these essays, was to invent an intersubjective 
              space, one between reader and text, between writer and reader, between 
              author and evidence, between analysis and need. A looping of response. 
              Not one of hierarchy or claims of controlling authority over a set 
              of materials. And the central strategy of modernism--collage--was 
              another source. I entered the practice of the field (a central strategy 
              of the postmodern)--the creation of an extent or an area, a site 
              in which things happen. Ludic things: Rhythms of apprehension. Stress 
              shifting. Changeups. Carnivalizing analytic discourses. Mongrel, 
              hybrid sounds. Placing the reader, as well as the writer, in a variety 
              of subject places. Faceting. Dissolving the author into the sounds 
              of the text. Making chaos, diversity, m&eacute;lange. Constructing 
              loose ends! Making there be a porous openness of thought, not a 
              sealing over of thought. There is a loft in this method--and it 
              is not just a style--it <u>is</u> a method. It is not willful writing 
              as in &quot;I will myself to do this because it would be a good 
              thing.&quot; It is writing poised as art is on the cusp of willful 
              willessness. To possess this possession, become dispossessed. </font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If 
              I chose to create desire, attention, loose ends, and an endless 
              intersubjectivity between others as equals (undo &quot;the&quot; 
              binary--I have no goal but this), then I am putting a little bit 
              of utopian change into writing. I am interested. I am interested 
              in this. To change the hard, hard heart. The essay is anti-patriarchal 
              writing as a method of investigation. The essay expresses the need 
              to make something that gives pleasure. That is, aesthetic pleasure 
              as political pleasure--transformation. To the degree that we all 
              live in some form of political, economic, sexual, social and intellectual 
              complicity with forms of the patriarchal, this choice of writing 
              might not be possible. Or seem possible. Yet it is possible. The 
              opening may be small. A pinhole. But it remains possible.</font></p>

              thinking about the questions posed by Mytili and Elisabeth for this 
              forum, I&#146;m struck by the (logical) necessity to frame these 
              questions in relation to <i>public</i> institutions &#151; be they 
              academic, publishing, or technological structures &#151; that determine 
              or shape the production and reception of our writing. Although the 
              &quot;personal&quot; is mentioned as an umbrella term (&quot;Is 
              inclusion of the personal a taboo, an innovation, or has it been 
              worn out by overuse?&quot;), the invitation to the forum does not 
              pose a host of questions about the personal to the extent that questions 
              are asked about the institutional pressures in our lives. I&#146;m 
              neither trying to assert a polarity between the private and the 
              public, nor suggesting that these questions do so, but am interested 
              in observing how much the &quot;personal&quot; or &quot;private&quot; 
              restlessly unsettles <i>all</i> of my imagined responses to the 
              host of questions so thoughtfully posed by this forum. I can&#146;t 
              begin to think of &quot;models of critical writing&quot; without 
              almost viscerally feeling the compressed time of my days, the need 
              to make use of time efficiently, the need not to waste words or 
              move in tangential directions because (like so many) I&#146;ve got 
              a kid to pick up (and any number of other realities might be inserted 
              here at the end of this sentence). </font></p>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Probably 
              this has to do with my schedule these days, with wanting to garden 
              but spending much of the day in my office trying to finish a manuscript 
              that never wants to end, while knowing my &quot;work day&quot; <i>will</i> 
              end when kindergarten ends, and that I need to make the oatmeal 
              cookies I promised for my daughter to take to her class for snack 
              tomorrow, and then I need to rush back to school for an evening 
              graduate seminar in &quot;Feminist Poetics,&quot; which seems a 
              remarkably wonderful and appropriate course to rush to after such 
              a day. But exhausting in rapid shifts and forms of attention. None 
              of this schedule is unique to me; and no event in the day is distinct, 
              finally, from any other. They echo into each other, and I think 
              of Virginia Woolf as I mash butter into sugar and explain measuring 
              to Chloe. (And of course think of Woolf&#146;s concern with how 
              &quot;Chloe&quot; is measured and learns to measure). And then I 
              think, how so very banal and typical and clich&eacute;d that I locate 
              my academic experience in relation to the domestic and the maternal, 
              and maybe even how self-centered, given this stage in my life. (I 
              would have written a different response ten years ago). And so I 
              undercut myself.</font></p>
            <p> 
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
              undercutting comes from somewhere, and I suspect it&#146;s related 
              to the training I&#146;ve received as an academic, which powerfully 
              prompts me to analyze my critical ground to the degree that much 
              gets censored. And what is interesting to me is not that everyone 
              should know about my daily life but that I censor its possibilities 
              for taking me somewhere in terms of my critical writing. I wonder 
              how I might more fully allow the echoes that go on throughout my 
              day, that carry soundings from one arena to another, to more fruitfully 
              be admitted into the <i>process</i> of critical writing, whether 
              or not the process shows up in the final product. Thinking back, 
              it&#146;s the essays that allow the process to show up (I just taught 
              DuPlessis&#146; &quot;For the Etruscans&quot; last night) that first 
              prompted me to consider how the essay form functions to contain 
              and censor; what I&#146;m interested in thinking about now is how 
              those efforts to contain and censor are internalized in my thought 
              processes. When I spoke earlier about &quot;different forms of attention,&quot; 
              I meant that the boundaries between ways of thinking so often descend 
              from the form of writing/creating we are doing, so that I <i>begin</i> 
              thinking in certain ways that differ depending on whether I am moving 
              toward an essay or a drawing or an oatmeal cookie or a chat with 
              my daughter. I&#146;d like to disturb that originary moment (which 
              isn&#146;t originary at all), in which the shapes of my thinking 
              are too often determined by the shape/genre/form of the product.</font></p>
            <p>
            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While 
              I love the &quot;innovative&quot; essay, I also realize I can&#146;t 
              focus on writing that essay as an <i>end</i> in itself. This has 
              partly to do with my own sense of insecurity and partly (largely) 
              to do with practical knowledge of the hierarchies of the academic 
              institutions in which I work. I&#146;ve read too many files as a 
              member of a search committee or a tenure committee. And we all know 
              that the ability to stand up at MLA, for instance, and read off 
              of a randomly arranged series of notecards is &quot;allowable&quot; 
              for only a few. I&#146;d like to think this won&#146;t always be 
              the case but in the meantime, I&#146;m trying to tackle the issue 
              from the other end &#151; where the essay gets started in our heads, 
              what shapes the directions we feel free to take or prohibited from 
              considering, what happens when a different focus of attention is 
              brought to the matter. </font></p>

            <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although 
              I like to think that a more permeable focus would help me not to 
              feel pulled in a million directions (and unfocused about most of 
              them), I also realize that many tasks in critical writing do involve 
              isolated, systematic, and synthetic processes that demand a comprehensive 
              grasp of an issue (and thus, lots of research, reading, thinking) 
              and an ability to situate a discussion in relation to other discussions. 
              I actually enjoy these processes, but at the same time they are 
              probably the most problematic for me when I think of issues of time 
              and writing, because they suck up time, lots of time. So, in deciding 
              how to choose my time, I most often find it imperative for professional 
              reasons to read that extra article, etc. rather than sit and write 
              in the kind of relaxed (which doesn&#146;t mean unfocused or unthoughtful) 
              manner I&#146;m enjoying right now. This choice is intensified by 
              the overwhelming amount of information available now, and the difficulty 
              of letting go of the notion that I have to keep up with everything. 
              Technology terrifies me in this way, because it presents itself 
              in my life as a way of demanding more from my time, asking that 
              I keep track of and make use of more information. My own terror, 
              I&#146;m sure, closes me off to many of the benefits of technology 
              and of the web, and perhaps as time eases up I can also relax in 
              front of the computer. Who knows. And so, it&#146;s now time to 
              turn off the computer and pick up Chloe. No cookies today, but maybe 
              a little PBS and some time in the yard before class tonight, thinking 
              about Erica Hunt and matters of the sandbox.</font></p>
