      <p> <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The buried speech that creates a soundless gap between 
        languages is at the heart of translation. This is one reason why a sentence 
        in a French novel cannot be directly represented </font><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">by 
        a sentence in the novel's English translation. The Reality of language 
        A, with its rules and regulations, its strategies for creating affect, 
        is <i>de facto</i> in denial of any other Reality, including the Reality 
        of language B. Some translators overcome this by thinking of the original 
        text as a <i>corpus delicti</i>. I prefer to think of the work of translation 
        as metonymy, two languages working in extension, each of the other. To 
        make <i>Laurence</i> sound in English as it does in French--with its breathless 
        run-on French phrasing-- the majority of sentences had to be turned around 
        completely. There is an Alice-in-the-looking-glass kind of "Reality" to 
        the relationship between the two versions. Before they could be turned, 
        they had to be heard. They further had to be made small, cast at a distance, 
        because <i>Laurence</i> is a series of miniature tableaux. There were, 
        of course, many agreeable meetings with the author, with whom I have done 
        collaborative projects for more than a decade, particularly on questions 
        of language and gender. Authorial proximity, or at least cultural proximity, 
        i.e. a sense of cultural particularities and cadences, helps address the 
        pull towards, the memory of, "the natural" which still haunts the novel 
        form. I think of this as putting body sounds into syntax. The translation 
        has chiefly been appreciated by feminists</font><font size=2>.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>&#9;Les 
        Miserables</i> was the book of books. Laurence, in the manner of people 
        for whom reading is a trial demanding tremendous concentration, even studious 
        effort, applied herself like a schoolgirl. Every page reverberates with 
        Victor Hugo&#8217;s humanness, his refusal to stand in judgment. The author 
        constantly iterates his pact with the disenfranchised. Laurence saw him 
        as a father, an exemplary figure, the kind an adult woman needed, a man 
        who fed her hunger for meaning, for a point of reference to counterbalance 
        the meaninglessness of existence. The book does not damn people who steal 
        bread, nor unwed mothers, nor prostitutes, yet praises a bishop&#8217;s misunderstood 
        generosity, and refuses to avenge the weak. It is about removing shackles, 
        obstacles to a new future, about opening a door onto new possibilities, 
        turning points. The poor are granted no respite, only passing triumphs. 
        The story offers appeasement, and, for a reader like Laurence, hope of 
        ultimate reconciliation with the world around her.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Hugo&#8217;s 
        fresco of symbols, myths, beliefs, attitudes, social movements, wars of 
        conquest, insurrections, opened her mind wider to the idea of fighting 
        against her own ignorance, instead of taking refuge in the irrational 
        thinking, in airy-fairy notions, or even religious teachings. Victor Hugo 
        seemed to her as knowledgeable as he was tolerant. She confronted her 
        lack of learning without abjection, eager to understand. The novel became 
        less a work of fiction than an amalgam of references to history, to philosophy, 
        to the study of language, custom, attitudes, and political and legal structures. 
        The author&#8217;s wealth of wisdom was contained in his book. Her admiration 
        for the novelist sustained her effort, and she finished what she had started, 
        despite the book&#8217;s lengthy digressions, its occasional erudition, its 
        frequent historical parentheses, which added depth to the unraveling plot.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Her 
        own experience in her own social milieu was the result of a background 
        that placed her in a similar paradigm, rubbed her up against the same 
        questions. Why are we complaisant? Why are we so suspicious of strangers? 
        Why does the city inspire fear? Religion&#8217;s promise of eternal punishment 
        kept the sinner in a state of passivity. Women&#8217;s sexuality, explicitly 
        and implicitly an object of apprehension, caution and future malediction, 
        denatured the body, cheapening it with gross childish terms. There was 
        no correspondence between words regarding one&#8217;s sexual practice and the 
        terms she had learned in physiological textbooks. She was perfectly aware 
        of how unwed mothers were discriminated against, of how they were punished 
        allegedly to atone for their sins. She grew certain that prostitutes, 
        unwed mothers, carefree delinquents like Gavroche and stealers of bread, 
        did not upset the social order, were victims of a prevailing punitive 
        moralism so entrenched that the troubling ideas of Victor Hugo were not 
        transmittable to the majority.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Ignorance, 
        prejudices, and attitudes that caused fear and suspicion made social peace 
        impossible.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Victor 
        Hugo&#8217;s epic story embraces history. The universe of war, a totally male 
        domain, caught Laurence&#8217;s interest. She had heard Leon speak of war. The 
        little girl did not have her head in the sand. A threat had hovered over 
        the house as they spoke of the eldest boy who would soon reach the age 
        of conscription. The father pointed out the names of boys in the canton, 
        followed the reports in the newspaper. The war sucked up the vitality 
        of the region, served up nameless youth as canon fodder. She grew interested 
        in stories of older countries, in the history of Europe, riddled with 
        wars.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Laurence 
        ruminated over what caused wars. War, an absurdity presided over by men, 
        had disastrous consequences for all. She focused on the economic aspects. 
        Armed conflict was the surest way to impoverish people, to deprive a country 
        of its sons, disorganize its material life for the gain of the few: politicians, 
        generals, who grew rich on everyone&#8217;s backs.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        father&#8217;s words had a certain resonance in the social upheavals related 
        by Victor Hugo. A crook gains the reputation of a hero, a former convict 
        saves the ideals they are supposed to be defending. There follows a general 
        chaos which affects the civilian population. It is held hostage, becomes 
        the quarry from which taxes are extorted.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        love scenes, dominated by female characters, pointed to a gender distinction, 
        implying that women and pathos were one and the same. What did she have 
        in common with Fantine, a pretty orphan girl? She knew they existed, these 
        girls kept by lovers, abandoned when they got pregnant so the men could 
        marry girls of their own class. She knew all about the secret lives of 
        young girls from the country, maids in bourgeois home, promised jewels, 
        money, the chance to climb the social ladder. When she went dancing at 
        the Chateau Frontenac, she noticed girls from humble backgrounds mixing 
        with the rich boys, being taken out by them, having a good time.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She 
        knew nothing of fairy tales, romantic novels, melodramas, never read the 
        hagiographies that had fascinated Aline. She never bothered to take a 
        book from the nuns&#8217; shelves, for she was persuaded that their purpose 
        was to indoctrinate readers, to make devout Christians of them.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Fantine&#8217;s 
        good time turned to bad. Laurence was reminded of Estell Haley, her passionate 
        love affair, her suicide. Estell&#8217;s constant solicitude for her parents 
        was not commensurate with the family&#8217;s rejection of her. A huge gap opened 
        in Laurence&#8217;s understanding. She could tell it was about the baseness 
        of existence; instead of dwelling on it, she grew more determined. When 
        wracked by a desire for intimacy, she glossed over it, using a prudish 
        vocabulary. The isolation experienced by young girls appeared insurmountable.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Cosette&#8217;s 
        naive happiness, her being adopted and cared for by Jean Valjean, makes 
        innocence seem childish. He protects her, sparing her the secret of her 
        origins and of the checkered past of her mentor. Laurence knew that being 
        born a bastard was something people kept hidden. Victor Hugo waxed eloquent 
        on their right to happiness, even if it offended prevailing morality. 
        Cosette was the personification of the young well-protected girl, spared 
        knowledge of her disgraced, mean beginnings. Marvelous things happen to 
        her. Her and her mother&#8217;s early misfortunes are made up for; the troubles 
        of Jean Valjean, vindicated. True justice offers restitution for misery. 
        Laurence believed such a justice would exist for future generations. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For women, 
        well-being depended upon whether or not they were accompanied in life. 
        Their dependent state didn&#8217;t make them second-class citizens. Laurence 
        did not cast judgment on women, did not see in the lot that befell them 
        a sign of weakness.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Happiness 
        requires the presence of the feminine, is made complete by the feminine&#8217;s 
        pleasing, soothing qualities. An unnatural woman like Cosette&#8217;s wicked 
        nurse, la Thenardier, seems uglier, more vile and dangerous than a man. 
        A woman, whether angel, devil, or weak-willed slave of her feelings, never 
        changes, is a creature of instinct, of her nature, which is immutable. 
        La Thenardier knows how to lay snares, knows how to keep her eyes open, 
        to take advantage of people. No woman makes empty gestures, except the 
        prostitute, Fantine, who sells her hair and her teeth to support her child, 
        but what she gives of herself is not enough. Dispossessed of her beauty, 
        hunted down, weakened by illness, she dies. Her story is a melodrama, 
        a sad tale to stir the imagination of girls. Victor Hugo does not believe 
        in the emancipation of women. His humanism is of the paternalistic variety.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Laurence&#8217;s 
        identification with Jean Valjean was not a comment on the female characters. 
        He is a solitary figure trying to survive, and he succeeds. Jean Valjean 
        is not ambitious, lives by no rule book. Because he is among society&#8217;s 
        outcasts, such things never occur to him.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        hero, like Laurence, is born poor. Guilty in the eyes of the law, he cannot 
        avoid the consequences. It could have been otherwise. Poverty breeds crime. 
        Misery wears an iron yoke, the cloak of servitude. There is no such thing 
        as a needy person who lets a day go by without noting he is poor, even 
        when he no longer is. Poverty is a state of mind. Jean Valjean cannot 
        really deny who he is. Being a fugitive from justice serves as a constant 
        reminder. During his years of wandering, he is confounded by his desire 
        for revenge. Hardened by life, he takes advantage of everyone he can, 
        even a child. Violence engenders fear from which one can&#8217;t escape, except 
        by committing more crimes. He learns at last, to live with his lack of 
        freedom, without bitterness, without envy, forever conscious of the need 
        to be on his guard. He runs more than he walks, develops a sixth sense 
        for danger. Since he must not draw attention to his person, to his cornered, 
        shut-in self, he hones his talents, relies on his brains. He doesn&#8217;t waste 
        time polishing his personality.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Laurence 
        refused to conceive of herself as stymied, ensnared. She didn&#8217;t obey rules 
        she considered silly, was forever dissenting, and would do anything she 
        had to do to get out of an unpromising situation.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The hero 
        was the personification of a solid man, capable of doing without, never 
        wasting energy. She identified with the physical stamina that underscored 
        his well-balanced mind, and helped him ride roughshod over fears and inhibitions.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">She reflected 
        that people are born with different degrees of energy. Energy was both 
        a gift and a determining factor. She was born active and resourceful, 
        as others were born passive and floundering. You couldn&#8217;t change these 
        things, they forged your destiny. In her opinion, very little was determined 
        by the individual self. External factors were brought to bear on a variety 
        of personal configurations. The absence of real freedom didn&#8217;t prevent 
        one from action. On the contrary, it was what one was born with that limited 
        choices in life.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;For 
        a long time Laurence had copied, imitated, adopted the ideas and behaviours 
        of others. There had been Eduouard, who had involved her in the planning 
        of his farm. He was her favourite for the simple reason that he had an 
        ideal, a desire to better himself, was ambitious. Solid and consistent, 
        Edouard had a nose for business. His desire to succeed buoyed her and 
        for a long time she shared his dreams, with conviction.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;One 
        day while they were digging potatoes, Edouard was called on for help by 
        a neighbour whose horse had become enmired, and she continued on her own, 
        her bare hands feeling for the tubers that she tossed, one after the other, 
        into baskets. Several nights of frost meant they had no time to lose, 
        for the potatoes were the first crop from the land her brother had just 
        bought. She was always ready to work for Edouard, for they were accomplices 
        to the point that the land seemed to be hers as well as his. She worked 
        there in a different way than on her father&#8217;s land, propelled by a pact 
        between two young people who owned something that represented a step toward 
        freedom. The sun was setting and no sign of Edouard. Laurence felt her 
        fatigue, her knees on the ground, back bent, hands moving with rapid perseverance. 
        She went faster rather than letting her rhythm grow sluggish, her gestures 
        mechanical, forgetting her body. The more numb her wrists felt, the harder 
        she worked. The cracked skin on her finger joints were bleeding. Edouard 
        still hadn&#8217;t appeared. She finished her task: the whole field had yielded 
        its harvest of potatoes. She was unable to straighten up entirely. Not 
        having drunk anything, she was thirsty from eating dust, her lips chapped, 
        her tongue thick in her mouth. Her face was black with earth, her throat 
        covered in sweat. Spurred on by the idea that it was urgent to complete 
        the job, she had pulled up every potato. She measured time by the five 
        or six hours spent waiting for Edouard under the September sun. She was 
        three miles from the house. She walked, dead beat, partly happy about 
        what she had accomplished, partly put out by the brother whom she suddenly 
        caught sight of chatting with the neighbour. She was so hurt she kept 
        on walking, dazed at the thought he was taking advantage of her. She expected 
        him to thank her. He did not. Edouard was like other men, taking one for 
        granted when it suited him.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Laurence 
        bore no grudge against him. One could always use her, for a time. The 
        brother&#8217;s selfishness was part and parcel of his masculinity. The neccessity 
        of believing in the future won out, and she continued to have a high opinion 
        of him.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Dr. 
        Fournier&#8217;s memory evoked feeling cozy under a cold sky filled with wind 
        and snow that obfuscated the roads. They took off in a clean sleigh, heated 
        with hot bricks under their feet, covered with furs and rugs, a basket 
        full of food stowed away, complete with a thermos of coffee, without knowing 
        when they would return. She was never cold or hungry at Beaupre. The doctor 
        drove carefully over the packed snow, over new layers of heavy or soft 
        snowfall, over ice. He enjoyed the meticulous rituals of his profession, 
        identified with his art; his person and practice were one. Time didn&#8217;t 
        matter. He had learned the importance of comfort, the better to forget 
        oneself on behalf of the patients. The nuns spoke of vocation, of devotion, 
        but not the doctor. Though he devoted himself to his work, he referred 
        to it as a practice, refusing to make of science a question of morals. 
        When illness struck, social inequality was a non-issue. He went when he 
        was called, ignored the religious edict to save the child rather than 
        the mother. His medical practice had a human dimension compared to that 
        of the nuns, who saw illness as divine intervention or a message from 
        on high, and, who, in their practice, proclaimed the need for rules of 
        conscience, self-sacrifice, abnegation. The yoke of sacrifice had no currency 
        at Beaupre, thus removing a useless burden that only resulted in self-pity.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        uneven road grades along the banks of the river, the deep woods somewhere 
        beyond which were little farms, made every expedition different. Duty 
        obliged them to travel long hours. The precise pensive man found the young 
        woman&#8217;s exuberance and constant good humour touching. They influenced 
        each other, reciprocally.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        Fournier household ran on a schedule adapted to the husband&#8217;s professional 
        needs. He was the centre of gravity around which the women turned. Laurence 
        didn&#8217;t imagine that it could be any other way. She idealized the peaceful 
        harmony, the role played by women&#8212;including herself&#8212;in the smooth running 
        of things. Thus, she justified her autonomy.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Laurence 
        had long copied the behaviour of certain men, using them as role models. 
        Edouard had taught her how to think in terms of the future, avoiding the 
        rigidity that led to defeatism, that kept one mired in the past. Edouard 
        had toiled for fifteen years to establish a machine-run farm, and his 
        gamble had paid off. The announcement that he would soon marry the woman 
        who was the same age as he, the one from Leeds, a good housekeeper, proper, 
        to say the least, did not particularly move her one way or the other. 
        Love and marriage were not the same thing for Laurence. She had loved 
        and his name was Gaston. Otherwise, people&#8217;s marital pledges left her 
        indifferent. In this, she mimed the father,who had never alluded outright 
        to either sex or love. If Rosalie and Leon did not address each other 
        as Papa and Maman, but persisted in using their Christian names, it was 
        because it was natural for them to keep a respectful distance from one 
        another. Rosalie did not take Leon&#8217;s arm when she walked with him. In 
        church they sat close, due to the crowded benches. Though the children 
        saw animals coupling, human procreation remained a mystery to them. Marriage 
        was what one spoke of, not suspect desire, not that deceitful hidden glint 
        in the eye called love. There was a gap between the two. Two bodies side-by-side 
        evoked sex, and Leon couldn&#8217;t look at a young man and a young girl sitting 
        close on a bench. He flew into a rage of irrational proportions, betrayed 
        by his tormented expression, his agitation, his snarling.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Had 
        Gaston influenced Laurence? In him she had found a kindred spirit. He 
        had said: you have to try everything once, a little musical phrase that 
        rocked her to sleep. Like herself, he was forever amazed. Even his sporty 
        attitude, his frank, relaxed manner, was not unlike her own. She would 
        have liked to somehow translate his masculinity into the feminine, to 
        mine his debonair manner. This was not yet possible in relations between 
        women.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sometimes 
        she adopted the male viewpoint, imitated their good sides. Those whom 
        she respected became points of reference, but she didn&#8217;t make a rule of 
        it. Better than that, she took what she needed from the men who were her 
        role models.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Her 
        reading of <i>Les Miserables</i> broadened her mind, made her more principled. 
        Jean Valjean struggles, protects his freedom which freedom is granted 
        by the author rather than by society at large. Victor Hugo&#8217;s pen makes 
        of him the archetype of men maltreated and misjudged by their peers. Unfortunate 
        from the start, he is destined to wander for years, to be decisive, to 
        think before he acts, and to fight for the right to a peaceful existence 
        with his loved ones, a very legitimate desire. There were countless Jean 
        Valjeans, men and women without means, kept down by religious and social 
        mores, doomed to despair by the economic crisis.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;For 
        once and for all, Laurence saw through the father&#8217;s lofty phrases, promising 
        eternal life in exchange for suffering in silence, for not uttering a 
        word, even to those around you. The power of his preaching had been such 
        that no one was allowed to look reality in the face, a reality that he 
        misrepresented for the sake of his own honour and moral standards. She 
        gave herself permission to see things as she saw fit.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Had 
        she had female role models, she who identified neither with Fantine nor 
        Cosette? Her mother, in the shadow of the man she admired, cultivated 
        the art of silence. Rosalie subdued the children out of respect for the 
        father, ordered them to be quiet as soon as he entered the house. Amanda 
        spread a white cloth on the table. The women fussed over Leon when he 
        appeared, obeying tradition to the letter.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Rosalie&#8217;s 
        patience in the training of her daughter was invaluable. Laurence knew 
        how to get things done without a thousand useless questions or pointless 
        objections. She threw herself wholly into a task, mind focused on the 
        movement of her hands. Patience comes from resignation, but also from 
        perseverance, which is a kind of wisdom.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;There 
        had been Sister Agnes, who had taught her French, had got her into nursing 
        school, a kind woman with a positive outlook. She had understood Laurence&#8217;s 
        aspirations, hadn&#8217;t repudiated her on the grounds of suspect motives such 
        as envy or small-mindedness. Women&#8217;s qualities, due to their feminine 
        natures, were considered weak compared to those of men, propelled by self-will. 
        Laurence knew she had a strong character, even if she often went as the 
        wind blew. In her opinion, prerogative was not the unique preserve of 
        men. She adopted certain male behaviours, without bothering about whether 
        they were suitable for a woman. She neither disdained nor rejected what 
        she could learn from them. But though she felt no domain was closed to 
        her as a woman, she would not have wanted, for anything in the world, 
        to cause her father embarrassment. She was proud as he, but was also human 
        in a way that he could never be.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She 
        found in Jean Valjean, who was sensitive to others, to their way of being, 
        a plausible model, a source of inspiration. She had fled her family a 
        second time, and for good. She shouldn&#8217;t hold their treatment of her against 
        them, she told herself. She opened herself, heart and mind, to a book, 
        had a private dialogue with it that helped her confront her own reality. 
        The book&#8217;s influence was powerful, direct, and filled her with an explicable 
        desire to share it with others.</font></p>

          <p> <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Will 
            the future come? It seems that we may almost ask this question when 
            we see such terrible shadow. Sullen face-to-face of the selfish and 
            miserable. On the part of the selfish, prejudices, the darkness of 
            the education of wealth, appetite increasing through intoxication, 
            a stupefaction of prosperity which deafens, a dread of suffering which, 
            with some, is carried even to aversion for sufferers, an implacable 
            satisfaction, the me so puffed up that it closes the soul; on the 
            part of the miserable, covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others 
            enjoy, the deep yearnings of the human animal towards the gratifications,

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<a name="text2"></a>The 
        meekness religion taught her in childhood made it impossible to conceive 
        of the rich as people who committed all sorts of crimes. She dreamed of 
        affluence come by honestly, so people wouldn&#8217;t look down on her, as they 
        did on those down in Broughton, whose moral precepts kept them in their 
        place. She was unable to avoid the growing feeling, itself a kind of creed, 
        that her own happiness was inconceivable as long as they remained destitute.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She 
        remembered how isolated she had felt in the rich mansion on Cote-Sainte-Catherine, 
        worse than when she was behind convent walls. the conflict awakened in 
        her by Victor Hugo hadn&#8217;t been resolved, seemed, on the contrary, more 
        intense.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Laurence 
        had started reading without any preconceived ideas, knowing nothing about 
        novels, though sensitive to words. She gobbled up words with the hunger 
        of someone who had never read, had never entered a library or bookstore, 
        tackling the mystery of language that leads one to one&#8217;s self. For a Catholic, 
        unfamiliar with fairy tales, romance novels, a book had something of the 
        biblical, though she had never read the Bible either. The idea of the 
        Book as something containing the sum total of human experience was always 
        in the back of her mind. Laurence, who was looking for an oracle, a sage, 
        a philosopher, found them all in the magician Victor Hugo. She admired 
        him, he revealed the impenetrable truth of the human heart. His words 
        were a subtle mix, exorcizing the cruelty of destiny and advocating the 
        possibility of peace, in the end. A woman of her situation, no less than 
        a man, could not bear the triumph of evil. His words consoled her, comforted 
        her,and she believed in the progress of good, in the possibility of true 
        communion between people.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;<i>Les 
        Miserables</i> opened one to the possibility of human mercy, tolerance 
        instead of punitiveness: the novel was an anti-Bible. The authoritarianism, 
        the rigid intransigence of her education were reframed, and she welcomed 
        these words that redressed injustice and helped her justify her flights 
        from the family.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        novel didn&#8217;t awake a desire to read, it satisfied it. The effort expended 
        in reading was rewarded, and she was convinced that evil could give birth 
        to good. The narrow-mindedness of her origins no longer seemed like a 
        moral blemish, but a matter of attitude. <i>It&#8217;s all they know</i>...became 
        her favourite phrase. She excused them.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;It took 
        common sense to see the relationship between the book and reality, to 
        switch mentally from one to the other. She thought about how things were 
        represented. It became a game to improve on the novel&#8217;s ending, to plead 
        in favour of the right to happiness. Words she didn&#8217;t understand added 
        depth to those she did. A reader who reads word-by-word grasps the poetry 
        of a work. If she persisted to the end, which was her way with any undertaking, 
        she saw the job of reading as comparable to other work.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Laurence 
        had satisfied her curiosity as far as books were concerned. She intuited 
        that no other book would teach her what <i>Les Miserables</i> had. She 
        had read the Book that contained all other books.</font></p>
