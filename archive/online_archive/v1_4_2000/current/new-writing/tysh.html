      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The sentences 
        are stretched out on the white page with their terrible story of evicting 
        the father, the hideous truth of the paternal trampled until its name 
        hangs naked, mere shreds.The child and the mother arrange themselves in 
        the vacant space, suddenly dizzy under their common aversion for bourgeois 
        <i>biens&eacute;ance</i>, i.e. what sits well with the good people. Pierre 
        and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne practice a new conjugation: irregular, indecent 
        and deeply corruptive. In truth, these impossible words have already effected 
        one transport, from French to English, none too worse for wear. I hail 
        them now, their divine laughter, the stupendous hell of their flesh, their 
        abject logic. Like a seamstress puckering her lips I outfit them with 
        images, I pinch and tuck; I undress and invent. Docile bodies, they go 
        on, all the same, never forgetting the irrespirable air that is their 
        due. In the cinematic light of my recutting, I dispatch the brides to 
        be. From behind I look at them fading into black.</font></p>
