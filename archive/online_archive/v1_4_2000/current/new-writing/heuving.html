      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Gaudy 
        Night </i>is the last section of my recently finished mixed genre manuscript, 
        <i>Snowball, </i>an anti-portrait of the artist as a young woman. I composed 
        <i>Gaudy Night </i>in part by drawing up lists of several sentences that 
        I liked from three different novels, utilizing respectively Dorothy Sayers' 
        <i>Gaudy Night, </i>Emily Bronte's <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and Marguerite 
        Duras' <i>The Ravishing of Lol Stein. </i> I melded words, phrases, and 
        occasionally entire sentences together along with new writing into sentences. 
        In composing <i>Guady Night,</i> it was important for me to hear an evolving 
        syntax in advance of writing each sentence, letting words, images, themes 
        cluster on the roping sentence as they would. Occasionally I quote an 
        entire, unabridged sentence from these novels as well as other sources, 
        including my own writing in previous sections in <i>Snowball.</i> Each 
        of the fourteen sections of <i>Gaudy Night</i> was written to be about 
        a page in length.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;To begin 
        with the expectation of the fully completed sentence according to my whim 
        firmly in view. While Harriet told her story, he fidgeted restlessly about 
        the room, avoiding the broken glass and ivory on the floor with the automatic 
        precision of a cat, and stood at length with his back to her. Her back 
        to the assignation or was it his face in perpetual profile. Should she 
        wish to write a more involved sentence she might sequester herself in 
        the working out of its crannies and jewels. Should the tears of the crying 
        woman emerald her throat with their sudden precision. Town seemed remarkably 
        empty and uninteresting, a safe haven or dangerous beach. The beachhead 
        of Mr. Pomfret's simple minded proposal elated her but now she was surprised 
        by how she needed to alter his face, while all the while the first two 
        communications were put firmly into the hands of Miss Vane. She ought 
        to be blaming herself for not having seen what was happening to Mr. Pomfret 
        and taken steps to stop it. Cat Street was crossed and the shadows of 
        New College walls swallowed them up before she spoke. Then later, the 
        first two communications came in the hands of Miss Vane. X misreading 
        'H.D. Vane' as 'H.D. Vine' put the note in the wrong gown. The rarely 
        folding bulldogs had been having a lively time with the tree climbers 
        in St. Giles and were now out for blood and now came through the archway 
        at a smart trot. Then, as they came close, she realized it was Annie, 
        looking strange without her cap and apron, taking the children for a walk. 
        The beachhead of the yellowing square rectangle of childhood grass confirmed 
        very little. An ant hill of bugles or black whores descending over the 
        parchment as the trumpeter and his clandestine band of green men slowly 
        approached the fen in the wooded vale. It could have been them as well 
        as anyone else now arriving at the beachhead of want and destruction, 
        of epaulets and apples. Should then it should not have been anything anyone 
        would have wanted but which now all clamoured for in the want of their 
        own destruction of incessant rains. Absent rains, now absent winds, and 
        what else could Harriet voice but the broken glass even though she had 
        the precision of a cat and was avoiding it. Cat Street was crossed and 
        the shadows of New College walls swallowed them up before she spoke.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">II.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Happily, 
        after the first devastating fury, she found the relief of bad language. 
        The next piece of news was that a violent quarrel had taken place between 
        Miss Shaw and Miss Stevens, who were normally the closest of friends. 
        The Proctor's bull dogs, who had been having a lively time with the tree 
        climbers in St. Giles and were now out for blood, had come through the 
        archway at a smart trot, and seeing a young gentleman, not only engage 
        in nocturnal vagation without his gown, but actually embracing a female, 
        leapt gleefully upon him, as upon lawful prey. Town seemed remarkably 
        empty and uninteresting as behind closed doors square rooms with sequestered 
        inhabitants pitted their somnambulant gestures. Without vaccinations, 
        the town children could hardly be expected to be lead to water much less 
        to drink of the distilled pool garnered in their parents' white, unblinking 
        eyes. If only there could be some leakage to this incredibly beautiful 
        day that went on in full awareness of its misgivings beyond her glassed 
        in passageway. Yet, she thought, there was no use to orchestrate what 
        would like spillways in the dead of night only further their own momentum 
        in the draft of waylaid schedules in the Western United States. The Warden, 
        seated in a deep chair near the fireplace, gave nobody any help, albeit 
        they were all trying as hard as cats on a glassy mountain. Should shame 
        like a wooden spatula be pushed under her tongue she doubted she would 
        have the courage to continue rewarding herself with her own desserts. 
        It had been a long year and now on her yellow lined pad of legal paper 
        she sought to spell a gaudy hotel with its cases of jewels poorly protected 
        in safes that were easily tripped. Memory's long assay provided not a 
        little difficulty as she clung to each scrap as to a morsel, especially 
        now that Cat Street was crossed and the shadows of New College walls swallowed 
        them up. If only the beachhead and Mr. Pomfret remained in sight as well 
        as all the others, with Annie at the helm, continuing their long and torturous 
        ascent of the Matterhorn. She ought to be blaming herself for not having 
        seen what was happening to Mr. Pomfret and taken steps to stop it. It 
        mattered little but for the jewels in her throat and her eyelashes studded 
        with sponges. There was no love, or all the love she could ever want, 
        if only before having children she could amass all the fame and independence 
        she would ever need, and at last settle down like a cat with a fur muff 
        worn around his throat for the extra warmth. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">III.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The belief 
        was, of course, not susceptible to proof, but the possibility was suggestive. 
        The terrible accouchement had begun and with it the news of Peter. It 
        was quite true that the spontaneous affections of Reggie Pomfret had somehow 
        made it easier to believe that Peter's own feelings might be something 
        more than an artist's tenderness for his own achievement. She was surprised 
        by how she needed to alter his face, when only much later, the first two 
        communications came into the hands of one Miss Vane, mispelled Miss Vine. 
        While Harriet told her story he fidgeted restlessly about the room, avoiding 
        the broken glass and ivory on the floor with the automatic precision of 
        a cat, and stood at length with his back toward her. Now pushed against 
        the fence with bombers buzzing overhead, she wished to return to the scene 
        of the maple grappling the hard yellow turf with its gnarled roots and 
        thirst for rains. She wanted the tenderness of cardboard boxes in the 
        full swing of sandbags of midwesterners in search of rains. She had been 
        so cut off that little would avail her in this time of misplaced intentions 
        and absent winds. Her back to the assignation or was it her face in perpetual 
        profile. Cat Street was crossed and the shadows of New College walls swallowed 
        them up before she spoke. With enough elbow grease even this would gleam. 
        Her cat gazed at her lovingly, his whiskers shining in the lamplight, 
        with all the admonition of someone hungry for the banquet to begin. Crossing 
        Cat Street without even a backward look in her direction, he presumed 
        to scan the sky. The beachhead would never be landed nor aeroplanes gunned 
        from the story. In the slow squish of mud mud, the rubies would be crushed, 
        pockmarked with blood. Only her throat fully exposed like the king's men 
        broken necks in this welter of white washed tree trunks and flashing amulets. 
        Full of ancient jibes and scabbards. She cheerfully opened the gates wide 
        to the marauding army. But how to drift to Annie, looking strange without 
        her eyes and apron, taking the children for a walk. Army ants, like black 
        whores descended over the parchment, marauding peacocks with delicate 
        cinched waists and torn maroon lace cascading over thighs. Hurt eyes indenting 
        tails on spread skirts. She had much to say to Miss Vane, or was it Miss 
        Vine, who prodded her with little ammunition except her own boredom and 
        desire to get on with it. Then there was Vera's situation on which she 
        longed to express herself although she dared not mention it in the company 
        of others.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IV.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Then 
        as they came close, she realized it was Annie looking strange without 
        her cap and gown. Now that she had happened on this distant platform, 
        she idly wondered what had happened to the jewel thief who had somehow 
        disappeared in the new moon. If only in this strange wash of days she 
        could immerse herself in a recliner so that she could barely wonder. Wasn't 
        it here for which she had been aiming from the start in the long craze 
        of fish caps and bottle necks. Her feet on the hassock with the grinning 
        gargoyles. She could not get over the feeling of having returned from 
        the dead. Coming upon a particularly beautiful place of washed out ditches 
        she would think that if she had been dead a long time and now had suddenly 
        come back to life how grateful she would be for all her old life and the 
        frazzle of barbecues and rough hewn waters. Little more aided her never 
        again. All the while the world went on in super animated color with great 
        energy and compactness in the crunch of superannuated liaisons and lively 
        bodies without pudenda. The beachhead of Mr. Pomfret's simple minded proposal 
        elated her, while all the while the first two communications were put 
        firmly into the hands of Miss Vane. The weather vine twirled in the flush 
        of brisk winks. It appeared that he was lunching with the Master and that 
        one of the All Souls men was lunching also. Overhead wires creating a 
        magnetic field and earthquake danger. Happily after the first devastating 
        fury, she found the relief of bad language. One by one the spurs of talk 
        failed and died leaving the one tenor floating like a solo instrument, 
        executing a cadenza when the orchestra had fallen silent. Peter, she felt 
        sure, could hear the whole intricate pattern, every part separately and 
        simultaneously, each independent and equal, separate but inescapable, 
        moving over and under, ravishing heart and mind together. Town seemed 
        remarkably empty and uninteresting, a safe haven or beach. The beachhead 
        of Mr. Pomfret's simple minded proposal elated her but now she was surprised 
        by how she needed to alter his face. If only she could drift to Annie 
        and all the rest of them in the full swing of sandbags and tender cardboard 
        boxes. Descending, she gave way to sudden dearth and decaying aneurysms 
        of the least common denominator. </font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        beachhead of Mr. Pomfret's simple minded proposal elated her, but now 
        she was surprised at how she needed to alter his face. His back to the 
        assignation or was it her face in perpetual profile. All the while she 
        was backing into the corner of the livery, the huge gelded horses stomping 
        their steamy breath into the chill morning stare. Should she instead have 
        gone forward into the rainy morning how far her travels would have carried 
        her into the inauspicious dawn. Her face to the assignation or was it 
        his back in perpetual profile. Longings fully written in a miniature book 
        of scrunched script and hemorrhaging eyes. If only she could fully inhabit 
        that boxed in space and never any new disturbance incise her with fresh 
        agility ever again. The tears of the crying woman emeralding her throat 
        with their sudden precision, if it were not for the propriety of incessant 
        rains. Still she sought the soft swing of sandbags in the boxed in place 
        of her pudendum and eyes. Dark and true and tender is the North, but one 
        needs to remember Gaudy. Then there was Vera's sedition on which she longed 
        to expound if only the electrical high wires did not threaten to topple 
        her square footing in a sudden earthquake excursion. My Susannah, this 
        terse compartmented box of magnetic powers and runnerless drawers. The 
        magic of a sutured place with the cicatrix coated in mercurachrome decorating 
        the captured activity. The High Seas made rent of the poor tenement district 
        as Cat Street was crossed and the shadows of New College walls swallowed 
        them up before she parceled herself in jeweled drams. If only the Room 
        of her single minded intention with its checkered floor tiles would wrest 
        the waves from their destructive path. To be there each day only until 
        the dawn of a new moon. Thus also my desire for a studio space, a work 
        space, which I blissfully inhabit. She could hardly have predicted her 
        fall, so fatefully had she wheeled her bike up the small abutment and 
        onto the hardened path, where a few scraggly weeds rose up to meet her 
        head. Again, it was summer and she longed to contain herself in the slow 
        caterwaul of work days of incessant radios and baggy winds. And so, she 
        began the cadenza of much maladroit and hope. And Peter, at any rate, 
        had no niche, in the grey stones of Oxford.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">VI.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The 
        evidence should be handed over to Miss Vane, as the only person in the 
        room who cannot possibly come under suspicion. At first we thought to 
        entrust Annie, but later it seemed Miss Vane, with the interesting half 
        turned face, should be our object of deposit. A curious woman, Miss de 
        Vine, and undoubtedly with a varied experience behind those disconcerting 
        eyes. Dark and true and tender is the North, and for that reason they've 
        made a special effort for Gaudy. Should she have gone forward instead 
        of backward, who knows how far her travels would have taken her on this 
        rainy summer morning, also Friday. And Peter, at any rate, had no niche, 
        in the grey stones of Oxford. She, for her part, entered room after room, 
        of much maladroit and affection, each more interior than the last, until 
        she was panning over the vast reaches of the Gobi Desert. The small indentations 
        of color on the linoleum floor reminded her of long afternoons tracing 
        rivulets like insects jutting irregularly to the north. They plunged their 
        articulated bodies over cracks, climbed the pointy blue pebbles that stuck 
        up in the uneven surface of the concrete, moving many times faster for 
        their size than she could ever move. The concept of killing time was a 
        new one to her despite the wastes of the children's blinking eyes. Some 
        very straggly tabby cats and tiny kitties with long hair were walking 
        around the pool. The general sense of the scene was of great bleakness 
        with very few people and only occasional appearances of these animals. 
        The soft thing looked askance through the window having no more power 
        to depart than a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed 
        or a bird half eaten. Mr. Jenkyns came up and said a few pleasant words, 
        remarking that he had to hurry off to go bathing with a friend at Parson's 
        Pleasure. There was no need for her to hurry could she get down the stairwell 
        all right alone. And meanwhile Miss Vane and Miss Vine entered a rare 
        compact of unbreakable friendship while the summer evening came on with 
        sudden darkness and a cold pelting rain like soot. The fine resilient 
        blades of grass were in marked contrast to the big, sloppy leaves. He 
        drove the punt vigorously forward. What, by the way, had she been doing 
        the previous night?</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">VII.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She 
        had her image&#150;the world sleeping like a great top on its everlasting 
        spindle&#150; and anything added to that would be mere verse making. It 
        was wonderful to stand so above the world, with a sea of sound below and 
        an ocean of air above, all mankind shrunk to the proportion of an ant 
        heap. Listen Mr Pomfret, I don't think I shall ever marry anybody. We 
        have been very good friends. Can't we? Mr. Pomfret greeted this fine old 
        bromide with a dreary snort. Incidentally, I established for a certainty, 
        what I was sure of in my own mind from the start, that there was not a 
        woman in this Common Room, married or single, who would be ready to place 
        personal loyalties above professional honor. The communications had been 
        prepared elsewhere and deliberately planted&#150;in fact there were not 
        enough letters left in the box to finish the message that had been begun 
        to Miss Vane. A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you, ma'am. Devil 
        daddy, was his answer. Instead of a nice, quiet throttling, there was 
        a nasty fall, and a lot of blood, some of which, no doubt, got on the 
        assailant's hand and dress. Should she have wanted jewels she would have 
        singled out the bicycle thief getting into a car with his casket of flashing 
        rubies as big as his nose and mouth holes. I believe that X misreading 
        'H.D. Vane' as 'H.D. Vine' put the note in the wrong gown. She searched 
        in long corridors of wintry streams for the folded white until she, panning 
        for gold in the summer morning of deeply limned blue and all the spaces 
        between the pine needles shimmering black, catapulted down Horseshoe Falls. 
        It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckle but the honeysuckle embracing 
        the thorn. She murmured that the children must be a great comfort. Long 
        ago she first came upon the scene by the river and the joy of the first 
        picnic but now only the debris of some half forgotten carnival flashed 
        like lily pads in the deadened light. The Warden, seated in a deep chair 
        near the fireplace, sunk into his winter reveries. Primly settling his 
        white bands on his black sleeve, he went upon his walk unheeded, and no 
        hand plucked his velvet sleeve.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Though 
        not to mention the leisurely pace of the story when his face was so in 
        need of a wash cloth was to violate all expectations. Nobody but I ever 
        did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself. 
        She did not want to concentrate on the diverse rocks in the clearing water 
        save the square bent head of her companion should stare in tandem with 
        her own. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and as we foundered on through 
        the heaps of white stuff I reproached myself with my absence of a pilgrim's 
        staff. She with distilled sleep seeping from a painted eye stopper murmured 
        snow and hills mingling in bitter affecting suffocating wind and snow. 
        To know no depiction but the tender north and even then to lose one's 
        way with unguent speed. The soft thing looked askance through the window 
        and the dismal spiritual atmosphere over came and more than neutralized 
        the growing physical comfort where she ensconced her bruised body. Although 
        she continued to tell her story stealthily, dogs, not cats, crowded the 
        stanza of much maladroit and hope. In an arch under the dresser reposed 
        a huge liver coloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing 
        puppies, and other dogs haunted other recesses. I shall be as dirty as 
        I please; and I like to be dirty and I will be dirty. A person from Gimmerton 
        entered the by now predictable drawing room of eternal witness. That it 
        was by some standards to be entirely expected and largely overdrawn hardly 
        mattered, for it could never be as believable as the sutured recompense 
        of her own wastrel desire. He swung the key purposely in his hand, much 
        like Biter out for his evening walk will grab at his leash. She could 
        not have refused anymore save she put out the fire in her own mineral 
        eyes. Even so, fine grains of soot scooted out from the huge fireplace, 
        blanketing hearth and floor with the granular black stuff. The kitchen 
        was forced to retreat altogether into another quarter; at least I distinguished 
        a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within; 
        and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking about the huge 
        fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the 
        walls. </font></p>

        but I ever did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash 
        himself. If you wash your face and brush your hair; it will be all right, 
        but you are so dirty. I shall be as dirty as I please; and I like to be 
        dirty and I will be dirty. They had been invited to spend the morrow and 
        the invitation had been accepted on one condition: she begged her darlings 
        might be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy. Though not 
        to mention his cloth which has seen three months' service in mire and 
        dirt and his thick uncombed hair. The surface of his face and hands were 
        dismally beclouded. Happily, after the sudden fury, she found the relief 
        of bad language. The soft thing looked askance through the window, having 
        as much power to depart as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse 
        half killed or a bird half eaten. Some very straggly tabby cats, long 
        haired, were walking around the pool. I shall not stand to be laughed 
        at. I shall not have it. A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you, ma'am. 
        By now the perfume bottles on the table had taken on the magnificence 
        of amber urns adorned with exotic animals grazing their cracked glazed 
        surfaces. Antelopes and gazelles swilled in the chill evening air. At 
        the counter all was for sale, but in the other recesses, where the tongues 
        clattered, she sought to lie down with the liver colored pointer bitch 
        and its swarming whelps. She felt herself to take on all the perfection 
        and pricelessness of a rare bottle of perfume, immured in her body as 
        darkly as angel wings rapidly flitting over a dawning earth. Having leveled 
        my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity 
        in giving me that for a home. I gazed long at the weather worn block, 
        and stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail 
        shells and pebbles, which we were very fond of storing there with more 
        perishable things. As fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early 
        playmate seated on the withered turf, his dark, square head bent forward 
        and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;A person 
        from Gimmerton walked into the room, no more than any other person at 
        that sudden time and place. In the deep recesses of the gibberish alcove 
        did the speech of the living break into rank. He was the kind of man one 
        might find around Hollywood, tall, blond, easy good looks, blackened eyes, 
        vampire or ghoul. She felt herself to take on all the preciousness of 
        a rare bottle of perfume, unguent blue and unstoppered graciousness. She 
        murmured in richly jeweled tones as the liquored sleep escaped upwards 
        from the corners of her gusting eyes. The gazelle and the giraffe loping 
        peaceably while the antelope nibbled greens in the air vent of the altar. 
        To step into the arena with the living and never with the dead. She could 
        hardly have predicted her fall, so fatefully had she wheeled her bike 
        up the small abutment and onto the hardened path, where a few scraggly 
        weeds bruised her head. Instead of a nice quiet throttling, there was 
        a nasty collision and a lot of blood, some of which no doubt got on the 
        assailant's hands and dress. Rubies as big as his nose and mouth holes. 
        A small amount of excrement beclouded the water where she kneeled fully 
        clothed in her communion dress, little wisps of lace trailing in the downward 
        spiral of the drain. Should anyone have seen her thus she would have died 
        a thousand deaths but still she labored on with steadfast good will. I 
        shall not stand to be laughed at. I shall not have it. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, 
        I cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view. Those 
        deep black eyes! That smile and ghastly paleness. Disturbed her? No! she 
        has disturbed me, night and day through eighteen years&#150;incessantly&#150;remorselessly 
        till yesternight I was tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep 
        by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers. 
        It is a poor conclusion, is it not? An absurd termination to my violent 
        exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train 
        myself to be capable of working like Hercules and when everything is ready, 
        and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanquished.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">XI.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She 
        gave the impression of being in a state of passive boredom, putting up 
        with a person she knew she was supposed to be but whom she forgot about 
        at the slightest prevarication. She uttered her own name with anger: Lol 
        Stein. She always referred to herself by her full name, as if trying out 
        this encumberance to her tongue. It was as though she had come there for 
        the specific purpose of looking for or discovering something a house, 
        a garden, a street, some object, something she could find only at night. 
        When I spoke for the first time of the love between Anne Marie Stretter, 
        the French ambassador&#8217;s wife in Lahore, and the Vice Consul, I felt like 
        I had destroyed the book, and removed it from its expectation. By its 
        absence this word ruins all the others, it contaminates them, it is also 
        the dead dog on the beach at high noon, this hole of flesh. It was here 
        on the same spot, that a girl from South Tahla began to adorn herself 
        several months before the Town Beach ball draping dresses over her body, 
        lacquering on make up. The clock like precision came next and the enormity 
        removed all doubt, whereby Lol was ending the days when her heart was 
        not yet touched completely. On the third floor of the Forest Hotel, a 
        light goes on in one of the windows. I, in turn, tell her about what happened 
        two nights before in my room, a sudden guttering of time and possessions. 
        I had studied my room closely, moving various objects around, as though 
        surreptitiously, making way for the vision she would give them, making 
        way for her place among them: Lol moving among the unmoving objects. I 
        pictured things being moved about into so many different positions that 
        I became upset, then joyous. It was as though some sort of thickness, 
        some ineptitude, came and lodged in my hands, because of my inability 
        to decide what the exact position of these objects should be in relation 
        to her life. I gave up the grave, gave up trying to fit her, alive, into 
        the death of things.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">XII</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;They 
        began to move, to walk toward the walls, searching for imaginary doors. 
        The half light of dawn was the same indoors and out. At last they found 
        the way to the real door and began to move slowly forward, light crashing 
        over their foreheads and splintering their irises. Since our previous 
        assignation at the Forest Hotel, she has not spoken of Cat Street nor 
        of the shadows that swallowed them up. A momentary indecision or was it 
        her face in perpetual profile. The caterwauling of the dawn just before 
        I want to see Town Beach with you again. I listen to her memory beginning 
        to function, to take hold of the shapes which she juxtaposes, one beside 
        the other like some game, the rules which have been lost. Sleep sweeping 
        her nights in the unstoppered stoppering of the children's jeweled eyes. 
        Unguent blue and angel wings flitting over a darkened earth. Her eyes 
        are like velvet, the way only dark eyes can be, hers now, a mixture of 
        still water and silt, revealing nothing at present except a kind of drowsy 
        intellection. But tonight she is wearing make up, which is a little too 
        heavy, it seems to me, and carelessly intuited. Immersed in her body, 
        still asking where this body ought to be, where exactly to put it. In 
        the soft thud of sand bags, they had watched the violinists file past, 
        knowing no depiction but the tender north and even then to lose one's 
        way in the declining horizon. The Town Beach casino, how well I know it, 
        the ancient forests of her eyes giving way to eternal piece. Now searching 
        for the door, they realize they had entered Annie, looking strange without 
        her cap and gown. The bicycle thief and the crash onto concrete hurtled 
        against the abutment of an embankment that stopped up this dead end street. 
        A gaudy hotel with its cases of jewels poorly protected in safes easily 
        tripped by her excessively lightsome eyes. Rubies as big as his mouth 
        and nose holes. The gray shape is in the field of rye, the rye shape is 
        in the field of grain. I remain at the window for a long time. She does 
        not move. I have the feeling she is fast asleep. I refuse to admit the 
        end which is probably going to come and separate us, how easy it will 
        be, how distressingly simple, for the moment I refuse to accept it, to 
        accept this end, I accept the other, the end which has still to be invented, 
        the endless end, the endless beginning of Lol.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;She, 
        who does not see herself, is thus seen in others. She is erecting a scaffolding 
        which, it would appear, is temporarily necessary for her, a woods, a field 
        of wheat, a patience. This trip, in the future, will be like the town 
        of South Tahla is for her now, lying in ruins beneath her footsteps of 
        the present. The train descends into the sea with a mighty roar and an 
        explosion of metal dramaturgy, pince nez shattering in blinding ocean 
        spray. Town seems remarkably empty and uninteresting, a safe haven or 
        dangerous beach, but for the children at their games. The yellow square 
        rectangle of grass confirmed very little except its persistence in her 
        triangle of snow, suffocating, affecting, translucent, white. If only 
        she could perish at the thought of her sudden right. Folding into themselves 
        and the folded white. A person from Gimmerton in the now predictable drawing 
        room of eternal witness stepped forward, as the speech of the living broke 
        into rank. What is your opinion of our friend, Jack Hold? Devil daddy, 
        was his answer. I danced with the woman from Uxbridge, danced well in 
        fact, and I talked with her, I committed that crime as well, and I was 
        relieved to commit it. The minute I saw her in her gray coat, in her South 
        Tahla costume, she was the woman in the rye field behind the Forest Hotel. 
        The woman who is not. And the woman who is here beside me. In the center 
        of Town Beach, as white as milk, an enormous bird, poised for flight, 
        its two equal wings trimmed with balustrades, its overhanging terrace, 
        its green cupolas, its green shutters lowered against the summer sun, 
        its rodomontades, its flowers, its angels, its garlands, its gold, its 
        milk whiteness, as white as snow, as sugar: the municipal casino. She 
        freezes because of something going on inside her, what? unknown, savage 
        leitmotifs, swilling rose petals, cracked newspaper glass. The heat of 
        summer which till that day she had listlessly endured explodes and spreads. 
        She is submerged in it. Everything is: the street, the town, this stranger. 
        What heat and what is this weariness? She examines everything. Not only 
        the posters announcing coming events, the gala evenings and the concerts, 
        but the display windows full of glittering jewelry, tufted dresses, and 
        exuding perfumes as well.</font></p>

      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Detached 
        sentences of unfamiliar potency filled her notebook of irreplaceable space, 
        covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Riffs of blackness 
        overcoming night. Other parts scrawled in a childish hand inclined their 
        spaced out printing to several pages laced together like sewing cards 
        through holes of impenetrable absence. Coming upon a particularly beautiful 
        place of washed out ditches, she would think that if she had been dead 
        a long time and had suddenly come to life, how grateful she would be for 
        her old life and the joy of the first picnic now diminished in dully reflecting 
        lily pads. If only there could be some leakage to this incredibly beautiful 
        day that went on in the full awareness of its misgivings beyond her glassed 
        in passage way. The Warden deep in his winter chair twilled his pen in 
        the waning firelight. One is under the bathroom sink where you put the 
        stove. Another is in the rodomontade. Night was falling when I reached 
        the Forest Hotel. The hotel is the last number on Forest Boulevard. A 
        row of ancient alders leads up to the hotel, a few missing like the teeth 
        on a child's plastic comb. On the third floor of the Forest Hotel, a light 
        goes on in one of the windows. Her head is knocked backed in surprise, 
        as she looks up, surveying the field from this third story flight. It 
        fastens upon her eyes which, from a distance, are laughing as they come 
        forward to meet me, the mineral light in them gleams bright and clear. 
        We cannot even imagine how many axes there are in these stories. Love 
        and the axe are inseparable. She sought floor joyces of constant rupture 
        wedding her body of extreme tendentiousness. His nose and mouth holes 
        as big as rubies. The odor of the fields drifts through the window. Lol 
        dreams of another time, when the same thing that is going to happen would 
        happen differently. In another way. A thousand times. Everywhere. Elsewhere, 
        among others, thousands of others, who, like ourselves dream of this time, 
        necessarily. This dream contaminates me, pursues me, through alterable, 
        unalterable way stations of unguent speed.</font></p>
