      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A comic 
        version of love and nausea. Sydney, an abstract-novelist-dyke is living 
        on Wanda?s sex work earnings. Wanda has a bad case of stripper?s disgust. 
        They quarrel and hurtle apart, through urban undergrowth, each bolted 
        to a separate flaw in the social texture. There's a multiple personality 
        somewhere, a baby, and a theater?plus a Romanian refugee who has been 
        boiled in history. In this urban jungle, anyone you meet can flash a sentence 
        and reel across the stage, and the sadist is melancholy, the effect of 
        too much sex, power, torture, and poetry. </font></p>

        The scenes switch back and forth from 'park' to 'office'. We used white 
        rectangular pedestals; on one side of the bench there was office stuff 
        arranged on the pedestals, on the other were arranged several flower pots 
        with plastic flowers stuck in their dirt. The office included a typewriter 
        on a typing table, which was swung out in front of the bench for the office 
        scenes. Scene switches were indicated by lighting changes, which highlighted 
        one set of pedestals or the other. The 'park' half of the stage could 
        also be indicated by a few crepe paper flowers scattered around, big as 
        heads. Every now &amp; then someone would give one of the flowers a good 
        kick.</font></p>
