Assorted strange cars are in view through its window; I stare         at them, grind coffee, work a whole bean between my lips. The top shelf         of our icebox is filled with various containers of milk: bottles, jugs,         jars. Each is inventively painted: one is a robin&#39;s egg blue, another         is striped, another is decorated with sea, sun, palm and coconut trees;         tropical sorts of pictures. I remove this container, wait for the coffee,         flip through a magazine, feel my armpits grow moist. My elbows and feet,         in contrast, look and feel rough, dry, even to the point of scaly.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I open the         magazine to an item that announces itself with a photograph of a woman         wearing mountain climbing gear standing in front of an incline she plans         to scale. <i>&quot;What She Needs To Get To The Top</i>,&quot; reads the         headline; does this athlete/model, I wonder, ever wake up to a dirty kitchen?         I read the article, its pieces of advice on how to all-at-once: achieve         financial success, spend rugged outdoor time, keep your body hydrated,         your skin smooth, youthful, moist. When I lived in the tropics my skin         appeared smooth, youthful, moist; since moving to this dry place I constantly         apply heavy creams to my hands, thighs, lips. Without a routine total-body-drench         my skin would turn rough, dull, dead --at least that is a condition I         dread and can all too easily picture. I skim the article, make note of         their tips on financial success and skin care, especially protective outdoor         beauty creams and their different portable containers: high-tech tubes         and compacts, purse and pocket-size jars.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This magazine         article suits my mood for friendly entertainment, nothing fierce, nothing         intense to unsettle or jar. Skin care is my line of work so that information         attracts me, and chances are I may never reach financial success, or get         to the point of even <i>dressing</i> in mountain climbing gear, let alone         of standing at an incline I plan to scale. Still it is something pleasant         to dream about, pleasant to picture.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> I grow         agitated sitting here now, though normally I enjoy our kitchen. Normally         I love spending time here, concocting beauty products, baking; pies are         my favorite, especially pinching crusts decoratively at the pie pan lip.         I&#39;m good with crusts, my beauty product distributor&#8212;snoring somewhere         in our house&#8212;is good with fillings, getting them to be just the right         consistency, not runny, not dry but appetizingly moist.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Actually,         I am beyond agitated sitting here now, hanging around in these cluttered,         crowded conditions; I hate these conditions; hatred makes my eyes moist.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">True, I         wanted the party, but I did not expect it to go so late, to grow so disorderly;         waking up to a dirty and jammed house is no fun, it is an event that unsettles,         that jars. I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror and immediately         smooth out my furrowed brow, and frowning lips. Not that I am anti-facial-lines;         my products are not designed to make consumers look younger than their         age, just perhaps healthier than what is considered normal to their age         scale. My product distributor expects to sit down with me and sample new         skin enhancers today, in this very kitchen. But in this mess I am conceptually         barren, unable to think, work, put anything together let alone a solid,         new product picture.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When it         comes to body flaws my beauty product distributor exaggerates his features         into an ugly and extreme picture. Once a month, or so, he calls me up,         lists his imperfections, magnifies them, thanks me for developing the         milky hydrating mask which transforms&#8212;at least temporarily&#8212;the most         damaged skin into an organ that is smooth supple, moist. Of all the cars         parked in our driveway his is the sportiest and cleanest, though his glove         box contains more food than we have in our entire kitchen. You can count         on: packets of crackers, tins of tuna, a cocktail olive jar. And his constant         companion, the food scale. This is his glove box (it is a super-sized         glove box); his trunk holds samples of the newest addition to my beauty         line: simple cosmetics to brush on the eyes, to dab on cheeks and lips.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is         no solid reason for my agitation or perspiration; guests will wake up,         help clean, thank me for the party, kiss me with freshly glossed lips.         The party was a gas, this morning feels grim but the day will get better,         I should (but am too slow-moving to) vacuum floors, scrub toilets, empty         the dish sink; I should re-hang all the fallen pictures. To divert my         mind from this big mess and my personal laziness I think of endearing         guest traits: my distributor, for example, religiously weighs his food         portions but never himself&#8212;he is vehemently anti-body weight scales. He         is a genius at distributing my home remedies that keep your skin nourished,         clean, but most of all moist. He and I share devotion to hydration for         skin and body&#8212;last night he brought each party guest a gift of his newly         patented <i>Dual Hydrator</i>, that is, a portable water container whose         top unscrews to a compact-sized moisturizer holder, and whose bottom is         a 6 ounce, shatterproof drinking jar. We both believe in this contraption,         capable of preventing skin and body dehydration simultaneously; he believes         (I am personally unsure) that drinking from a wide mouth container is         healthier than pursing your lips around a bottle or straw; when he visits,         we make sure to have neither in our kitchen.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By evening         everything scales back to order: the kitchen is clean, guests&#8212;thankful         for their party gifts: <i>Dual Hydrator</i> jars, and moistening lip/cheek         gloss&#8212;have gone home, my distributor and I get down to business: he applies         my newest deep-cleansing mask, I document with a series of instructional         pictures.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><a name="oce"></a><font size="4">Scout</font></b></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OCEAN ROOM</b></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Guests arrive         this evening; I start off my day with Scout in the Ocean Room, programming         our morning experience. Yesterday we released synthetic sharks and turned         on heavy currents and weather (wind, hail, thunder), which made for an         invigorating, at times frightening, morning. Today, in the mood for something         calmer, we set a light wave/light breeze program, and discharge imitation         sea creatures, designed to brush against users with gentle pressure: no         biting, no rough rubbing, no insertion. I position myself strapped (with         easy to close and unfasten Velcro) to a plank, where I do leg, arm and         abdominal stretching exercises; Scout sits high up on our craggy Styrofoam         cliff. He&#39;s relieved to have this wide view; yesterday he was underwater,         just at my hip, forced to focus on that specific body segment.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         biggest problem with this Ocean Room is the window that looks onto our         garden. I had envisioned a small porthole, high up, to view sky, clouds,         and weather. But that wasn&#39;t communicated to our construction crews, who         put in a window that turns out to be a towering, floor to ceiling rectangle.         I don&#39;t ALWAYS want to view our garden; guests don&#39;t either. We provide         plenty of vegetation on our Ocean Room&#8212;s floor, but more importantly,         that outside garden butts into Ocean Room concentration. So I asked our         crew to design multi-sliding panels of tinted glass; users can choose         which blocks of outside they want to view, and which they want to blot         out. I did not ask them to seal the bottom towering rectangular window         portion, because I worried sealing up the opening might bring bad luck.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Scout is         adaptable: his slanted bottom is buoyant when he wants to float; mobile         when he propels across water, or scales our assorted Styrofoam structures.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Last year         this room revolved around pirate scenery and accessories. It contained         a large mound of land with hammocks, treasure chests, assorted tropical         trees, and wrecked-ship fragments.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Anchored         in our ocean were sailing ships rigged with telescopes, stocked with bins         of salty food and water. Staff and guests dressed pirate-like (the eye         patch, the cropped trousers, the bandanna, the rum bottles) and behaved         like pirates, but not cruel, toothless or scurveyed ones.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Now, those         supplies are in storage. Our latest plan is a fairy tale type complex         of seaside castles. Pink, we think, with red flags, long hair spilling         out of windows, unicorns prancing along beaches, and Scout stationed on         the drawbridge, in the turrets.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Unstrapping         my straps, I move from the plank to the water slide, which loops, twists,         loops down to a wide bottom. I slide down, lie on my stomach and do weighted         leg lifts; did I mention the exercise equipment in this Ocean Room? Weights         disguised as coral, seashells, and rocks. Scout not only views, he assists:         explains which buttons activate which sea creatures, and which regulate         water temperature, weather and plank settings. He even helps users physically         train.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some guests         even appreciate his help on one of our most private features: the option         of pressing one button that activates a smooth pipe, positioning it between         users legs&#8212;each individual manually determine its depth of actual penetration&#8212;and         emits a spurt of fluid. Many guests love this; I agree it is a pleasure,         but because it performs a physical function I have met in other places--which         is not the case with some of my guests&#8212;I rarely choose it.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Lighting         can also be programmed: sun, clouds, total darkness, or starry constellations.         This morning I choose dimness.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Although         the space is enclosed and filled with water, there is nothing womb like         about it. Ocean Room is spacious and unconfining.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Water         is lubricant, but too long inside shrivels the skin. We call this our         Ocean Room; true, it smells salty. But the water is fresh, and filled         with oils, which seal in, don&#39;t take out, skin moisture. Bottles and jars         of skin moisturizers await users once they step out of &quot;Ocean&quot;.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another         reason I don&#39;t want to be reminded of our garden from this Ocean Room         is the complexity. Not only of living matter (soil, petals, snakes) but         also of colors and smells. Garden smells are so many and so various. They         truly distract, for example by conflicting with the saline smell we&#39;ve         so carefully wafted into the ocean room. Some days Scout leaves with users.         Today he rests. I dry off, moisturize, dress and walk across the hall,         up a set of stairs, and get into another robe for my visit with Mack,         Mack focusing on specific mind/body treatments.&#9;</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>TREATMENTS</b></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I sometimes         call Mack, &quot;our salon,&quot; the term doesn&#39;t do him justice; he         performs so many and such versatile functions. Hair, nail and skin beauty         treatments, but he also gives good advice, and performs excellent detoxification.         My guests and I can eat, drink, inhale anything and keep clean, thanks         to exercise, food, and regular Mack detoxifications. I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re         unhealthy, or overly imbibe in toxins, yet who knows what lurks in our         soil and air, especially around this complex and its buildings, continually         undergoing construction and re-construction.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Today         I undergo my detoxification, then opt for a weather dose; Mack simulates         various outdoor elements. He can envelop you in a hot summer, or crisp         fall, evening. Today I select an afternoon of steely Nordic winter, which         requires slipping on an insulated body stocking since the temperature         dips well below freezing. My eyebrows turn to ice, as does a bit of saliva         around my lips, but the cold climate does give my skin a fresh color.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Yesterday         my weather simulation was a dewy spring rain.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Mack         is a gifted acupuncturist; he has helped more than one guest break a smoking         habit, heal an arthritic condition, turn vegetarian. We sometimes call         Mack &quot;Doc.&quot; He tailors all routines to individuals. When I get         a massage, for example, Mack pays special attention to my long, often         chilly, fingers, so good at forming pie crust dough. And he gives rides;         you can get sensations of altitude&#8212;rocketing up high&#8212;and depth&#8212;plummeting         down low; once I spent an entire late morning as if I were crewing a lightning         fast submarine.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;This         late morning I don&#39;t choose a ride. Mack performs a special eye hydration         procedure, curls my eyelashes, gives me a long overdue total body wax,         and successfully medicates a lingering yeast infection, made worse, no         doubt, by an overlong afternoon spent gardening in a wet bathing suit         after a session in the Ocean Room.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Mack         is exceedingly popular. During our busy seasons&#8212;no matter how carefully         our expert staff schedules--groups of guests are going to find themselves         waiting. So, waiting became just another part of our Mack experience.         We put together a pleasant, even stimulating, waiting room: coffee and         juice bar; deep velvet chairs; hypoallergenic rugs and fake fur pelts         for those who prefer floor lounging. Shelves of books, periodicals, board         games; hollow seashells to listen, or blow in to. In winters, an electric         fire which radiates warmth.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;At first,         I did not want that fire. Too reminiscent of dangerous animals, stifling         tents, dehydrated meals. Not to mention the flammability of drifting ashes.         But my staff convinced me that my fears were dramatic. Given that no actual         burning goes on.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Users         leave Mack with an immense sense of well being, I&#39;m no exception.

We call it mean sex, but in fact things never leave the         realm of rough play. To reach the site you must walk across a field, over         a bridge, pass through thickets of thorns and briars to another bridge         that crosses a moat that leads into a Styrofoam&#8212;made to look like stone&#8212;fortress.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the front         hall is a costume and prop room: capes, gowns, and diapers.

Imitation candles with realistic looking flames; these reach         and flicker over buttocks, bellies, under throats, without causing burning         or blistering. House rules: no videotaping.

I haven&#39;t         been comfortable here since a goof I made during my last interactive visit,         several months ago now. I was training a new staff member; we simultaneously         punctured pouches of red dye located above each of our right ears; I&#8212;velcroed         to the wall&#8212;watched the dye drip down over her (phenomenally high) cheekbone,         when I became distracted by her surprise for me: a very small dentist         whose dental kit overflowed with astonishing objects. Her creativity made         me ashamed of my conventional, out of date surprise&#8212;simple leash and studded         collar.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But I cannot         wallow in that mistake; I&#39;m here to investigate Potty Room, a station         used by a few regulars who orchestrate their play around going to the         bathroom: forcing one another to go; not allowing one another to go, allowing         one another to go, but only in specific ways and places. It is very easy         to make Potty Room look clean, but I have to test bacteria levels before         I&#39;m satisfied it&#39;s sterile.

It hasn&#39;t really landed from outer space;         it is a prop of our UFO abduction.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>UFO ABDUCTION</b></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While UFO         Abduction is in an entirely separate structure from our Mean Sex unit,         I mentally connect the two. Because of their body-machinery combination,         and their hints of degradation. No other portion of our complex, except         maybe meals, is so geared toward individual needs. We give guests personal         UFO fantasy experiences. Some require staff to dress up and behave like         monstrous aliens, bent on physically and mentally probing, perhaps also         on taking some vital human idea, body part or fluid. But just as many         users request staff to enact what they imagine are gentle, non-probing         aliens, curious but not dangerous; sniffing, maybe even licking the way         a young puppy or bear cub might. Another harmless alien-type our staff         enacts is the friendly ghost kind: calming, nebulous, marshmallow-like         forms, rubbery or cottony to touch. Most guests pick desert or wood location.         Our abductions take place exclusively at night; we use strobes to fill         the sky with luminous, riotous color; or swarming insect shapes. Sometimes         the sky is simple pitch black. Guests can also experience being in-ship.         In an actual ship. Some ships are spanking clean, others have an appearance         of being dirty; we smudge floors and walls with pudding and jelly-like         goo, fill them with bad odors (material from our foul smelling mushroom         compost). But the outsides of ships are pristine and symmetrical.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;I now         head over to Camp, where we have other ships, to check on the snake situation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>DESERT         CAMP</b></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In our various         kinds of camp, specially trained staff guides guests over rocky terrain,         through deep, dense forests, on wide-open seas. We also have special hunting         and fishing trips where guests learn to spear, skin, gut, scale and cook         their catch. Today, responding to a request for authentic, as opposed         to robotic, rattlesnakes (for culinary reasons, which I&#39;ll soon explain),         I duck my head into &quot;Desert&quot; where guests learn how to hike         a trail, protect themselves from dangerous creatures, and find edible         food. Snakes have become a growing desert focus. At this point, desert         doesn&#39;t have any natural poisonous snakes, only natural non-poisonous,         and imitation poisonous ones. Our snake education overviews: the importance         of correct footwear: leather boots, heavy soles, thick socks. How to determine         if they are poisonous; how to suck out venom, if bit (guests with canker         sores, cold sores, or gum scrapes from hard food or dental work get a         protective mouth liner). We teach participants to look where to step,         or, when it comes to steep, rocky trails that require hand and foot action,         what to look for before placing down unprotected fingers or palms. Because         one of our chefs loves our &quot;desert&quot; so much, we&#39;ve been able         to integrate cooking into Camp.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Her basic         and gourmet rattlesnake recipes have guests requesting authentic rattlesnakes;         guests wanting the experience of killing and cooking the poisonous reptile.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I&#39;ve tasted,         and cooked both recipes, and will repeat them here: kill the snake (cut         off its head, then skin it&#8212;carefully avoiding the poisonous fangs, and         slice meat into strips). For the basic recipe, coat the strip in beaten         egg and corn flakes, and pan fry. For the gourmet recipe, marinate the         meat (lemon, basil, garlic and olive oil) before grilling over mesquite         chips. I understand the appeal of genuine rattlers, but the danger factor         leaves me undecided.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Camp         also offers fitness and beauty on the trail. Hiking, with frequent stops         for spot reducing; weights, disguised as rocks (clearly labeled 3 lbs.,         5, 8, 12, 15) are used for lunges, squats, military presses. A cliff with         pegs and ropes for mountain scaling. Aloe, and other plant juices are         excellent for skin care. Running feet through sand and gravel rubs away         corns and calluses caused by hiking. Make up can be found in any of the         berry-covered bushes; our berries redden cheeks and lips for hours.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This area         is desert-like, yet we do take liberties with authenticity. For example,         the big pond we put in, which we stocked with fish. I love visiting desert,         knowing I can enjoy the feel of the blistering sun on my face and neck         since these desert rays are artificial, 100 percent safe, incapable of         causing any real skin damage.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO</b>:         Lynn Crawford lives outside of Detroit with her husband and two sons.         Her work has appeared in various anthologies including most recently <i>Fetish         Fiction</i> (Four Walls Eight Windows) and <i>The Oulipo Compendium</i>         (Atlas Press).
