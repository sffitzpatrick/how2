      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Why is the 
        measure of love loss? This inquiry, which begins Jeanette Winterson&#8217;s 
        <i>Written on the Body</i>, is perhaps what I had in mind when I began 
        to miss the flesh that became <i>Eggflower</i>. My longing, long under 
        my skin, surfaced in words, a meditation on love and loss, one that I 
        locked myself in for days. I write like that a lot. Days where only my 
        body tells me it is time to eat/sleep/bathe. It is fortunate that my life 
        allows me this, as a line a day would be too painful, especially where 
        <i>Eggflower</i> is concerned. What is unique about my process for this 
        poem is that I did not open up a Word program to construct it, but instead, 
        began a series of e-mails I knew would not be received. This form became 
        the emotional consent and space I needed to interpret my passion for this 
        person whose distance caused such raw introspection. As I struggled with 
        a language to transcribe my experience, I discovered the abstract relationship 
        between the words and what I was feeling. The frustration and pain was 
        tremendously generative, and I know this union is entirely nothing new; 
        however, the sentences I managed to construct were original and startling 
        to me and the gendered, safe-history of the love I&#8217;d known. The experience 
        of writing &quot;Eggflower, Land,&quot; or knowing what it was to write 
        it, has changed my writing immensely. This is a new language for me. The 
        vital emotional and formal deconstruction of an unanswered and perhaps 
        impossible love, <i>Eggflower</i> was written so that I can keep writing 
        or feeling. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Eggflower, 
        Land</b></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#8212;don&#8217;t look&#8212;the 
        blond shell is not dropping. Is not incoming. Downtown, everything is 
        more of the same. The jacarandas do not bloom in December. Fourth Street 
        runs one way. The stop signs do not know if the fast red cars will stop. 
        Sirens no longer inspire sentences ending in question marks. A man on 
        the corner needs only socks. The cold weather shelter is full. My house, 
        like Eggflower's, is empty.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eggflower, 
        are you not coming home soon? The heart has yoked its hour. The planes 
        are waiting. They talk on radios and circle the moon, holiday blue and 
        slightly sour. And from my roof I can watch them fine. They line up and 
        promise return. Could one hold you? Perhaps. They remind me of your distance&#8212;like 
        a photograph, radio words are not better than breath. Heavy planes wait 
        for a signal to land, are patient with the sky &amp; sand, unlike Eggflower 
        who stays away from her little house by the sea. Wood and paint, moonfull 
        of flowers, red rocks &amp; photographs wait to keep her from distance. 
        </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In proximity, 
        I am a brown tree without green leaves. A blind street full of potholes 
        &amp; fables somewhere between Eggflower's words, her sky and wood, paint 
        and photographs. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The holiday 
        is almost over.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From the 
        roof I know my window will frame many returns. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Still, like 
        lights that line the dark runway, a little blue tree waits for you. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">II.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eggflower, 
        I&#8217;ve come down from the roof and blue is still in fashion; the year is 
        new. I&#8217;ve lost my keys, calendar &amp; compass&#8212;the photo of you by the 
        pool. I&#8217;ve strung your postcards across my living room. A biographer&#8217;s 
        clothesline. I stare at them and turn your name over and over in my mouth.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>A ferry 
        crossing the Mekong River with no image to last the way across</i>&#8212;I am 
        rereading Duras, again. One Sunday morning her language found your breath 
        and began my day. Now, it is difficult to get out of bed. My two feet 
        on cold hardwood, walls full of books, and I am lost.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">III. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In search 
        of. This coast cartographer left her cats alone with a screen projecting 
        mice, lizards and fish. People have narrated stories of my pacing the 
        Pacific Coast Highway. They say that I am talking to myself, but I am 
        mapping places we found and found again, recollecting and repeating our 
        conversations aloud when I reach their places of origin&#8212;bars, gas stations, 
        motels and sea cliffs. Perhaps it is irrational to reinvent the art of 
        mapmaking for loss, but I yearn for the familiar. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Soon I will 
        return, empty papyrus and head full of memory, to hold one of your postcards. 
        To touch black lines, ink raised on cardstock, a stamp you took from my 
        desk drawer. Your autograph&#8212;<i>Eggflower</i>, stranded. My only knowledge: 
        you flew to the Northwest and sent a postcard from the East. It reads: 
        </font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>these 
            storms. inside and out. this ring of yours still on my finger. this 
            heart beaten. words between us float; open your mouth</i>. </font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My mouth. 
        I have spoken then written the word <i>drought</i> on a million different 
        bottles&#8212;blue, yellow, blue, green, blue, mostly blue. I sent them all 
        to the North Atlantic via the South Pacific&#8212;an impossible route. Still, 
        I check my shore every day for simple signs of your brands: scotch, cigarettes, 
        magazines and bath products.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IV.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yesterday 
        I stuffed eight dollars into a metal box that let me sit in a designated 
        space for eight hours. The space was black outlined by white. The space 
        is in a parking lot next to my address and in your flight path. The money 
        was too much for the narrow slit. The instructions, words and illustrations, 
        were not helpful&#8212;or, I had no patience for them. It is getting difficult 
        to discriminate. The crumpled bill took a long time to make fit. Finally, 
        my skin spread white on asphalt. I looked very small in the space, not 
        a car at all. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The day 
        before yesterday I drove east till the moon lifted off my hood and the 
        sun sank in my rear view mirror simultaneously. My vehicle moved between 
        the dark thighs of mountains and all around me were sights that proved 
        to me you were once here: your songs in my system, maps on my dash, blonde 
        hair on the passenger headrest. I took your mug from the floor mat and 
        traced your fossilized lips with my empty ring finger then swerved to 
        miss a falling star.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Two days 
        before yesterday I parked my car at the airport and took a yellow cab 
        back to my apartment where I watched television, all day. On &quot;Book 
        TV&quot; a male poet spent an hour and four minutes introducing a haiku 
        that lasted seconds. He spoke of scientists who find metaphors like money 
        in the street, the paradigm of webs, and men who write poems about themselves 
        after dreams of flying, rotten teeth, and foreign places. I sat on the 
        rug you brought me from Thailand and shook. It had been thundering and 
        I&#8217;d just finished soundproofing my heart. Body sweaty with an interpretation 
        of television and lightning, it was the beginning or end of a blue illness 
        diagnosed by pages of post holiday writing. Words reconstructing the places 
        we&#8217;d learned each other&#8212;a ghost haunting her own life. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">V.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I have chewed 
        off my leg and packed it in Styrofoam peanuts, Candy Corn and confetti, 
        in a brown box with only a return address. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is just 
        a metaphor, the result of too much red wine, word-processing and alliteration. 
        At the keys, I bite my truths to keep from typing in tongues. Horns tell 
        me fog is heavy on the bay; my hands ache and I have grown tired of figurative 
        language. I constructed you a text without using the letter E then walked 
        to our breakfast place and consumed two plates of vegetable scramble, 
        rosemary potatoes, sausages and raisin toast. The waitress we like, the 
        one with the asymmetrical silver hair, asked where my friend was and I 
        said I didn&#8217;t know. Eggflower, are you forgetting me?</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">VI.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I am back 
        with language and planes arrive on the hour without you. For your welcome, 
        I&#8217;ve written you a fruit basket full of fresh pineapples, pears, mangos 
        and blood oranges. I will continue to rewrite the fruit as it rots. I 
        replaced pineapple with kiwi, pear with honeydew. I composed a sentence 
        that said <i>I</i> was rotting when I meant to say <i>it</i>. It is difficult 
        to keep my pronouns straight. I placed ambiguity in the basket. I may 
        very well be rotting in the first person.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is 
        why I embrace blue. Blue is to be alive, to make sentences, to unaccept. 
        In blue, your return is not as essential as your departure and prolonged 
        distance. I&#8217;ve wrapped what&#8217;s left of me in blue. My walls are blue and 
        I&#8217;ve taken to wearing my eye shadow blue. I&#8217;ve found a religion in the 
        semiotics of color, like schools, hospitals, churches, nurseries and mad 
        houses&#8212;<i>Sweetheart, come</i>. Travel by air. From my distance, I can 
        still make out your brow when you&#8217;re angry, distinguish your blue eyes, 
        sad. Eggflower, are you angry or sad? I am not forgetting you.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">VII.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I ache for 
        departure, and although they suggest I am unfit for travel, I have spent 
        the last few days flipping through catalogs of flight. Discount is everywhere. 
        Tickets are cheaper if you fly one way. If I pack my suitcase, will things 
        make sense? Or, do I ache for a new geography because your arrival requires 
        wings and a flight number I do not have. Most recent on the clothesline, 
        I cannot decode your postcard. On the other side of an unremarkable skyscraper, 
        you write: </font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>the 
            sky opens me like the slit&#8212;wide marks of a sentence. rain changing 
            meanings. memory washed. i&#8217;m thinking your name in my mouth<!--Cannot determine character contextually, see original-->
            </i></font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">These letters 
        form an abstraction&#8212;sky, slit, marks, sentence, rain, meanings, memory 
        and mouth. I&#8217;ve stenciled these words on a dirty canvas resurrected from 
        deep in my closet. It&#8217;s hung on my blue wall where the calendar used to 
        be. There is a noun for each day of the week and one for the day you return.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">VIII.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It&#8217;s raining 
        in Southern California. For three days: rain, mainly. Everyone says, &quot;It&#8217;s 
        about fucking time.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Because 
        of the rain, flight paths have changed; the planes take off over my house. 
        I cannot count the incoming. My home is unbearable. I will get in my car 
        and drive to the incoming. I will wait for you in the tiny bar near United. 
        I will order Bloody Marys in twos, pay the extras dollars for the doubles, 
        and tell the man or woman who brings them that &quot;I am waiting for 
        Eggflower to land.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IX. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">February. 
        Hearts are everywhere and everyone is buying. It&#8217;s expensive to be in 
        love. </font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I lose something 
        each time I look at the sky, the ground, and the sea. For this reason, 
        I stay in my apartment with the shades closed to keep myself whole. I 
        wear a blue slip and your only pair of matching socks; they are red. Your 
        angry brow and sad eyes, I cannot picture. Your mouth is an anomaly. Listening 
        to Holiday and Waits, I reread your postcards, the latest from a city 
        I can locate: Paris. They are in French. I look up every word in my French-English 
        dictionary. I am diligent; however, the words narrate encyclopedic persons, 
        places, and things. For this female, your distance is becoming a desperation 
        to construct meaning. What is the meaning of <i>your</i> <i>distance</i>? 
        I have filled the empty papyrus, meant for inventive mapmaking, with two 
        words: <i>your</i> and <i>distance</i>. I have eliminated the adjective 
        <i>your</i>, the possessive form of you. In my epistemology, I am left 
        with only distance: <i>the separation in space and time; the interval 
        separating any two specified instants in time, the degree of deviation 
        or difference that separates two things in a relationship; a point or 
        area that is faraway.</i></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eggflower, 
        you are becoming a beautiful word. <i>Eggflower</i>. Two words. Egg: <i>a
