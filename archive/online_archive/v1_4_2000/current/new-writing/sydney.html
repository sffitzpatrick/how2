This inquiry, which begins Jeanette Wintersons         <i>Written on the Body</i>, is perhaps what I had in mind when I began         to miss the flesh that became <i>Eggflower</i>. My longing, long under         my skin, surfaced in words, a meditation on love and loss, one that I         locked myself in for days. I write like that a lot. Days where only my         body tells me it is time to eat/sleep/bathe. It is fortunate that my life         allows me this, as a line a day would be too painful, especially where         <i>Eggflower</i> is concerned. What is unique about my process for this         poem is that I did not open up a Word program to construct it, but instead,         began a series of e-mails I knew would not be received. This form became         the emotional consent and space I needed to interpret my passion for this         person whose distance caused such raw introspection. As I struggled with         a language to transcribe my experience, I discovered the abstract relationship         between the words and what I was feeling. The frustration and pain was         tremendously generative, and I know this union is entirely nothing new;         however, the sentences I managed to construct were original and startling         to me and the gendered, safe-history of the love Id known. The experience         of writing &quot;Eggflower, Land,&quot; or knowing what it was to write         it, has changed my writing immensely. This is a new language for me. The         vital emotional and formal deconstruction of an unanswered and perhaps         impossible love, <i>Eggflower</i> was written so that I can keep writing         or feeling. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Eggflower,         Land</b></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">dont lookthe         blond shell is not dropping.

The stop signs do not know if the fast red cars will stop.         Sirens no longer inspire sentences ending in question marks. A man on         the corner needs only socks.

The heart has yoked its hour. The planes         are waiting. They talk on radios and circle the moon, holiday blue and         slightly sour. And from my roof I can watch them fine. They line up and         promise return. Could one hold you? Perhaps. They remind me of your distancelike         a photograph, radio words are not better than breath. Heavy planes wait         for a signal to land, are patient with the sky &amp; sand, unlike Eggflower         who stays away from her little house by the sea. Wood and paint, moonfull         of flowers, red rocks &amp; photographs wait to keep her from distance.         </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In proximity,         I am a brown tree without green leaves.

Perhaps it is irrational to reinvent the art of         mapmaking for loss, but I yearn for the familiar. </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Soon I will         return, empty papyrus and head full of memory, to hold one of your postcards.         To touch black lines, ink raised on cardstock, a stamp you took from my         desk drawer. Your autograph<i>Eggflower</i>, stranded. My only knowledge:         you flew to the Northwest and sent a postcard from the East.

The space was black outlined by white. The space         is in a parking lot next to my address and in your flight path. The money         was too much for the narrow slit. The instructions, words and illustrations,         were not helpfulor, I had no patience for them. It is getting difficult         to discriminate. The crumpled bill took a long time to make fit. Finally,         my skin spread white on asphalt. I looked very small in the space, not         a car at all. </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The day         before yesterday I drove east till the moon lifted off my hood and the         sun sank in my rear view mirror simultaneously. My vehicle moved between         the dark thighs of mountains and all around me were sights that proved         to me you were once here: your songs in my system, maps on my dash, blonde         hair on the passenger headrest. I took your mug from the floor mat and         traced your fossilized lips with my empty ring finger then swerved to         miss a falling star.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Two days         before yesterday I parked my car at the airport and took a yellow cab         back to my apartment where I watched television, all day. On &quot;Book         TV&quot; a male poet spent an hour and four minutes introducing a haiku         that lasted seconds. He spoke of scientists who find metaphors like money         in the street, the paradigm of webs, and men who write poems about themselves         after dreams of flying, rotten teeth, and foreign places. I sat on the         rug you brought me from Thailand and shook. It had been thundering and         Id just finished soundproofing my heart. Body sweaty with an interpretation         of television and lightning, it was the beginning or end of a blue illness         diagnosed by pages of post holiday writing. Words reconstructing the places         wed learned each othera ghost haunting her own life. </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">V.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I have chewed         off my leg and packed it in Styrofoam peanuts, Candy Corn and confetti,         in a brown box with only a return address. </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is just         a metaphor, the result of too much red wine, word-processing and alliteration.         At the keys, I bite my truths to keep from typing in tongues.

I constructed you a text without using the letter E then walked         to our breakfast place and consumed two plates of vegetable scramble,         rosemary potatoes, sausages and raisin toast. The waitress we like, the         one with the asymmetrical silver hair, asked where my friend was and I         said I didnt know.

For your welcome,         Ive written you a fruit basket full of fresh pineapples, pears, mangos         and blood oranges. I will continue to rewrite the fruit as it rots. I         replaced pineapple with kiwi, pear with honeydew. I composed a sentence         that said <i>I</i> was rotting when I meant to say <i>it</i>. It is difficult         to keep my pronouns straight. I placed ambiguity in the basket.

Blue is to be alive, to make sentences, to unaccept.         In blue, your return is not as essential as your departure and prolonged         distance. Ive wrapped whats left of me in blue. My walls are blue and         Ive taken to wearing my eye shadow blue. Ive found a religion in the         semiotics of color, like schools, hospitals, churches, nurseries and mad         houses<i>Sweetheart, come</i>. Travel by air. From my distance, I can         still make out your brow when youre angry, distinguish your blue eyes,         sad. Eggflower, are you angry or sad?

I will wait for you in the tiny bar near United.         I will order Bloody Marys in twos, pay the extras dollars for the doubles,         and tell the man or woman who brings them that &quot;I am waiting for         Eggflower to land.&quot;</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IX. </font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">February.         Hearts are everywhere and everyone is buying.

Your         angry brow and sad eyes, I cannot picture. Your mouth is an anomaly. Listening         to Holiday and Waits, I reread your postcards, the latest from a city         I can locate: Paris. They are in French. I look up every word in my French-English         dictionary. I am diligent; however, the words narrate encyclopedic persons,         places, and things. For this female, your distance is becoming a desperation         to construct meaning. What is the meaning of <i>your</i> <i>distance</i>?         I have filled the empty papyrus, meant for inventive mapmaking, with two         words: <i>your</i> and <i>distance</i>. I have eliminated the adjective         <i>your</i>, the possessive form of you. In my epistemology, I am left         with only distance: <i>the separation in space and time; the interval         separating any two specified instants in time, the degree of deviation         or difference that separates two things in a relationship; a point or         area that is faraway.</i></font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eggflower,         you are becoming a beautiful word. <i>Eggflower</i>.
