      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In one chapter 
        of the novel I am writing, a cow fuses identities with a pile of lumber. 
        This was written by narrating each knot and fiber in the nine wood planks 
        directly above the sofa in my bedroom. If someone, having read this chapter, 
        were to unknowingly rent my room long after I had left it, they would 
        no doubt recognize the planks. Writing, when based on the impersonation 
        of objects, has the potential to operate simultaneously in every conceivable 
        register of meaning. The widely reverberating skin thus created&#8212;when worn 
        either as a bodysuit or a municipality&#8212;will make us better lovers. The 
        cult of individuality will wane when the individual has made this leap 
        to becoming a practical god; the elastic band of Greek tragedy will snap, 
        and love will roll forward in a blind cascade of punches. I enjoy inventing 
        covert seduction schemes, then confessing them shamelessly to simple machines 
        and home furnishings.</font></p>

        Man</font></b></font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An 
        old man, and not a very pleasant man to look at, lay in pale daylight 
        in a wide bed consuming the greater part of the room. Behind him to either 
        side was a low window, its wooden quadrants painted white, overlooking 
        the back of the building before the fence where trash was kept. He smoked 
        a cigar. The room had once been mine. An illiterate maid and myself have 
        been placed in charge of his care. He said to me as he held the phone 
        receiver to his head, &quot;And who is able to speak such things over 
        the wire...Only the dead can.&quot;</font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Often, 
        his statements, and especially this one, filled me with horror and incomprehension. 
        In the beginning, I had tried to ascertain their meaning by asking him 
        erudite, undaunted questions regarding their syntactic construction or 
        his own position as a speaker. These approaches had brought nothing but 
        pain as they played in the field of a game whose master he, indisputably, 
        was. Now I had given over, given over everything to his mastery. I reduced 
        myself shamefully before him, asking the most naive of questions, renouncing 
        any appearance of recognizing the grace of his spoken forms, seeming not 
        to catch his poise, complaining, &quot;I do not understand how the two 
        parts of that statement go together.&quot; While prodigious questions 
        only peaked his cynical sportsmanship, that taut mechanization of things 
        and their opposites, these tiny, pathetic inquiries sent him into a chaos. 
        He began to mumble, forcing cigars from his reserve behind the bedpost 
        upon me, forcing the wet end of his cigar into my mouth, begging me, making 
        me smoke it, lighting another for himself and beginning, too, to smoke, 
        reeling back and forth as though his spine had liquefied, perspiring, 
        eyes drooped swollenly closed.</font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        did not allow myself the cover of terror that I whimpered for in all his 
        limitless rancor. I grabbed the cigar from my teeth and hurled it out 
        the window to burn what it might and die out. I spoke to him meekly, through 
        infantile wellings of tears, trying to forge some pattern by which I might 
        join together the two parts of his statement. &quot;Today I wrote a story, 
        as short as a single page, nebulous of plot. The beginning is heady and 
        muffled as though caught in foam. By the end, something has clearly happened. 
        But,&quot; I broke off, &quot;how can these two things fit together?&quot; 
        He seemed to be looking off somewhere else, frozen there cadaverously. 
        But he was not dead&#8212;how had he the right to speak for the dead, turning 
        each article before a chilling noun to an exclusive &quot;we&quot;? In 
        my room as in all of the rooms here, the foliate branches of some lanky 
        Mediterranean plant were tacked up along the seams of the walls, nestling 
        in the upper corners. I followed the line of the stalks down with my eyes 
        to the splintered, whitening nub where they had been broken off from their 
        trunk.</font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Winding 
        slowly away from the house, I wrote a chart to which I could apply the 
        man&#8217;s teachings. At the top was written &quot;the story,&quot; next, &quot;the 
        self,&quot; and last, &quot;the dead.&quot; A young woman&#8217;s path crossed 
        mine. She asked me what I was writing. &quot;I am writing fiction,&quot; 
        I said. &quot;The worst of all,&quot; she replied, &quot;because it is 
        so...&quot; and we finished in unison, &quot;invisible.&quot; </font></p>

        the time you used yourself to a dry nub, and also forget how you promised 
        never to stop fucking once you had started. The dry tip at the finger 
        end, down the railway. Screams outward five men down a gorge. Forget about 
        the time your hair was cut as splinter in my palm, the wet spot on the 
        back of the four-door. The metallic suck on the taste of the cut, the 
        land membrane slipping into a forehead of trash. When will it stop being 
        Monday in our urges? A mundane tulip is being urged on a mountebank. He 
        lives in a dug-out mother.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We plotted 
        the cell wall, watched protoplasts stream across the landscape. Called 
        it a rosarium but pissed it with daffodils, tulips because today is New 
        England and the red south land mimics the vomit of our last February&#8212;all 
        starts in memorium&#8212;an update from the loo&#8212;Miss Rebekah says...</font></p>

        awaiting a curtain call. To step forth, guarded with juniper sprigs, wearing 
        only placenta, and to violate the earth for a tribal encore. Why else

        suffering lightly or without some process. The toe in regeneration, and 
        the ribcage&#8212;caught a bird beneath its zenith and swang. [Or] sang the 
        morning song quite consistently off-key. And so the toe turning, the pinkest 
        pig of the lot on my palette. Says, forgive the merriment on eastern after, 
        a gnomon. A concubine under the wardrobe. A cardinal, direction in spring. 
        Oh Chaucer&#8212;the birds maken melodie beneath my screenless window. The smoke&#8212;not 
        yet ancient.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of us 
        is in danger of using the word citizen soon. I like food that you don&#8217;t 
        have to eat slowly to be manipulated by erotically. The references to 
        a beatific past are fast accumulating at the infamous window, growing 
        rapidly rowdy and purloining favours from the women among them. The references 
        to a barbaric ritual are twisting like a screw into the old, dissectable 
        earth. The old, desiccated mourner climbs the song and spies in on our 
        young bodies, selfish and petulant in the deathless flesh scent. Here 
        is an organ for you, dear reader, yes, a kidney, and I scamper back into 
        your hand, where the bush is ready to bloom into flame, to keep eating 
        and eating and eating.</font></p>
