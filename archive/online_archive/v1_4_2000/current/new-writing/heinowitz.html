If someone, having read this chapter,         were to unknowingly rent my room long after I had left it, they would         no doubt recognize the planks. Writing, when based on the impersonation         of objects, has the potential to operate simultaneously in every conceivable         register of meaning. The widely reverberating skin thus createdwhen worn         either as a bodysuit or a municipalitywill make us better lovers. The         cult of individuality will wane when the individual has made this leap         to becoming a practical god; the elastic band of Greek tragedy will snap,         and love will roll forward in a blind cascade of punches. I enjoy inventing         covert seduction schemes, then confessing them shamelessly to simple machines         and home furnishings.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="#ist">IS         THIS JUST FOR SHOW?</a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="#old">OLD         MAN </a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="#pre">PREFACE         3: MOVEMENT, A LOVER</a></b></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <hr>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a name="ist"></a>Is         this just for show?</b></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is         this just for show?<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(generation         1)</font><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Behind him to either         side was a low window, its wooden quadrants painted white, overlooking         the back of the building before the fence where trash was kept. He smoked         a cigar. The room had once been mine. An illiterate maid and myself have         been placed in charge of his care. He said to me as he held the phone         receiver to his head, &quot;And who is able to speak such things over         the wire...Only the dead can.&quot;</font><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Often,         his statements, and especially this one, filled me with horror and incomprehension.         In the beginning, I had tried to ascertain their meaning by asking him         erudite, undaunted questions regarding their syntactic construction or         his own position as a speaker. These approaches had brought nothing but         pain as they played in the field of a game whose master he, indisputably,         was. Now I had given over, given over everything to his mastery. I reduced         myself shamefully before him, asking the most naive of questions, renouncing         any appearance of recognizing the grace of his spoken forms, seeming not         to catch his poise, complaining, &quot;I do not understand how the two         parts of that statement go together.&quot; While prodigious questions         only peaked his cynical sportsmanship, that taut mechanization of things         and their opposites, these tiny, pathetic inquiries sent him into a chaos.         He began to mumble, forcing cigars from his reserve behind the bedpost         upon me, forcing the wet end of his cigar into my mouth, begging me, making         me smoke it, lighting another for himself and beginning, too, to smoke,         reeling back and forth as though his spine had liquefied, perspiring,         eyes drooped swollenly closed.</font><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         did not allow myself the cover of terror that I whimpered for in all his         limitless rancor. I grabbed the cigar from my teeth and hurled it out         the window to burn what it might and die out. I spoke to him meekly, through         infantile wellings of tears, trying to forge some pattern by which I might         join together the two parts of his statement. &quot;Today I wrote a story,         as short as a single page, nebulous of plot. The beginning is heady and         muffled as though caught in foam. By the end, something has clearly happened.         But,&quot; I broke off, &quot;how can these two things fit together?&quot;         He seemed to be looking off somewhere else, frozen there cadaverously.         But he was not deadhow had he the right to speak for the dead, turning         each article before a chilling noun to an exclusive &quot;we&quot;? In         my room as in all of the rooms here, the foliate branches of some lanky         Mediterranean plant were tacked up along the seams of the walls, nestling         in the upper corners. I followed the line of the stalks down with my eyes         to the splintered, whitening nub where they had been broken off from their         trunk.</font><br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Winding         slowly away from the house, I wrote a chart to which I could apply the         mans teachings.

She asked me what I was writing. &quot;I am writing fiction,&quot;         I said. &quot;The worst of all,&quot; she replied, &quot;because it is         so...&quot; and we finished in unison, &quot;invisible.&quot; </font></p>      <hr>      <p><font size="3"><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><a name="pre"></a>Preface         3</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">:</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>        </font></font><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Movement,         a lover</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Forget about         the time you used yourself to a dry nub, and also forget how you promised         never to stop fucking once you had started.
