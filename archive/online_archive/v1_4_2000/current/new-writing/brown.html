      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My work 
        often begins with my hearing a sound, a phrase, a sentence. Often I don&#8217;t 
        know what this sound phrase sentence means. It has to go over and over 
        in my head and then slowly it squeezes more words out and I am, fitfully, 
        writing. This &quot;description&quot; comes from, I think, realizing that 
        a lot of my work is about the same thing&#8212;trying to describe this dark, 
        low, bitten, something inside of me. I wrote this piece after finishing 
        my book <i>The Dogs</i>, on which I worked for more than ten years. Then 
        I realized that book had not exorcized my dogs and here I was again. One 
        version of the title is in homage to, stolen from, with genuflections 
        toward, Kafka, one of whose most early fragments is called &quot;description 
        of a struggle.&quot; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m still trying to do, describe the 
        same struggle again in which I am.</font></p>

        it slipped from me and then, because I needed<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have not been when I was young.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was young I was not as I am. 
        It may have been but I nor knew nor recognized.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was, when I was young, resilient, 
        full of hope. I had not learned to not have hope.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am no longer young.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always 
        it is here except for sometimes. Especially when I think that I&#8217;m about 
        to stop, succumb, be fed to it, pressed underneath, for which I would 
        not be ungrateful, no, would, rather, please, I prithee&#8212;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It releases me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am released not by a thing I do 
        but it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever is done is done by it. Whatever 
        I do is naught. I nothing am.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it lifts me and I am again.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am grateful then ashamed of 
        being grateful, even glad, to be at all again.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m 
        grateful, when it lets me go, as if it has been kind to me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I make these tearful promises. I 
        say that I have learned this time, as if I have not learned before, as 
        if those other times were naught, although they weren&#8217;t, they were, they 
        are, still, yes, each, every one of them, yes, all, I bear the marks, 
        see, here, where I am bent, the lines and cuts, the bruises, scars, the 
        nightmares, the prosthetic.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pick myself up gingerly, the hand, 
        the knees, the forehead scraped and bloodied. Gravel in palm, dirt in 
        cuts across the knees. The hair in clumps. Abrasions across, lacerations 
        within the protrusions (forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin). The nails chewed 
        and bloodied. The back swaybacked from the pushing down. The bones of 
        the elbows chipped from attempting to hold up, though not succeeding, 
        the belly not entirely dragging but almost. The shirt flapping, spotted 
        with holes, the cloth apparently ancient though in fact recently young, 
        care with personal appearance having gone by the by some time ago, the 
        collar frayed, the ends of the sleeves frayed, their color a ruddy rusty 
        red, a sanguine hue, browning, blackening, expanding in spots, the rest 
        of the shirt something of a shell-gray beige suggesting what once may 
        have been white, clean, young or new though no longer, however, is. The 
        end of an arm is a stump.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knees have been heroic. With 
        the stump and the hand they too have attempted to remove themselves. The 
        knees are hairless, scraped, bloodied, though not scabbed having never 
        been given sufficient respite from crawling to form into scabs. They rather 
        have been in contact with the ground apparently constantly which is gravelly, 
        gritty, grainy, sandy, with little splinters of glass therein, sticky, 
        dusty, hot in spots, you could fry an egg on it some days, icy in others, 
        lukewarm, like if you spit it out of your mouth in others, severely slippery 
        when wet, wet, as if covered with a thin layer of oil or grease, either 
        auto, truck or otherwise, black ice it is called in these parts, a dreaded 
        road condition, slanted, sloped, cliffed, so either one is clawing oneself 
        up against the pull of gravity, against which one <i>cannot </i>argue, 
        it has its laws, or one is clawing with what is left of one&#8217;s nails or 
        ersatz nails, gore or stitches, to keep from slipping sliding falling 
        being dragged by the pull of gravity, against which one <i>cannot</i> 
        argue, it has its laws, down. The knees, hand and stump continue to be 
        gushy, gunky, gory, gross, gelatinous in part, deeply unpleasant on whole, 
        yet also with stitches, unsightly undoubtedly, yet nonetheless installed 
        by Someone: Whom ?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An act of Kindness?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mystery.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps 
        what I remember is a lie. Perhaps I just remember what I want. Perhaps 
        I always knew the laws I fear.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
        it lifts itself and with it, me, then am I raised and grateful so it seems.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if it&#8217;s like the change in altitude 
        in coming up from the ocean, from whence one never should have sunk, where 
        life is neither meant to go, though if it does, ought to desist and not 
        return, for if it does, it does diminished like that child I knew when 
        I was young, who fell in the pool and almost drowned, who should have 
        drowned but didn&#8217;t, was rather &quot;saved&quot; to &quot;live&quot; in 
        a coma on a diagonally slanted plank or &quot;bed&quot; in what was once 
        the family living room, but then became, as it continues to be, the &quot;treatment&quot; 
        room, yes, continues for she is still &quot;living&quot;, now in her forties, 
        as she has for the past three decades, breathing, receiving IV nourishment, 
        evacuating, all with assistance as she will for the rest of her miserable 
        fucking &quot;life&quot; like a fucking vegetable while her poor pathetic 
        delusional babbling mother, now some kind of religious nut, prays faithfully, 
        still, after all these years, for pity&#8217;s sake, for her little girl to 
        recover while her husband, having not been able to stand the sight of 
        his beloved daughter drooling her fucking life away, left, and honestly, 
        who could blame him, the poor bastard, then only after years of serious 
        boozing, was finally, at long last, able to off himself by, rumor has 
        it, means involving a plastic bag, all the while nutty ol&#8217; mom continues 
        to pray, babble and hope like crazy that her vegetable girl, excuse me, 
        vegetable woman, can still yet somehow against all reason, against all 
        odds, against all that is that is decent, good or right, by means, that 
        is, of some dark miracle, recover.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if it is like the speed, 
        as in a coming up from the ocean, something deeper than a merely nearly 
        lethal suburban family swimming pool, too fast, from whence one never 
        should have fallen, although one did, then being expelled, ejected, thrown, 
        tossed, heaved, wretched up as in a vomiting forth, too rapidly, that 
        makes one giddy, disoriented, distraught and temporarily out of mind, 
        temporarily buoyant as if shot through with hope, with light, or rather 
        a thing mistaken for light, a flash or jolt or electrical event or something 
        that induces or makes way for something else the name of which I cannot 
        recall, the nature of which I cannot create, although the memory of which, 
        because it is no more, although I so believed when I was young, (I am 
        no longer young) once seemed or was, or if it is like nothing else at 
        all.</font></p>

        can of course the human way, like any body can, with flesh, how we, both 
        each and both both can and do, and this is good and I am glad but this 
        is not enough.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
        want some thing impossible. I want to be of you, inside, the same as you.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want us skinned, beneath the flesh, 
        the beating viscera. I want where some thing was that still remains. Where 
        what we are is not the two, the separate, but the one.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you open, wide, before the 
        close, the seam, the covering. I want the willful opening where I can 
        push inside. I want me in.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&#8217;t actually imagine this. I 
        mean, I&#8217;m capable of imagining a lot, but there&#8217;s a way that what one 
        can actually imagine, if one is imagining right, could actually really 
        happen. But this could not, not all of it, so I cannot, not all of it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know where to stop.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see my hand, an opening. The opening 
        is yours, you&#8217;re open, I am going in, the fingers first, this part&#8217;s familiar, 
        one, a pair or three, the whole hand then. I&#8217;m careful. Then the knuckles 
        go, pressed close and small like a bunch of twigs, in, out, then in again 
        and then the wide part of the hand which cannot bend as much, can&#8217;t shrink. 
        I&#8217;m very careful now.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this OK?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pause.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then slowly, more, the back 
        of it, the whole of it, it&#8217;s all inside then held as if by something sucking 
        wet and warm then pulling.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this OK?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Yes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then careful, slowly up, the wrist, 
        the thick part then the thin. Another pause.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is not comfortable 
        at first, we take much care and then the hand is fully in.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine what I&#8217;ve seen.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then now there is the other one, 
        yes, both of them at once.</font></p>
      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
        part is hard to see. I mean, I can&#8217;t really imagine this part like the 
        other, what with bones and all. Though of course there&#8217;s also birth though 
        that is not the same though has its similarities so one might imagine 
        so I attempt.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to explain in a picture 
        what something might look like which cannot be pictured because it&#8217;s about 
        what I can&#8217;t see.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, then I see, that is, then it is 
        my arms.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then&#8212;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait. Wait. This isn&#8217;t possible. I must 
        be losing it. Maybe I&#8217;ve already lost it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is where I&#8217;m most at home. Where 
        what cannot, where what will never, can. Where what can only be desired 
        is.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always only partly lived. Part of 
        me, I think, was not full born.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To return: Both my arms are inside.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You hold your breath and I do too.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am extremely careful. I push, you pull, 
        extremely carefully, my forearms to my elbows up.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My elbows have never felt like this before. 
        At least not that I can remember. The hair on my arms is matted, swept 
        backwards like something swimming, like a thing that&#8217;s being fully born 
        but backwards. (Like the arm of the vet up the hole of a cow with a calf 
        calving upside down).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of my arm I can see is wet and 
        slick. Inside it looks how no-one can see.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am inside further, to my biceps, 
        to the line where the sleeves of my t-shirts stop. Then I am going in 
        with my Shoulders.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is impossible. Not to 
        mention ridiculous. Nonetheless. It&#8217;s like swimming the breaststroke or 
        the butterfly. The shoulders tense and pull so that if someone was behind 
        or above, as you are of me, they (you) could see, if their (your) eyes 
        were open. I don&#8217;t know if yours are. I&#8217;m not looking.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we look at one another and sometimes 
        those are the most awed and humbling frightening times but I don&#8217;t know 
        if we do this time. Perhaps it should be the most private, interior, eye-closed 
        moment, but it could also be a moment to look. I want you to do what you 
        want. But if someone, you, would look, you could see muscles in the shoulders 
        flex, release then pull again, except of course I don&#8217;t pull my arms back, 
        I couldn&#8217;t, not like this, without doing damage. I keep them forward, 
        up, inside you.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my head is inside too. I don&#8217;t 
        remember it going in. Like a crowning backwards maybe. I don&#8217;t, although 
        I wish I could, remember. The top of my head, where there&#8217;s the part in 
        my hair, would have felt it first like the water they sprinkle on your 
        head when you are received into an order.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miraculously, wonderfully, inspiringly, 
        like those dreams I have of breathing under water, those dreams I have 
        of flying, which I do by a kind of breast stroke in the air, above the 
        world, I&#8217;m breathing here inside of you, alive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it&#8217;s different. Not like I&#8217;m 
        coming up through you, but as if there has been a seam, like in one of 
        those thick plastic oval coin purses that you just squeeze top to bottom 
        and they open up. You have an opening like that, smooth edged, not torn, 
        this is its purpose. (I think I have one too, but now is not my turn though 
        that will come.) Or maybe it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re like a big jumpsuit of yourself, 
        like you have a zipper of flesh from the bottom of your stomach to the 
        bottom of your neck that you open up.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve entered you from that long middle 
        place and I can feel the soft insides of you, intestines, stomach, guts, 
        then the firmer liver, bean-shaped kidneys, connective strings, as taut 
        as harp or fiddle strings, but pliable as the strings of a violin. I feel 
        this all with all me, with hands and mouth and skin and I am glad.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also is, of course, the blood. 
        It&#8217;s all around, I swim in it, but it is not a wound or hemorrhage. You 
        are not in danger. It&#8217;s like everything is in an ultra-thin, see-through 
        plastic wrap. No, that&#8217;s not quite right. It&#8217;s not so contained that none 
        of it gets on me because some of it does. I like it. I like the slippery, 
        slightly sticky wet. So, rather than an entirely impermeable barrier, 
        let it be more like one of those noisy crinkly bread wrappers with all 
        the little holes, a porous membrane. I shouldn&#8217;t have said noisy. It&#8217;s 
        quiet here. There&#8217;s a hum or pulse and swishing sounds, things opening 
        and closing, moving and coursing, but evenly, firmly, comforting sounds, 
        not irritating noise. In any event, neither a &quot;bleeding&quot; in 
        the sense of an untoward letting resultant from some a broken or wounded 
        thing nor an unpleasant &quot;noise&quot; rather only the regular sound 
        of right and natural movement.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pulled in where it is warm as 
        milk. It smells a little that too, vaguely metallic, like iron or rust, 
        and steamy and close and comforting.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am not alone in here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you&#8217;re inside here too; you&#8217;re 
        inside you.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;re smaller or larger. I&#8217;m made 
        the size that fits.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, you&#8217;re in here too, there&#8217;s 
        two of us now, and the amazing this is, it doesn&#8217;t bother the big outside 
        you. The big outside you doesn&#8217;t feel queasy or sick the way one might 
        if there were something, two things actually, crawling around inside one&#8217;s 
        guts and one felt like one was going to be sick. You don&#8217;t feel sick at 
        all. It also doesn&#8217;t look from the outside like there&#8217;s a lump or a growth 
        or two, or one big one actually because we stick so close together, or 
        like that alien baby from the movie, it just looks fairly normal, maybe 
        a bulge or a thickening around the middle, but nothing anyone would be 
        concerned about, more something they would see and think oh how nice, 
        a bun in the oven. But of course, there&#8217;s no one else around. We only 
        do this when we&#8217;re alone. But if the big you were to look down at yourself, 
        you wouldn&#8217;t see anything unnatural only maybe a bulge or thickening around 
        the middle.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We slip around inside so easily, 
        like a couple of kids in the snow except it&#8217;s warm. Maybe actually we&#8217;re 
        more like a couple of kids on one of those Slippy Slides like I remember 
        from the 60&#8217;s when I was a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember?</font></p>

        somewhere there is light.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way, though thick and dark, is 
        clear. There is a noise, a pulse and I am pulling in. I&#8217;m swimming to 
        the core of you, I&#8217;m almost there, I have come far almost enough.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reach out with my wanting hand.<br>
