Often I dont         know what this sound phrase sentence means. It has to go over and over         in my head and then slowly it squeezes more words out and I am, fitfully,         writing. This &quot;description&quot; comes from, I think, realizing that         a lot of my work is about the same thingtrying to describe this dark,         low, bitten, something inside of me. I wrote this piece after finishing         my book <i>The Dogs</i>, on which I worked for more than ten years. Then         I realized that book had not exorcized my dogs and here I was again. One         version of the title is in homage to, stolen from, with genuflections         toward, Kafka, one of whose most early fragments is called &quot;description         of a struggle.&quot; Thats what Im still trying to do, describe the         same struggle again in which I am.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#ade">A         DESCRIPTION OR DESCRIPTION OF A STRUGGLE</a></font></b></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="#eno">ENOUGH</a></b></font></p>      <hr>      <p align="center"><font size="3"><b><a name="ade"></a><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A         Description</font></b></font></p>      <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Or</b></font></p>      <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Description         of a Struggle</b></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p> &#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im         trying to describe it again.<br>        </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has not changed although         it slipped from me and then, because I needed<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to, as always I have done,         I misremembered.      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Although         I cant forget entirely for always it returns.</font>       <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always         it was here except for sometimes.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although perhaps thats not the case.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have not been when I was young.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was young I was not as I am.         It may have been but I nor knew nor recognized.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was, when I was young, resilient,         full of hope.

Gravel in palm, dirt in         cuts across the knees. The hair in clumps. Abrasions across, lacerations         within the protrusions (forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin). The nails chewed         and bloodied. The back swaybacked from the pushing down. The bones of         the elbows chipped from attempting to hold up, though not succeeding,         the belly not entirely dragging but almost. The shirt flapping, spotted         with holes, the cloth apparently ancient though in fact recently young,         care with personal appearance having gone by the by some time ago, the         collar frayed, the ends of the sleeves frayed, their color a ruddy rusty         red, a sanguine hue, browning, blackening, expanding in spots, the rest         of the shirt something of a shell-gray beige suggesting what once may         have been white, clean, young or new though no longer, however, is. The         end of an arm is a stump.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knees have been heroic. With         the stump and the hand they too have attempted to remove themselves. The         knees are hairless, scraped, bloodied, though not scabbed having never         been given sufficient respite from crawling to form into scabs. They rather         have been in contact with the ground apparently constantly which is gravelly,         gritty, grainy, sandy, with little splinters of glass therein, sticky,         dusty, hot in spots, you could fry an egg on it some days, icy in others,         lukewarm, like if you spit it out of your mouth in others, severely slippery         when wet, wet, as if covered with a thin layer of oil or grease, either         auto, truck or otherwise, black ice it is called in these parts, a dreaded         road condition, slanted, sloped, cliffed, so either one is clawing oneself         up against the pull of gravity, against which one <i>cannot </i>argue,         it has its laws, or one is clawing with what is left of ones nails or         ersatz nails, gore or stitches, to keep from slipping sliding falling         being dragged by the pull of gravity, against which one <i>cannot</i>         argue, it has its laws, down. The knees, hand and stump continue to be         gushy, gunky, gory, gross, gelatinous in part, deeply unpleasant on whole,         yet also with stitches, unsightly undoubtedly, yet nonetheless installed         by Someone: Whom ?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An act of Kindness?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mystery.</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps         what I remember is a lie.

The opening         is yours, youre open, I am going in, the fingers first, this parts familiar,         one, a pair or three, the whole hand then. Im careful. Then the knuckles         go, pressed close and small like a bunch of twigs, in, out, then in again         and then the wide part of the hand which cannot bend as much, cant shrink.         Im very careful now.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this OK?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pause.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then slowly, more, the back         of it, the whole of it, its all inside then held as if by something sucking         wet and warm then pulling.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this OK?<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Yes.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then careful, slowly up, the wrist,         the thick part then the thin. Another pause.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is not comfortable         at first, we take much care and then the hand is fully in.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine what Ive seen.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then now there is the other one,         yes, both of them at once.</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This         part is hard to see. I mean, I cant really imagine this part like the         other, what with bones and all. Though of course theres also birth though         that is not the same though has its similarities so one might imagine         so I attempt.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to explain in a picture         what something might look like which cannot be pictured because its about         what I cant see.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, then I see, that is, then it is         my arms.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait. Wait. This isnt possible. I must         be losing it. Maybe Ive already lost it.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is where Im most at home. Where         what cannot, where what will never, can. Where what can only be desired         is.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always only partly lived. Part of         me, I think, was not full born.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To return: Both my arms are inside.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You hold your breath and I do too.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am extremely careful. I push, you pull,         extremely carefully, my forearms to my elbows up.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My elbows have never felt like this before.         At least not that I can remember. The hair on my arms is matted, swept         backwards like something swimming, like a thing thats being fully born         but backwards. (Like the arm of the vet up the hole of a cow with a calf         calving upside down).<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end of my arm I can see is wet and         slick. Inside it looks how no-one can see.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am inside further, to my biceps,         to the line where the sleeves of my t-shirts stop. Then I am going in         with my Shoulders.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is impossible. Not to         mention ridiculous. Nonetheless. Its like swimming the breaststroke or         the butterfly. The shoulders tense and pull so that if someone was behind         or above, as you are of me, they (you) could see, if their (your) eyes         were open. I dont know if yours are. Im not looking.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we look at one another and sometimes         those are the most awed and humbling frightening times but I dont know         if we do this time. Perhaps it should be the most private, interior, eye-closed         moment, but it could also be a moment to look. I want you to do what you         want. But if someone, you, would look, you could see muscles in the shoulders         flex, release then pull again, except of course I dont pull my arms back,         I couldnt, not like this, without doing damage. I keep them forward,         up, inside you.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my head is inside too. I dont         remember it going in. Like a crowning backwards maybe. I dont, although         I wish I could, remember. The top of my head, where theres the part in         my hair, would have felt it first like the water they sprinkle on your         head when you are received into an order.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miraculously, wonderfully, inspiringly,         like those dreams I have of breathing under water, those dreams I have         of flying, which I do by a kind of breast stroke in the air, above the         world, Im breathing here inside of you, alive.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then its different. Not like Im         coming up through you, but as if there has been a seam, like in one of         those thick plastic oval coin purses that you just squeeze top to bottom         and they open up. You have an opening like that, smooth edged, not torn,         this is its purpose. (I think I have one too, but now is not my turn though         that will come.) Or maybe its like youre like a big jumpsuit of yourself,         like you have a zipper of flesh from the bottom of your stomach to the         bottom of your neck that you open up.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ive entered you from that long middle         place and I can feel the soft insides of you, intestines, stomach, guts,         then the firmer liver, bean-shaped kidneys, connective strings, as taut         as harp or fiddle strings, but pliable as the strings of a violin. I feel         this all with all me, with hands and mouth and skin and I am glad.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also is, of course, the blood.         Its all around, I swim in it, but it is not a wound or hemorrhage. You         are not in danger. Its like everything is in an ultra-thin, see-through         plastic wrap. No, thats not quite right. Its not so contained that none         of it gets on me because some of it does. I like it. I like the slippery,         slightly sticky wet. So, rather than an entirely impermeable barrier,         let it be more like one of those noisy crinkly bread wrappers with all         the little holes, a porous membrane. I shouldnt have said noisy. Its         quiet here. Theres a hum or pulse and swishing sounds, things opening         and closing, moving and coursing, but evenly, firmly, comforting sounds,         not irritating noise. In any event, neither a &quot;bleeding&quot; in         the sense of an untoward letting resultant from some a broken or wounded         thing nor an unpleasant &quot;noise&quot; rather only the regular sound         of right and natural movement.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pulled in where it is warm as         milk. It smells a little that too, vaguely metallic, like iron or rust,         and steamy and close and comforting.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am not alone in here.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For youre inside here too; youre         inside you.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youre smaller or larger. Im made         the size that fits.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, youre in here too, theres         two of us now, and the amazing this is, it doesnt bother the big outside         you. The big outside you doesnt feel queasy or sick the way one might         if there were something, two things actually, crawling around inside ones         guts and one felt like one was going to be sick. You dont feel sick at         all. It also doesnt look from the outside like theres a lump or a growth         or two, or one big one actually because we stick so close together, or         like that alien baby from the movie, it just looks fairly normal, maybe         a bulge or a thickening around the middle, but nothing anyone would be         concerned about, more something they would see and think oh how nice,         a bun in the oven. But of course, theres no one else around. We only         do this when were alone. But if the big you were to look down at yourself,         you wouldnt see anything unnatural only maybe a bulge or thickening around         the middle.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We slip around inside so easily,         like a couple of kids in the snow except its warm. Maybe actually were         more like a couple of kids on one of those Slippy Slides like I remember         from the 60s when I was a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember?</font></p>      <p><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From         somewhere there is light.<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way, though thick and dark, is         clear.
