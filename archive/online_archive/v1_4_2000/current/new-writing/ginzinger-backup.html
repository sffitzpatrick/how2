        Ginzinger </font></b></p>

        Note</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When I think 
        about my writing and the themes I am drawn to or tend to use, I am struck 
        by an image.  My mind conjures up Hokusai's silk-screen tidal wave, with 
        its hundreds of finger-like water sprays that reach out to grasp the faceless, 
        crouched figures in the boat, who remain frozen on silk and forever await 
        the crushing wave.  My writing tends to focus on these moments of suspension, 
        at times on the awesome, but destructive power of the wave, and at other 
        times on the fate of the boaters.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When words 
        I overhear or scenes I witness compel me enough to either jot them down 
        or commit them to memory, strange things seem to happen.  For example, 
        about a year ago while listening to public radio I heard for the first 
        time about the bus accident Frida Kahlo survived at age 18, only to be 
        tormented the rest of her life by the damage to her spine and pelvis.  
        I could (almost) imagine the pain.  A week later, PBS broadcast a special 
        on Diego Rivera, which revealed their tumultuous relationship, and the 
        complications her accident brought to their marriage.  The following weekend, 
        I visited friends in Chicago.  We wander into a Mexican restaurant for 
        lunch and on the wall, held in a large picture frame, is the likeness 
        of Frida Kahlo.  She glares from across the room, and I think, &quot;why 
        is she following me?&quot;  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Coincidence?  
        Maybe...but then I am compelled to run out and buy a book of her paintings.  
        I peruse. I mull.  I write.  &quot;The Spiral and the Cycle&quot; happens.  
        Borrowing images from certain paintings in the book, I explore and elucidate 
        my own creative process.</font></p>

        The objects can be anything&#8212;there just needs to be a lot of them. Obviously, 
        size is a concern, too. They have to be things which can fit on a bed

        a clock, etc.)&#8212;unless the bed is extremely oversized. </i></font></p>

        of Scene 1) is tied to the headboard, and drapes across the length of 
        the bed to dangle down next to Freddie. As if it is Rapunzel's hair, Freddie

        her heels firmly stuck in stirrups. She wears a hospital gown and another 
        sheet is draped across her mid-section which protrudes up from her torso, 
        the bed and her thighs, even though her knees are bent and her feet flat 
        on the bed. The Surgeon sits on a swivel foot-stool at the foot of the 
        bed and between her open legs. He stares straight ahead. A tray table 
        holding instruments stands to the right of the Surgeon. The bedsheets 
        are stained with blood. But rather than splotches or large spots of blood 
        soaking into the sheets, the blood lies sprayed across the sheets, as 
        if it had shot out from open wounds in the wrists by panicked and flailing 
        arms. Freddie is expelling large bursts of air from her lungs in groups 
        of two. The sound of a metronome ticks out the time and an oversized metronome

      <p><font size="3">Surgeon:&#9;Just shut your trap. All your questions and

      <p><font size="3">Freddie:&#9;Okay, but&#8230;</font></p>

      <p><i><font size="3">The stage is lit in yellow light. Freddie stands a 
        few feet in front of an orange-red mango, a sliced-open fleshy watermelon, 
        a papaya, and a bunch of bananas. Her back is to the audience. She has 
        her head tilted to one side, resting on her right hand which rests on 
        her left arm, bent at the elbow. She shakes her head and walks up to the 
        fruit. Freddie guides each piece of fruit with her hands, carefully placing 
        the mango next to the melon, the bananas to the left of them, etc. She 
        then steps back to examine the affect. A dove flies down, on cables preferably, 
        and lands between Freddie and the fruit. Freddie waves her arms at the 
        dove.</font></i></p>
