      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        was in the last days of 1961. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        had just come back from a year in England where I studied English. It 
        had been a very hard year. I&#8217;d come out from boarding school to be in 
        a huge metropolis and the most difficult thing for me was to interrupt 
        my Philosophy courses. But the everyday life in London, the beauty of 
        the English language, going to the theater and the museums gradually compensated 
        for it. It was the great days of the British theatre. I had a pronounciation 
        Professor who was a teacher at a prestigious drama school and he sent 
        me to all the important productions: I saw &#8220;Fings aren't what they 
        used to be&#8221;, the Joan Littlewood production; also &#8220;The Hostage&#8221; 
        by Brendan Behan,&#8220;A Taste of Honey&#8221; by Sheila Delaney (both 
        produced and directed by Joan Littlewood!) and Ionesco's &#8220;Rhinoceros&#8221; 
        with Lawrence Olivier  at the Sloane Square theatre . It was the big scandal 
        of the year for Olivier was playing with Joan Plowright, and he had just 
        announced that he was leaving his beautiful wife of many years,Vivien 
        Leigh, for Plowright. Public curiosity was such that she was forced to 
        stop playing. I was shocked that it had to be the woman who was asked 
        to leave and not the man.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
        I enrolled in Beirut at the Ecole des Lettres to start a degree in Philosophy. 
        My parents lived in Damascus, so they took a room for me in a &#8220;Foyer 
        de Jeunes Filles&#8221; run by nuns in civilian clothes (we called it &#8216;the 
        bordello&#8217;) which made them think they were extremely liberal. It was a 
        big change for me from the horrible convent where I had spent my high 
        school years and quite a regression compared to my year in London. But 
        I was going to study Philosophy and that was all that mattered.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We 
        were a few girls there, enrolled in various Universities but I was the 
        only one in Humanities. There was a medical student whom we never saw, 
        and two inseperable girls who had the room next to mine and whose names 
        were Peggy and Violette&#8212;we called them the Peg and the Violet. The Peg 
        and the Violet told me that I should look for a girl who lived in Alexandria 
        and who came only to take her exams and they predicted that we were going 
        to be great friends, for Josiane was enrolled in Literature and Philosophy 
        but she studied privately at home and came at the end of each semester 
        to present her exams. The French system allowed this freedom as one was 
        not required to attend the courses. When Josiane came, I was away in Damascus. 
        I came back and as I was walking in, the Peg and the Violet were waiting 
        for me and asked me to their room that night so I could meet Josiane.We 
        met and indeed we had a lot to talk about. We ended up in my room talking 
        till the morning. I was the only girl in the dorm to have a private room. 
        And my mother had brought from home a beautiful chest which was to be 
        a buffet in which she stored olives, and apricot jams from home. I managed 
        to put in some books. At the end of the night Josiane admitted having 
        been interested in me only because she had visited my room in my absence 
        and had seen among my books <i>Le Planetarium</i> by Nathalie Sarraute.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
        course we would only read <i>Le Nouveau Roman</i> then, and among the 
        <i>Nouveau Roman</i> she was the only woman, she had this interesting 
        name, and the book's title evoked the stars and the astronomy with which 
        I had always been involved. Also, in those days our affection would go 
        to any author who had an introduction by Jean-Paul Sartre. So we read 
        avidly Genet, Nizan, and Sarraute. I knew nothing of her history&#8212;that 
        she was Russian and came from a broken home, that she was Jewish and that 
        she had to wear the yellow star during the war (but in fact she took the 
        star and  never wore it). She went back and forth from Russia in her early 
        childhood sometimes with her father, sometimes with her mother.Her father 
        was a socialist; she first tried to study chemistry to please him, for 
        he had a plant of chemical dyes. Then she read law and it was only later 
        after she married that she devoted all her time to writing. She said one 
        could not write the same way after having read Proust, Joyce and Virginia 
        Woolf. I loved that prose that went on and on and produced a fascination 
        in itself that was not due to anything particular being said, but was 
        the product of the writing itself. She had signed the <i>Manifeste des 
        121</i> in 1960 , which was a manifesto that included Sartre, Robbe-Grillet, 
        Marguerite Duras etc., against the policy of the French Government in 
        Algeria. Raymond Sarraute, her husband was also a socialist; his mother 
        had been a friend of Rosa Luxembourg.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Among 
        the <i>Nouveau Roman</i> writers, she was the only one published by Gallimard 
        and I would more easily buy a book with the red and a black lines that 
        are the Gallimard design than any other that I did not know. Soon Josiane 
        was to let me know that Gallimard, except for publishing Sarraute, was 
        a very old-fashioned publisher and that all writers who mattered were 
        published by <i>les Editions de Minuit</i>, i.e. Beckett mainly, and she 
        filled my bookcase with the blue and black lines that was the <i>Editions 
        de Minuit</i> distinctive design. Soon I was to read <i>Malone meurt</i>, 
        <i>Fin de Partie</i>, <i>En attendant Godot</i>, etc. As for the <i>Nouveau 
        Roman</i> it was years later that I read Flaubert and I realised that 
        he was indeed the first and most perfect <i>Nouveau Roman</i> writer. 
        I started visiting Josiane in Alexandria where I met a young future professor, 
        Jean-Yves Tadie, who was doing his military service as a corporal in Egypt.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Last 
        year both Jean-Yves Tadie and Josiane reappeared in my life; Josiane from 
        Montreal where she had become a celebrated Philosophy Professor who received 
        a medal from the French government for her work on the French revolution 
        and the French Philosophers; and Tadie, who in the meantime had become 
        the celebrated author of the definitive edition of the complete works 
        of Proust, as well as his most important biographer. Tadie came to dinner 
        to my apppartment in Paris with&#8212;a present the complete works of Nathalie 
        Sarraute that he had edited for <i>les Editions de La Pleiade</i>.</font></p>
