      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Perhaps 
        the most striking element of this new reading of H.D.&#8217;s work is the meeting 
        of two critical approaches which merge seamlessly in Diana Collecott&#8217;s 
        elegant, sometimes passionate, prose. On the one hand, the book is impressively 
        scholarly, particularly in its intertextual reading of Sappho and H.D. 
        Here Collecott provides detailed evidence of where and how Sapphic fragments, 
        phrases and even individual words were reworked in H.D.&#8217;s poetry and prose. 
        Her appendix will clearly be valuable to H.D. scholars to come. On the 
        other hand, the book itself is an imaginative creative exercise in reading, 
        a process Collecott is clearly fascinated by. Not only reading however: 
        Collecott&#8217;s work becomes its own signifying process as she writes herself 
        into and through the key images, words and even letters that recur in 
        H.D.&#8217;s texts and intertexts. It is not surprising that she often quotes 
        from Susan Howe&#8217;s <i>My Emily Dickinson</i> since, at times, her own process 
        of engagement with her subject attains a similar creative intensity.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Through 
        these critical and creative processes, Collecott teases out, to use her 
        own phrase, that most elusive of qualities, a poet&#8217;s sensibility. What 
        I find most exciting here is how, throughout this process, H.D.&#8217;s texts 
        retain and are reinforced in their specificity: their individual flowers, 
        colours and qualities of light. Some of the most evocative readings are 
        those of H.D.&#8217;s topography, the islands, beaches and crossroads that recur 
        as key distinctive elements in her work. Yet, at the same time this book 
        is about a tradition or a community of writing. The textual space Collecott 
        explores here is also clearly related to its cultural contexts, particularly 
        to the silencing and subsequent signifying of marginalised groups, particularly 
        women-identified women. Here Collecott, wearing her learning lightly, 
        draws her threads out through history from H.D. to Sappho to Swinburne 
        to Shakespeare, whilst drawing detailed comparisons between H.D. and her 
        modernist counterparts and H.D. and her poetic inheritors. The wide range 
        of reference is kept in clear focus: a sense of writing in its own time 
        and place is intrinsic to the volume and, throughout, Collecott retains 
        a strong sense of H.D.&#8217;s own time as well as the history of her reception 
        as a writer. It is Sappho however, whose writing and whose existence as 
        a powerful imaginative construct for H.D. and for many others, to whom 
        Collecott keeps returning and it is the Sapphic in H.D.&#8217;s poetics and 
        sexual politics which gives her book its clarity and power.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        importance of H.D. and Sapphic Modernism is in laying open, laying bare, 
        many dimensions of H.D.&#8217;s &quot;Sapphic&quot; intertextuality: not simply 
        her complex engagement with Sappho&#8217;s poetry itself and its literary permutations, 
        but, perhaps more importantly, the profound cultural, political, and artistic 
        implications of &quot;Sapphism&quot; in the early twentieth century. This 
        latter task entails the recovery of an intricate and dense network of 
        women writers whose literary project and whose whole conception of intellectual 
        exchange was distinct from the climate of early modernism and its male 
        collaborators. This task also compels a engagement with a fraught and 
        difficult theoretical territory concerning gender and sexuality, issues 
        which Collecott negotiates with steadiness and clarity. Having persuasively 
        established the centrality of this Sapphic project for H.D., she then 
        gives a reading of the early career, showing the way in which H.D. situates 
        herself in resistance to the contemporary critical programs that in large 
        part determined her reputation. Thus Collecott prepares the way in the 
        final chapters for the articulation of a lesbian poetics in the context 
        of H.D.&#8217;s writing and for a brilliant exploration of H.D.&#8217;s negotiation 
        of the tradition in her rereading of Shakespeare in light of an alternate, 
        homoerotic tradition.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        individual chapters are quite persuasive in defining a cultural and literary 
        territory of Sapphism in modern literature that otherwise is largely obscured 
        in critical treatments. Many critics have preceded Collecott in giving 
        primacy to Sappho as a precursor in H.D.&#8217;s poetry, and excellent studies 
        by Friedman, DuPlessis, Koepfler, Laity, and others give due weight to 
        H.D.&#8217;s lesbian relationships, especially to her relationships with Frances 
        Gregg and Bryher, and to the implications of her bisexuality in her writing, 
        both before and after her crucial analysis with Freud. Collecott acknowledges 
        and benefits from this work. However, with regard to Sappho, her claim, 
        substantiated by argument, is radical: that Sappho is to H.D. what Dante 
        is to Eliot, or Homer to Pound. Moreover, her study represents, with regard 
        to the issue of H.D.&#8217;s sexuality, a different kind of critical effort. 
        Collecott&#8217;s writing enacts in its own way the difficulties that she finds 
        in H.D.&#8217;s lesbian poetics, the obliquity and displacement in attempting 
        to say what is unsayable. Thus, the argument in individual chapters does 
        not proceed in a linear fashion; rather it works by the accretion of overlays. 
        Each chapter gathers up intricate sets of associations, from ancient and 
        modern literature, from H.D.&#8217;s life and writing and from those of her 
        associates and contemporaries, and from nineteenth- and twentieth-century 
        cultural contexts. This mode represents an effort to amplify these many 
        contexts substantially, so as to give body to an occluded and shadowy 
        counterworld of significance that ordinary criticism, even sympathetic 
        criticism, treats with some distance and abstraction, in acceptable theoretical 
        fashion. Collecott, in other words, takes risks in both her critical focus 
        and in her mode of procedure: but the risks are absolutely in keeping 
        with the matter she explores in the book.</font></p>
