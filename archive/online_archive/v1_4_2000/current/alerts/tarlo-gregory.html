On the         other hand, the book itself is an imaginative creative exercise in reading,         a process Collecott is clearly fascinated by. Not only reading however:         Collecott's work becomes its own signifying process as she writes herself         into and through the key images, words and even letters that recur in         H.D.'s texts and intertexts. It is not surprising that she often quotes         from Susan Howe's <i>My Emily Dickinson</i> since, at times, her own process         of engagement with her subject attains a similar creative intensity.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Through         these critical and creative processes, Collecott teases out, to use her         own phrase, that most elusive of qualities, a poet's sensibility. What         I find most exciting here is how, throughout this process, H.D.'s texts         retain and are reinforced in their specificity: their individual flowers,         colours and qualities of light. Some of the most evocative readings are         those of H.D.'s topography, the islands, beaches and crossroads that recur         as key distinctive elements in her work. Yet, at the same time this book         is about a tradition or a community of writing. The textual space Collecott         explores here is also clearly related to its cultural contexts, particularly         to the silencing and subsequent signifying of marginalised groups, particularly         women-identified women. Here Collecott, wearing her learning lightly,         draws her threads out through history from H.D. to Sappho to Swinburne         to Shakespeare, whilst drawing detailed comparisons between H.D. and her         modernist counterparts and H.D. and her poetic inheritors. The wide range         of reference is kept in clear focus: a sense of writing in its own time         and place is intrinsic to the volume and, throughout, Collecott retains         a strong sense of H.D.'s own time as well as the history of her reception         as a writer. It is Sappho however, whose writing and whose existence as         a powerful imaginative construct for H.D. and for many others, to whom         Collecott keeps returning and it is the Sapphic in H.D.'s poetics and         sexual politics which gives her book its clarity and power.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>—Harriet         Tarlo</b></font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         importance of H.D. and Sapphic Modernism is in laying open, laying bare,         many dimensions of H.D.'s &quot;Sapphic&quot; intertextuality: not simply         her complex engagement with Sappho's poetry itself and its literary permutations,         but, perhaps more importantly, the profound cultural, political, and artistic         implications of &quot;Sapphism&quot; in the early twentieth century. This         latter task entails the recovery of an intricate and dense network of         women writers whose literary project and whose whole conception of intellectual         exchange was distinct from the climate of early modernism and its male         collaborators. This task also compels a engagement with a fraught and         difficult theoretical territory concerning gender and sexuality, issues         which Collecott negotiates with steadiness and clarity. Having persuasively         established the centrality of this Sapphic project for H.D., she then         gives a reading of the early career, showing the way in which H.D. situates         herself in resistance to the contemporary critical programs that in large         part determined her reputation. Thus Collecott prepares the way in the         final chapters for the articulation of a lesbian poetics in the context         of H.D.'s writing and for a brilliant exploration of H.D.'s negotiation         of the tradition in her rereading of Shakespeare in light of an alternate,         homoerotic tradition.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         individual chapters are quite persuasive in defining a cultural and literary         territory of Sapphism in modern literature that otherwise is largely obscured         in critical treatments. Many critics have preceded Collecott in giving         primacy to Sappho as a precursor in H.D.'s poetry, and excellent studies         by Friedman, DuPlessis, Koepfler, Laity, and others give due weight to         H.D.'s lesbian relationships, especially to her relationships with Frances         Gregg and Bryher, and to the implications of her bisexuality in her writing,         both before and after her crucial analysis with Freud. Collecott acknowledges         and benefits from this work. However, with regard to Sappho, her claim,         substantiated by argument, is radical: that Sappho is to H.D. what Dante         is to Eliot, or Homer to Pound. Moreover, her study represents, with regard         to the issue of H.D.'s sexuality, a different kind of critical effort.         Collecott's writing enacts in its own way the difficulties that she finds         in H.D.'s lesbian poetics, the obliquity and displacement in attempting         to say what is unsayable. Thus, the argument in individual chapters does         not proceed in a linear fashion; rather it works by the accretion of overlays.         Each chapter gathers up intricate sets of associations, from ancient and         modern literature, from H.D.'s life and writing and from those of her         associates and contemporaries, and from nineteenth- and twentieth-century         cultural contexts. This mode represents an effort to amplify these many         contexts substantially, so as to give body to an occluded and shadowy         counterworld of significance that ordinary criticism, even sympathetic         criticism, treats with some distance and abstraction, in acceptable theoretical         fashion. Collecott, in other words, takes risks in both her critical focus         and in her mode of procedure: but the risks are absolutely in keeping         with the matter she explores in the book.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>—Eileen         Gregory</b></font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="index.html">alerts</a>         </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="../index.html">table         of contents</a> </font></p>      <hr>      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </td>  </tr>    <tr>     <td width="86" height="1" valign="top"><img width="86" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="14" height="1" valign="top"><img width="14" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="1" height="1" valign="top"><img width="1" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="17" height="1" valign="top"><img width="17" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
