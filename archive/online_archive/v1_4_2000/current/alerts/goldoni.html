        For a long time Susan Glaspell has been known only for her one-act play 
        <i>Trifles</i> (1916), and it is easy to understand why: the written text 
        is very short, just the right size for inclusion in an anthology; it is 
        well-made, realistic, and, as such, ready for reading, imagining and performing.  
        Few actors are required to stage it and the scene is fixed and simple: 
        a gloomy kitchen, abandoned without having been put in order.  On curtain 
        rising the drama&#8217;s already done: John and Minnie Wright, the owners of 
        the farm which provides the setting, are not there; the husband has been 
        killed, strangled in his bed; the wife is suspected but without proof.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Trifles</i> 
        is a detective play in the form of a dyptich, in which three men are moving 
        around the house: the sheriff, a neighbor, the county attorney who, looking 
        for evidence, search everywhere, go upstairs to the bedroom, outside to 
        the barn, cross the kitchen several times just to notice the unsettled 
        room and interpret it as a mark of bad housewifery. The other side of 
        the dyptich is made up by the sheriff&#8217;s wife and the neighbor&#8217;s wife, 
        who keep to the kitchen: they hesitate at first to break the intimacy 
        of Minnie&#8217;s place, but then look around carefully, read through the objects 
        and the unfinished work: the table half-cleaned, the bread uncovered, 
        a bird-cage with a broken hinge, recent stitching on the patchwork quilt 
        irregular and untidy.  The women recognize in those trifles (as the men 
        call them) the signs of a deep trouble, anger perhaps.  While trying to 
        repair the quilt, they find the dead bird in the sewing box: &quot;Somebody 
        wrung its neck.&quot;  That&#8217;s all they say; they do not dare to explicate 
        the reconstruction they&#8217;ve made of the cause-effect chain which has resulted 
        in the murder.  Tacitly, they decide to hide the clues.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Trifles</i> 
        is a drama of absence, of negation and suffocation to the last, since 
        even Minnie&#8217;s final escape from eviction thanks to the women&#8217;s judgement. 
        &#8220;A Jury of Her Peers&#8221; (the title of a short story Glaspell developed from 
        the play in 1917) is realized and expressed through the women not saying 
        and the men not seeing. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Glaspell 
        had a very important role in the making of the new American theater, both 
        as a playwright and as a co-founder of the Provincetown Players. Far from 
        being a solitary flower, <i>Trifles</i> is one among many plays and novels 
        the author wrote, helped to produce and at times performed.  A few years 
        later, Glaspell wrote The <i>Verge</i> (1921), a controversial, complicated 
        and difficult work, dishomogeneous and aesthetically imperfect, yet daring 
        and memorable. The title itself tells of a push towards extreme boundary: 
        verge, more than edge (a distinction which also occurs in the play through 
        dialogue and proper names) is suggestive of a dangerous threshold between 
        two different states positioned at separate spatial levels.  The protagonist, 
        Claire Archer, is kin to many Faustian heroes of romanticism. Most of 
        all she is close to Hawthorne&#8217;s Rapaccini, since both cultivate plants 
        endowed with a supreme vital energy.  In Hawthorne&#8217;s tale, Dr. Rapaccini 
        is a talented and damnable scientist who&#8217;s trying to defy God and to force 
        nature into creating hybrid, artifical forms, the monstrous off-spring 
        of man&#8217;s depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty.  
        Rapaccini employs her daughter Beatrice (whose name is reminiscent of 
        Beatrice Cenci rather than of Dante&#8217;s Beatrice) to allure men and poison 
        them with the venom she has unknowingly absorbed from breath of life, 
        the plant of plants her father has created. Breath of life runs from Rapaccini 
        to Claire, from Hawthorne to Glaspell: in both cases the flower works 
        as an emblem of feminine creativity and sexuality, which are perverted 
        in Rapaccini&#8217;s intentions in order to produce death instead of life; while 
        in Claire&#8217;s view the experiment is meant as the equivalent of a liberation 
        from social imprints. The partial coincidence between the two texts is 
        not an occasional borrowing, but a necessity internal to the theme: breath 
        of life is an icon of creation, be it divine or aesthetic.</font> 
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many 
        Fausts of the romantic tradition do challenge nature (just think of Melville&#8217;s 
        Ahab), or even try to outdo it and to generate creatures out of art or 
        science so as to appropriate for themselves the feminine role (Shelley&#8217;s 
        Frankestein), but both Rapaccini and Claire create from within nature.  
        In the passage from one historical context to another, from one literary 
        genre to another, and more relevant, from one gender to another, Glaspell 
        has retained the essential Faustian feature, the determination to trespass 
        human limits; however, as a modern Faust, Claire Archer has rejected all 
        alliances with a diabolic nature; science is to her, rather, a sort of 
        magic metaphor, enabling one to open the  doors of a new spirituality.</font>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>The 
        Verge</i> sounds at the start like a domestic comedy, presenting one out 
        of many occasions in which a married couple comes to friction on small 
        matters.  Here the object of contention is the plants,  though a more 
        substantial problem seems to emerge from the presence of Claire&#8217;s lover, 
        who is also by the way her husband&#8217;s friend.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Gardening 
        has always been regarded as a very appropriate activity for women, because 
        it provides beauty to the house and enhances gentle behavior.  Claire 
        has reversed the usual hierarchy between plants and mankind: she takes 
        warmth away from men in order to keep the greenhouse warm, and worse: 
        she keeps men away from the place because they disturb the delicate atmospheric 
        balance required by her plants.  She doesn&#8217;t cultivate flowers to adorn 
        her husband&#8217;s table as in the genteel tradition, but is a scientist, experimenting 
        on hybrids. Her project is of a symbolic nature, because she&#8217;s trying 
        to find the way out from given structures/strictures: We need not to be 
        held in forms moulded for us.  There is outness and otherness.  She&#8217;s 
        experimenting on plants, because with them what she is looking at is already 
        happening: Plants do it.  The big leap it&#8217;s called.  Explode their species 
        because something in them knows they&#8217;ve gone as far as they can go.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If 
        Claire is always center stage, there are a number of other characters 
        whose degree of daring never reaches the point of getting out from their 
        old, given forms.  The excess of relationships and the transgressive nature 
        of some of them, from a social point-of-view, is nonetheless anchored 
        to a common focus&#8212;love and eros&#8212;so that we have a husband, a lover, a 
        beloved, plus an unloved daughter given over to a conformist aunt.  More 
        than Claire&#8217;s erotic transgressions, her refusal to love her daughter, 
        her outright repulsion, are the real taboos Glaspell breaks in this play.  
        You can pull down all sorts of beliefs, but not motherly love; that&#8217;s 
        unconceivable even in fables, where cruel or oppressive mothers are turned 
        into witches or step-mothers.  In <i>The Verge</i>, the words pronounced 
        by Claire in front of Elizabeth are irretrievable and shocking, especially 
        since they abjure the original physical unity between them: &#8220;To think 
        that object ever moved my belly and sucked my breast!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Among 
        the men surrounding Claire, the only one who is close to her in his being 
        a &#8220;quester,&#8221; is her beloved Tom Edgeworthy, who for a good portion of 
        the drama functions as Claire&#8217;s second voice.  He too is in search of 
        non-conformity and of a language of truth.  The author gives both, Tom 
        and Claire, the same words: &#8220;Things are not what is said about things&#8221;;&#8220;The 
        only thing worth saying is the thing we can&#8217;t say&#8221;.  But even Tom is disappointing 
        and eventually goes back to his old, conventional way of being.  His surname, 
        Edgeworthy, makes him a replica (and vice-versa) of &#8220;Edge Vine,&#8221; Claire&#8217;s 
        first experiment in plants.  Human beings and plants are here of a same 
        pattern: following &#8220;Edge Vine&#8221; back to the usual forms, we follow Tom, 
        and even Claire&#8217;s daughter (&#8220;&#8212;it isn&#8217;t over the edge.  It&#8217;s running back 
        to &#8216;all the girls&#8217;&#8221;).  Tom&#8217;s proposal is of romantic love; Claire&#8217;s rejection 
        of it is, if possible, even more shocking than her rejection of motherhood: 
        love, the first and last drive and duty of woman&#8217;s life is here utterly 
        denied, itself a form of suffocation,&#8212;however attractive and seemingly 
        fulfilling.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is not surprising then, that all threads come together at the end of the 
        play, while Claire is waiting for the supreme flower, &#8220;Breath of Life,&#8221; 
        to blossom.  Tom&#8217;s offer is clearly posed as a going back to worn out 
        <i>topoi</i>, as an embrace which will emprison all desire:</font></p>

        last gesture is that of enclosing Tom into that embrace unto death; in 
        so doing she also kills that residual part of herself which had kept her 
        in touch with the world.  It&#8217;s here that while Claire&#8217;s mind is opening

        appears as an extreme, paradoxical character.  For her author, Glaspell, 
        she is an experiment, somehow the same way her plants are an experiment 
        for her. Alhough Claire is not alone when compared with the heroines of 
        Ibsen, Wedekind, Nietzsche, O&#8217;Neill, and with the as yet half sketched 
        figures of tragic extravagance drawn by Djuna Barnes, it is evident how 
        Glaspell doesn&#8217;t mean to create a prototype, but a unique speciman. The 
        explosion/implosion of forms, the apocalyptic imagination, are common 
        features of early 20th century avant-gardes.They announce with terror 
        and hope the disintegration of Victorian certitudes and turn to the expressionistic 
        disarticulated howl, to Gordon Craig&#8217;s &Uuml;ber-marionette, to violence in 
        colors and words.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2 align=left style='text-align:left;'><p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        this instance, the author unfolds very carefully the passage from utopia 
        to madness, from Claire&#8217;s dream of regeneration to her consciousness of 
        the fatal cyclical reproduction of forms given.  The blossoming of Breath 
        of Life is neither magic nor contagious enough to extend <i>outness</i> 
        and <i>otherness</i> to her creator and to historical reality.  As a work 
        of art, <i>The Verge</i> is partly a failure: too often melodrama is awkwardly 
        lurking; the gap between drawing-room conversation and the meditation 
        upon the absolute is too exhibited.  Yet, failure is an inherent part 
        of Claire&#8217;s tragedy: thematic solidarity between different modes of communication 
        is of unusual intensity&#8212;the verbal and the non verbal concur in telling 
        a search for form which is strongly ideological. The expressionistic stage 
        design presents a twisted staircase coming form under, a glass case separating 
        the greenhouse from the main stage (and making visible the fourth wall), 
        the broken circle designed by Claire as perimeter of her room&#8212;all are 
        outcomes of Claire&#8217;s tortured psyche, in which her energy, too long repressed, 
        explodes in disintegration.</font></p>
