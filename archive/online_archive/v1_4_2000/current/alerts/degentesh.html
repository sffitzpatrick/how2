      in Brooklyn</i>: Poems by Joanna Fuhrman</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><br>
     <font size="3">July 2000, Hanging Loose Press,

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#8220;Self-consciousness&#8221; 
        is a strange phrase of Americanese, one that can serve as reference to 
        someone&#8217;s worst hang-ups or to his or her best qualities. There&#8217;s the 
        typical sentence, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to talk to her; I was too self-conscious&#8221; 
        -- and then there&#8217;s the &#8220;heightened sense of self-consciousness&#8221; that 
        stars in the blurbs of so many book jackets.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writers 
        who can play to both sides of this coin may be rare, but it would seem 
        that Joanna Fuhrman is such a writer. Her first collection of poems,<i> 
        Freud in Brooklyn</i>, is a collection that&#8217;s simultaneously introspective 
        and entertaining, and exhibits a voice that&#8217;s equally at home in silly 
        tones or honest, serious ones.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        book begins with a section in which the poet keeps herself pretty much 
        &#8220;Out of the Picture.&#8221; The only &#8220;us&#8221; here belongs to a bunch of brains 
        hanging around &#8220;swapping chordates&#8221; by  the five and dime, and the few 
        &#8220;I&#8217;s  and &#8220;we&#8217;s belong mainly to germs and dreamers. Ms. Fuhrman has a 
        talent for narration, and displays it well, particularly in the title 
        poem, which features a Freud who travels to Brooklyn to see Coney Island&#8217;s 
        Dreamland Park just as it starts to burn. But my favorite line from this 
        section comes from the fragmented &#8220;Blue Poem #6&#8221;:  &#8220;Some words are heavier 
        than others. Try carrying <i>it.</i>&#8221;</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Poking 
        fun at Yiddish in &#8220;Shticking with the Shtotics,&#8221; the second section of 
        the book, the poet tackles the subjects of family and Jewishness with 
        humor. Even her descriptions of a grandmother&#8217;s funeral in &#8220;Afterimage&#8221; 
        carry honest, funny details: &#8220;The rest just watch each other to see who 
        is crying, who is looking / at the ground, what kinds of shoes you can 
        wear with black.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        me, most of the book&#8217;s gems are seeded in the book&#8217;s final section, &#8220;Personal 
        Ad,&#8221; which contains many of the most personal and the most experimental 
        pieces, mainly in the form of uniquely hilarious love poems that manage 
        to conflate love and art or love and nature as freshly as they do love 
        and vegetables. &#8220;You could have been more / than the egg in the tempera. 
        / O you, who will always be a you,&#8221; mourns the speaker in &#8220;A History of 
        Western Art.&#8221; Ms. Fuhrman is at her funniest and most inventive in these 
        poems. Freud reappears, if only inferentially, in the opening lines of 
        &#8220;Window as Camouflage&#8221;: </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thus 
        begins a poem about subtext which itself carries a subtext -- and yet 
        somehow manages to keep from being either obscure or facetious. The result 
        is a charming, teasingly obvious yet inventive verbal dexterity, wielded 
        by a poet who is very much her own person, and knows it.</font></p>
