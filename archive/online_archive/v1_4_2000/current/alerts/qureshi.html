The words of the         Tao are very much ancestral to those of Hejinian's <i>Happily</i>, a text         which seems to rub off all the mystifying dross and ornament of theory         and reveal the glitter of the true nature of the lozenge of art, whose         value she neither demeans nor exaggerates.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Happily</i>         is very much a continuation of Hejinian's earlier works, fusing the concerns         of what &quot;Writing&quot; and &quot;Aid to Memory&quot; is to her in         her &quot;Life.&quot; &quot;Constantly I write this happily,&quot; begins         Hejinian. Beginning self-reflexively, beginning with self-consciousness         of her own activity, beginning with a note of permanence, beginning with         description of a state: she writes &quot;happily.&quot; But what is it         to work at her text &quot;happily&quot;? &quot;Is happiness the name for         our (involuntary) complicity with chance?&quot; she will soon query. &quot;Complicity&quot;         is a very Taoist idea, the acceptance of the dealings of necessity: &quot;'Welcome         disgrace as a pleasant surprise. Prize calamities as your own body....'         Because our body is the very source of our calamaties. If we have no body,         what calamities can we have?&quot; (13) Calamity is a reminder, for Lao         Tzu, of the consciousness of the body; this is not the Christian acceptance         of suffering but rather its opposite—a radical acceptance of bodily consciousness         as opposed to its abnegation—not a recommendation of suffering, but an         acknowledgement of its existence. &quot;To be one with Loss is to be a         welcome accession to Loss&quot; (23), Tzu writes, not celebrating loss,         but advocating being &quot;one&quot; with it, organic wholeness with nature's         patterns.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Harmony         with nature's patterns is very much a part of Hejinian's work, not new         to <i>Happily</i>, and is revealed by her resourcefulness of imagery,         a resort to nature indicating an acceptance of the ways of the world,         a realism which is not one, limited by art. As she writes in <i>The Cold         of Poetry</i>, &quot;Realism is an unimaginable ballad: direct speech/across         the trajectory of nature in its tress/ Which word in an object of imitation?&quot;         It is the disjunction between sign and referent of which all Language         Poets are aware that prevents Hejinian from calling herself a realist,         so her realism is a formal one, defamiliarized in the world of signs in         which Hejinian reports to be so happy:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here         I write with inexact straightness but into a place in place<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">immediately         passing between phrases of the imagination<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Flowers         optimistically going to seed, fluttering candles lapping<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the         air, persevering saws swimming into boards, buckets<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">taking         dents, and the hands on the clock turning - they<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">arn't         melancholy</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As         Hejinian writes she writes with reference to an imagery of a nature evolving         &quot;optimistically,&quot; without pathetic fallacy imposing a tragic         sense of &quot;melancholy&quot; projected unto history. </font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What         is a slip of the tongue in quickening tempo over itself the<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">busy         world seeking out a given time interval or probing<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">it<br>        </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Suddenly         it encounters a wind, an onion, a reason</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">wonders         Hejinian.

'the principle of motion and energeia'.&quot;         (<i>Physics</i>, III, 1). Necessity, with which Hejinian must comply in         her energeia of writing fits into nature's scheme as a factor whose &quot;actuality         is in nature&quot; as Aristotle writes in <i>On Interpretation</i>. Writes         Hejinian in <i>The Cold of Poetry</i>, &quot;Put tongue to foot and say         necessity.&quot; For Aristotle, time is indespensible to nature; if nature         involves &quot;motion,&quot; &quot;Time is the measure of motion&quot;         (<i>Physics</i>, IV, 12).</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hejinian         understands the need to meditate on time in her activity of writing:</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One         might look at the clock and see hands turning in the air in<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">a         room quiet only in anticipation of some secret satisfac-<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">tion         that time cannot bring as a bell to a boat or a trope<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">to         the image in thought of a person in real or this life or<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the         thought of an image or of an iceberg green in vernal<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">half-light.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Writing,         the &quot;trope,&quot;satisfies in harmony with the image of the natural         image of the &quot;iceberg&quot; as an ersatz for time, a parallel nature         which is horizontal not vertical. Of course &quot;It is hard to explain         time&quot; but it is &quot;the sense of senses&quot; essential to the         activity of writing, and Hejinian quite bluntly suggests, &quot;Perhaps         it is the role of art to put us in complicity with things as they happen.&quot;</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And         that would be happiness for Hejinian. Is this right-wing? A conservative         acceptance of things as they are rather than the oppositional possibilities         of art, possibilities embodied in Language Poetry origins in its resistance         to the Vietnam War? This is the sort of scenario that leads Adorno to         ponder art's &quot;right to exist&quot; in Aesthetic Theory. &quot;[T]he         whole of modern art can be understood as the perpetual intervention of         the subject,&quot; writes Adorno—Hejinian's reminder that she is constantly         writing happily, but &quot;the permanent interventions of the ego are         matched by a tendency of the ego to abdicate&quot; for Adorno, in Hejinian's         case to become a universal subject writing for all writers in harmony         with nature and exhorting art's purposes for happiness. Hejinian understands         that art is not really autnomous to society, as Adorno would have it,         &quot;a bourgeois consciousness of freedom that was itself bound up in         the social structure;&quot; its modern &quot;autonomy&quot; is moot as         Hejinian understands it; for her, it is the work of a producing single         (in the case of writing; the same would not apply to say, cinema) social         subject, hence the real aporia would not be between whether art could         &quot;negate society&quot; as Adorno famously stated it always does, but         how the individual subject represents the universal and particular, a         political concern expressed in such <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> essays as Brian         Fawcett's &quot;Agent of Language,&quot; in which Fawcett wonders from         which class writing comes. For Hejinian, the universal and particular         are synthesized in the promise of happiness that writing brings to her,         and to anyone who writes: &quot; 'unhappiness through art'/ its own irreducible         deformation&quot; she declares in the Cold of Poetry.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For         her politics we will not have to turn to the debates of opposition through         say form versus content represented by Adorno and Lukacs. Hejinian is         not about an oppositional nature of art but understanding that &quot;works         of art normally replicate simply by virtue of their own existence... the         inadequacy of the aesthetic itself,&quot; as Adorno said in his centennial         lecture on Mahler. But in Hejinian's replication, in the felicitous rearrangement         of signs, there is a progressive utopian vision, and this can only be         reminiscent of Bloch. Bloch looks at art with &quot;the most important         concern of Marxism, namely, the changing of the world&quot; in mind, in         his essay &quot;Art and Society.&quot; For Bloch, the &quot;pure aesthetics         of contemplation&quot; whose locus is Kant's third Critique is an acceptance         of the debased real, an acceptance of the world as it is which is not         the world as it should be, and what is needed is &quot;the landscape of         hope,&quot; a utopian impulse, an &quot;anticipatory illumination.&quot;         Herein lies the progressiveness of Hejinian's happiness, for hers is a         complicity with &quot;anticipatory illumination.&quot; Her first line         may be &quot;Constantly I write happily,&quot; but her second is &quot;Hazards         that hope may break open my lips:&quot; it is hope, &quot;the dream forward,&quot;         as Bloch puts it, that causes Hejinian's lips to open, that causes her         to utter so happily. Hence when Hejinian can write</font></p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Imagining         ourselves under a gray sky shining so brightly our<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">eyes         can't establish any connections, a sky so bright that<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the         option of connection isn't open, this puts in mind<br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">of         beginnings that reason can motivate but not end</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">we         sense, as Bloch puts it in &quot;Art and Utopia,&quot; &quot;a world that         would be totally unchangeable without the enormous future, the real possibilities         within it,&quot; the &quot;possibilities&quot; represented in the &quot;anticipatory         illumination&quot; of a gray sky which shines so brightly, a defiance         of a gloomy world, a defiance where it is possible to imagine a future         where even gray skies shine bright, suggesting the possibilities of progress,         that can begin to tease us out of thought, accomplished through a social         construction: language.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which         is why Hejinian's art happiness is not one of mere complicity with whatever         might be going wrong with the world, be it social injustice or ecological         destruction. It is the wisdom of the Lao Tzu synthesized with the hope         of Bloch. Art, for Hejinian, brings us into harmony with nature without         abandoning a utopian social impulse. Near the end of <i>Happily</i>, Hejinian         employs her title word one last time: &quot;No, happily I'm feeling the         wind in its own right rather than as of particular pertinence to us at         a windy moment.&quot; In this dissent from Hegel, whose phenomonological         project could only be solved with the world existed for us, Hejinian recognizes         nature on &quot;its own right.&quot; Through Art, the wind itself, necessity,         which need not include the injustices of our world, and which for Marx         included revolution, is acknowledged.</font></p>      <hr>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>BIO</b>:       Ramez Qureshi is currently working toward an MFA at Otis College of Arts       and Design, where he also teaches critical analysis and semiotics.
