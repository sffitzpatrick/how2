While it may be         odd to begin a discussion of Jean Valentine's recent volume of poems <i>The</i>         <i>Cradle of the Real Life</i> with a clip from Allen, whose comic-neurotic         sensibility seems, at first, far afield from these moving poems. Valentine's         work has always concerned itself with the real conversation. In her latest         book, she does this in a section called Her Lost Book, by giving us         just enough of the apparent conversation or statements to lead us to read         what, by implication, by the very body language of her poems, is really         being said.

The separation of &quot;meanwhile&quot; into &quot;mean while&quot;         is not simply idiosyncratic.

In &quot;November&quot; the speaker, leaving         her home and her marriage, speaks of the two mountains shrinking in the         distance landscape as &quot;female and male/ walking down the stairs/         into the ground.&quot; The poem ends with the pronouncement:</font></p>      <table width="507" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td width="111">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="396">             <p ><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I               have to leave<br>              </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">and               I have to watch.</font></p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There         is a strange reciprocity expressed here, the dark side perhaps of &quot;I         drink from you/you drink from me.&quot; It is the lover-as-writer, the         woman-as-writer whose experiences are necessarily attended by that Inner         Record-keeper, Note-taker, but it is also the duality of action and feeling.         The speaker is not leaving joyfully, so the act of leaving is the opposite         in some sense of what she desires, what her heart is pulled toward. This         is why she has to watch, to be outside herself at the same time as she         is mourning deeply.
