        Woody Allen's 1977 movie, &#8220;Annie Hall&#8221;, there is a scene where the two 
        potential lovers Annie (Diane Keaton) and Alvie (Woody Allen) engage in 
        a general conversation while, on the screen, appearing as subtitles is 
        the <i>real</i> but unspoken text of the conversation. While it may be 
        odd to begin a discussion of Jean Valentine's recent volume of poems <i>The</i> 
        <i>Cradle of the Real Life</i> with a clip from Allen, whose comic-neurotic 
        sensibility seems, at first, far afield from these moving poems. Valentine's 
        work has always concerned itself with the real conversation. In her latest 
        book, she does this in a section called &#8220;Her Lost Book,&#8221; by giving us 
        just enough of the apparent conversation or statements to lead us to read 
        what, by implication, by the very body language of her poems, is really 
        being said. In a series of poems involving a couple's therapy:</font></p>

        this brief archaeology of the place that language is, the poet leads us

        the Public Library&quot; where a woman is reading to several others the 
        story of the Triangle Shirt Factory fire. Just at the point in the story 
        where the factory women discover the doors are locked and there's no escape, 
        the librarian &quot;says she has to stop/it's time for him to close. He 
        closes.&quot; As the speaker explains to a male acquaintance in &quot;He 
        Says to Me, In Ireland,&quot; she wants &quot;those women's lives/rage  
        constraints/the poems they burned&#8212;The History/ of the World without Words.&quot; 
        It is a world of denials, the nun's abuse of the girls at an orphanage 
        ignored by the local doctor, the women in prison practicing Beauty Care 
        on mannequins, the world of a personal depression so bewildering:</font></p>

        things are remarkable here&#8212;Valentine's music, her ability to move in open-ended 
        phrases but keep &quot;stepping lively,&quot; the imagery of the pen as 
        a lizard on the road, the greenness of it as a &quot;little light&quot; 
        and tracing its movement, transforming into &quot;gourd&quot;, &quot;thought&quot; 
        lying on thought, bow &quot;not moving/ held.&quot; In it we see the act 
        of writing itself as part of the natural world of animal, water, wind, 
        light &amp; the mysterious stirrings of language which comes up from the 
        unconscious &quot;gourd I drink from in my sleep,&quot; and which also 
        &quot;drinks from me.&quot; This is the nurturing, the cradling of language 
        which we put our selves into and draw ourselves from as well. The imagery 
        here is of the small (two-inch lizard), the often insubstantial, mist, 
        sleep, light, thought and finally, a canny reversal. The music here comes 
        not by drawing the bow across the strings of the instrument but by letting 
        it lie across, be held. The active and the passive are married in this 
        closing image. Part of the erotics of writing here is the awareness of 
        &quot;otherness,&quot; and the awareness that waiting and listening (what 
        we often consider passive) is at the heart of it. </font></p>

        we see the daughter's investment in language still encountering her father's 
        lack of investment in it. Her &quot;retreat&quot; into language is survival 
        but here the implication is that from her father's point of view &quot;words&quot; 
        are less than &quot;actions.&quot; There's a dismissal here that is sad 
        and ironic because the poem ends in that brief dialogue, language the 
        only sign of life still between them. It is the voice, too, of &quot;the 
        real life,&quot; the place of connectedness in spite of damage, in spite

        to be so. The separation of &quot;meanwhile&quot; into &quot;mean while&quot; 
        is not simply idiosyncratic. It not only literally gives us pause, but 
        emphasizes the simplicity of the speaker; the poem is entirely monosyllabic

        her work so absorbing. It is not afraid of mystery. Nothing in this poem 
        is &quot;unclear&quot;&#8212;it's perfectly clear what is being said. I have 
        visions of my eighth grade English teacher fretting and sweating the class 
        over what the &quot;black straw&quot; is. I don't think, however, it's 
        something to &quot;translate.&quot; In context it is what it needs to 
        be, the reader senses it&#8212;there's the darkness of it, the drawing out, 
        the delicacy of it, the implications of &quot;drinking&quot; (being nourished), 
        and of something being released from the body. At the end of another poem

        her home and her marriage, speaks of the two mountains shrinking in the 
        distance landscape as &quot;female and male/ walking down the stairs/

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
        is a strange reciprocity expressed here, the dark side perhaps of &quot;I 
        drink from you/you drink from me.&quot; It is the lover-as-writer, the 
        woman-as-writer whose experiences are necessarily attended by that Inner 
        Record-keeper, Note-taker, but it is also the duality of action and feeling. 
        The speaker is not leaving joyfully, so the act of leaving is the opposite 
        in some sense of what she desires, what her heart is pulled toward. This 
        is why she has to watch, to be outside herself at the same time as she 
        is mourning deeply. To record the leaving would not be the story of a 
        &quot;real life.&quot; the watching and the necessity of doing so is also 
        the story. &quot;No deception penetrates here,&quot; states the epigraph 
        to the book from Martin Buber,&quot; here is the cradle of the Real Life.&quot;</font></p>
