        The underside of the tapestry</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>In the first part of this study (<i>HOW2</i>, 
        no. 2/ September, 1999), I synthetically told the story of the <i>The 
        Freewoman</i>&#8217;s transformation into <i>The New Freewoman </i>and <i>The 
        Egoist.</i> There<i> </i>I promised I would provide &#8220;a short analysis 
        of the last change of title and expand on  the relation between Marsden, 
        Pound and H.D., respectively editor of and contributors to <i>The New 
        Freewoman</i>, on divergent aesthetic projects,  and the directions the 
        debate over the new in art could have taken if Pound had not dominated 
        the scene.&quot;</p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        typical story of modernist criticism<i> </i>runs as a narrative texture 
        where all threads combine to design the figures of Pound, Eliot and Joyce 
        as emblematic of Anglo-American literary innovation. This story also runs 
        through many antagonistic narratives, where other figures&#8212;of women and 
        minority groups&#8212;are added, crowding the space and certainly reorganizing 
        the way it is perceived, but substantially following traditional storylines. 
        The reading I propose&#8212;which is also the guiding line of our group&#8217;s research 
        project&#8212;shall, instead, retrace the threads, and the knots, that can be 
        seen in the underside of the cloth, and reconstruct the cultural discourses 
        contributing to form the design in the tapestry. From this perspective, 
        we can notice the way differently colored threads are joined, how they 
        cross the warp, telling of breaks and changes woven into the length of 
        the linear warp of time. Unseen on the surface, they draw a different 
        picture of those figures, they may even blur them and reveal not so much 
        their uniqueness as the way they are interwoven with other figures.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        its last issue, of 12 October 1912, <i>The Freewoman</i> carried an appeal 
        for support. Though only a few subscribers answered, Marsden, spurred 
        by Rebecca West, decided to re-start the journal. As Marsden herself wrote 
        in the issue of November 1913, the &#8220;&#8216;emotional push&#8217; which &#8220;landed <i>The 
        New Freewoman</i> on its feet came from a tiny group of American women&#8221; 
        (among them the writers Lucian Cary and Edna Kenton)<a href="camboni.html#edn1">[1]</a> 
        <a name="back1"></a><i>The Freewoman</i>&#8217;s subscribers and supporters 
        in Chicago and New York were very much interested in the paper&#8217;s pioneering 
        work. It was their interest that continued to nourish its connection to 
        feminism, and even the continuation of the title:</font></p>

              to give it expression worth while, hung on the energies of those

              the &#8216;American&#8217; enthusiasm had its effect: with the result that this 
              new journal came into being earlier than it otherwise would, and 
              with the same differentiation as to gender in its title as the earlier

        Dell, the Editor of the &#8220;Friday Literary Review&#8221; of the <i>Chicago Evening 
        Post</i>, even devoted a whole chapter to Dora Marsden in his<i> Women 
        as World Builders</i>, of 1913, where he defined her as the &#8220;Max Stirner 
        of feminism&#8221;. The American supporters&#8217; effort to set up a &#8220;Thousand Club&#8221; 
        to secure a sound financial basis was met by Marsden with a similar attempt 
        in her own country. Together with Harriet Shaw Weaver, she began a British 
        Thousand Club. In early 1913 a circular written by Rebecca West but forwarding 
        Marsden&#8217;s point of view, announced the publication of <i>The New Freewoman. 
        </i>Differently from its predecessor, this paper<i> </i>was to move beyond 
        its insular bounds and have a transatlantic scope, addressing both British 
        and American readers. It wanted also to go beyond feminism and spread 
        its individualist philosophy of modernist movements, which applied to 
        men as well as to women:</font></p>

              all that is most significant in modern movements including feminism.

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt;'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the editorial of the first issue, and in the &#8220;Views and Comments&#8221; section 
        that follows, Marsden illustrates her new &#8220;individualist&#8221; version of the 
        &#8220;freewoman&#8221;, clearly inspired by Max Stirner&#8217;s anarchism. Marsden&#8217;s own 
        words seem literally taken from the opening chapter of his <i>Ego and 
        its Own</i>, a book originally published in Germany in 1844 (and criticised 
        by Karl Marx in his <i>German Ideology</i>)<i> </i>that had become fashionable 
        among the Anglo American anarchist circles in the 1890s and 1900s.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        in the first editorial of <i>The Freewoman</i>, and coherent with Marsden&#8217;s 
        antagonistic logic, the rhetorical construction of the text hinges on 
        the antithesis of &#8220;lean&#8221; and &#8220;fat&#8221;: a metaphor which is also emblematic 
        of the moral jurisdiction every human being has over her/his own body 
        in Stirner&#8217;s, and Marsden&#8217;s, philosophy.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#8220;Lean&#8221; 
        are all those who have become &#8220;selfless&#8221; by devoting themselves to a &#8220;cause&#8221;, 
        first of all the poor , and who have devoted themselves to the cause of 
        honesty. The State, however, champions the interests of the &#8220;fat&#8221;, i.e., 
        of those who have money and property even though it relies on the &#8220;lean&#8221; 
        for support. As a consequence: &#8220;There is only one thing the down-trodden 
        with retained dignity can do and that is to Get Up. And there is only 
        one thing for the lean and that is, to get fat, get property: and it is 
        the one thing they will not do&#8221;. And yet, the only solution to such a 
        predicament for Marsden is not to wait on God&#8217;s or society&#8217;s help or to 
        organize according to political, social or, class interests but &#8220;what 
        a man <i>wants doing</i>, he will do himself.&#8221; (<i>The New Freewoman, 
        &#8220;The</i> Lean Kind&#8221;, I:1, 1913, p. 2)</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        Marsden property must be in a constant flux. Coherently, she invites the 
        &#8220;lean&#8221; to go out and get the &#8220;things&#8221; they need. In so doing, they will 
        be acting for their own benefit, and not for an abstract Cause.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the &#8220;View and Comments&#8221; following the editorial, Marsden further explains 
        what she deems ideological, empty words, through the example of the Suffragist 
        Cause, Mrs. Pankhurst and her fight for &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Freedom&#8221;.</font></p>

            free&#8217;. A Definite action, therefore, with a positive beginning and 
            a definable end: limited in time and complete in its operation. There 
            exists nothing in this which explains the vague unending thing called 
            freedom. ...which carries on an independent existence on its own account.

        By opposing verb and noun Marsden once again attributes a positive value

        and a negative one to concept, which she believes is a bodiless, static 
        mental contemplation of something that has no reality. This is what the 
        word Freedom is for her. A few paragraphs later, she offers her definition 
        of a <i>true concept</i>:</font> </p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Later 
        Marsden will develop her theory of feeling, perception and the soul, but 
        in this piece, adapting Bergson&#8217;s philosophy to her needs, she proceeds 
        to attack the Suffragist movement, which she sees as moving mechanically, 
        while she believes that what is needed is the natural vitality of a movement 
        &#8220;surging, living, uprising, taking its own wayward living course.&#8221; (p. 
        5). </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Concluding, 
        she denounces the emptiness of the expression &#8220;Woman Movement&#8221;, which 
        she believes should be discarded, for &#8220;Accurately speaking, there <i>is</i> 
        no &#8216;Woman Movement&#8217;&#8221; but only &#8220;a very limited number of individual women&#8221; 
        who claim their individuality and do not want to be lumped together into 
        &#8220;a class, a sex, or &#8216;a movement&#8217;&#8221;, nor be defined according to a function, 
        that of Mother in particular. Both &#8220;Woman&#8221; and &#8220;Mother&#8221;, are for her empty 
        concepts which have no reality. They have been created for the subordination 
        of the individual to the community, the state, the race but they are unreal. 
        The characteristic of &#8216;Mother&#8217; is only temporary and accidental, and if 
        a woman becomes a mother it is only because she so desires.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Starting 
        with the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; as a single, separate individual who has 
        needs and desires, Marsden ends her discourse by giving a definition of 
        <i>egoism</i> and <i>egoist</i> which she extends to all individuals:</font></p>

              the Universe for the individual has no meaning apart from their

              women before mentioned maintain that their own fitting description 
              is that of<i> Individual: Ends-in-themselves. They are Egoists</i>. 
              They are Autocrats, and the government of their autocracy is vested 
              in the Self....The intensive satisfaction of the Self is for the 
              individual the one goal in life. (emphasis mine, 5)</font>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On 
        this same definition, a few issues later, Ezra Pound will base his concept 
        of the autonomy of the author from his public.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It 
        is not difficult to detect in Marsden&#8217;s version of anarchist individualism 
        her political, social and feminist myopia. Her attacks on the WSPU and 
        Emmeline Pankhurst, though certainly based on founded criticism, need 
        not bring her to the point of negating the value of the suffragist movement 
        or of women's solidarity. In a solipsistic attitude, she generalizes from 
        her own experience without showing any awareness of the way ideas, and 
        imagination&#8212;not only perceptions&#8212;can shape a woman&#8217;s body and a woman&#8217;s 
        behavior.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">However, 
        there are some points which it is important to emphasize: the relevance 
        she gives to the body as the source of experience, of feeling and of action 
        and as the place where the sense of self is located. Also, a positive 
        sense of self, based on an acknowledged power of the body, seems an appropriate 
        proposal to be addressed to women who need to overcome the self-sacrificing, 
        angelic ideal of a female self, represented as weak and without desires, 
        totally identified with the maternal function.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the way Marsden formulates her attacks on labor and feminist causes she 
        also reveals herself a daughter of her times and throws light on her own 
        vision of the future in art. Empty concepts are for her empty words and 
        these are also empty symbols. It is not difficult to detect in this a 
        &#8216;modernist&#8217; attack to decadent, fin de si&egrave;le, ways of representing reality, 
        and indirectly, to symbolism in art.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of 
        Mrs. Pankhurst Marsden writes that she &#8220;ventured <i>into the maze of the 
        symbolists</i>, whose vulturous progeny--the empty concepts--got her.&#8221; 
        The useless self-sacrifice of Emily Wilding Davison, who flung herself 
        in front of the King&#8217;s horse at the Derby, is for her also a clear instance 
        of the negative effects of such symbolic words as (women&#8217;s) &#8220;Freedom&#8221;:</font></p>

        and from self, not only expresses a criticism of Victorian sexual and 
        cultural practices, but echoes a critical discourse that runs through 
        most modernist movements. While denouncing Symbolist expressions, whose 
        performative effects she finds so devastating, however, her own words 
        bear evidence of their still pervasive presence.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To 
        the pleasurable sensation so dear to decadent orgiasts, lost in their 
        ideals as in narcotic fumes, Marsden opposes the tell-tale truth of the 
        Soul&#8217;s feeling and of sensorial perception. To contemplation she opposes 
        action. Across the Channel, in Paris a woman experimenter in art, Gertrude 
        Stein, following her own path arrives at an analogous conclusion when 
        she rejects names and prefers verbs, and their progressive and infinitive 
        forms, because capable of representing unending process and vital movement.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the same first issue, Huntly Carter, a psychologist and follower of Bergson&#8217;s 
        philosophy, who used to write reviews for <i>The Freewoman</i>, contributes 
        the first article devoted to art, revealingly entitled &#8220;The Golden Age&#8221;. 
        Using expressions that borrow from symbolist metaphors, as well as from 
        Nietzschian ideas, he attacks the present materialistic age that, he thinks, 
        lives &#8220;in the Past&#8221;, be it Greece or India. Agreeing with Marsden, he 
        believes that what is needed in the present is &#8220;a new desire - a desire 
        to realize our spiritual potentialities&#8221;. There is nothing new in Carter&#8217;s 
        very romantic desire, except a Nietzschean stance, for only individuals 
        with independent personality can have this desire, individuals who are 
        seers and not logicians, who use &#8220;intelligence and not intellect&#8221;. &#8220;Art, 
        he writes, should discover &#8220;a definite language of the Soul... a simple, 
        true and common language&#8221; because &#8220;the principles of Art correspond to 
        those of the Soul... Art and Soul are one&#8221; (p. 16). &#8220;Soul&#8221; is for him 
        the precise word for Art, because Art should not be mistaken with technique. 
        By modeling itself on the soul Art can capture the vibrative force of 
        Life, for Art is Life-centered and not man-centered. (p. 17). &#8220;Soul&#8221;, 
        though undefined, is clearly an important word, which, together with the 
        opposition between &#8220;intelligence&#8221; and &#8220;intellect&#8221; will also come up again 
        in Marsden&#8217;s own contributions on art.</font></p>

        till the magazine shuts down. Besides a great number of letters,  critical 
        and literary contributions reveal how the theme is a widespread object 
        of study and reflection (see, for instance the review &#8220;Individualism&#8221;

        idea of the Beautiful as Sublime and Picturesque, and the opposite detached

              apparently has wants whose satisfactions are essential to growth. 
              Growth in the body is expressed in increasing extent, size. Growth 
              in the soul is expressed in increasing consistency, power of holding 
              together, integration as a separate individualized unit. (<i>The

        it does, and what it does is &#8220;to rally the soul into complete self-possession 
        after being scattered by experience&#8221; (p. 104).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Marsden&#8217;s 
        perspective is that of the person who experiences the beautiful. Pragmatically, 
        the Beautiful, with her, is justified by its performative effects on the 
        experiencer. On this point, however, Marsden reveals a split in her philosophy, 
        where pragmatic and anarchist attitudes diverge. In aesthetics she can 
        see the effect of the &#8220;Beautiful&#8221; only because it is conveyed by sensorial 
        experience but in politics she fails to acknowledge the imaginative experience 
        contained in words, like &#8220;Freedom&#8221; of &#8220;Justice&#8221; or &#8220;Women&#8217;s movement&#8221;,

        so tenuous with, still ... definite and concrete spots in it&#8221; (p. 107). 
        The modern poet, just like Villon in his own time, must be able to put 
        in his poems &#8220;the anemic shop-girl at the Exhibition, with her bad teeth 
        and her cheap black frock&#8221; (p. 109). Hueffer&#8217;s poet is the heir of the 
        great traditions, the heir of all ages. The purpose of his explorations 
        of the past, however, &#8220;is the appreciation of such facets of our own Day

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>3. The serious artist and the art of the future</b></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Issue 
        number 9 opens on the first and second parts of Ezra Pound&#8217;s &#8220;The Serious 
        Artist&#8221; which takes the place of Marsden&#8217;s editorial. This has never happened 
        before, but it is not to be taken as a sign of Pound&#8217;s rising power within 
        the magazine, even though Marsden had left London to concentrate on her 
        own philosophical work. Rather, the piece is a lengthy answer to a problematic 
        question addressed to the poet by the editor herself who is exploring 
        art and literature as part of a new individualist philosophy and politics. 
        As Pound explains in the opening paragraph, he has been asked to respond 
        to the &#8220;relation of the arts to economics...what position the arts are 
        to hold in the ideal republic.&#8221; (<i>The New Freewoman, </i>I: 9, 1913, 
        p.161). Marsden has herself given an answer to the role of aesthetics, 
        but she wants an insider for enlightenment on art&#8217;s economic and ethic 
        functions.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        what he calls a modern &#8220;Defense of Poetry,&#8221; Pound expounds his positivist 
        vision of the arts for &#8220;literature, poesy, are a science, just as chemistry 
        is a science. Their subject is man, mankind and the individual...&#8221; The 
        arts give us a great percentage of the lasting and unassailable data regarding 
        the nature of man, of immaterial man, of man considered as a thinking 
        and sentient creature&#8221; (p. 161). Here, for Pound, also resides <i>art&#8217;s 
        ethical</i> function: for bad art is immoral and good art is the art the 
        bears &#8220;true witness&#8221;  and defines &#8220;the inner nature and conditions of 
        man&#8221; (p.162). As for a social, economic and politic function of art coherent 
        with Marsden&#8217;s philosophy of egoist individualism, its value comes from 
        the fact that good art is precise and, because of this, it reveals the 
        different nature of each individual. Pound&#8217;s anti-socialist position joins 
        forces with Marsden&#8217;s radical anarchism opening up to a vision where state 
        and art are isomorphic to a society of individuals: &#8220;No perfect state 
        will be founded on the theory, or on the working hypothesis that all men 
        are alike. No science save the arts will give us the requisite data for 
        learning in what ways men differ&#8221; (p.163).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Above 
        all, Pound maintains, art should be valued for its relation to life and 
        to fundamental issues. Touching these last, he writes, &#8220;the arts give 
        us our data of psychology, of man as to his interiors, as to the ration 
        of his thought to his emotions, etc.&#8221; and concludes: &#8220;The touchstone of 
        art is its precision&#8221; (163). Here is the overall value of art. However, 
        Pound believes that only a specialist can determine the value of a work 
        of art. The specialist is his version of the artist as scientist, an artist 
        who, like the scientist, abstracts from the &#8220;aegrum vulgus&#8221; (p. 163).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the third part, published with the sub-title &#8220;Emotion and Poesy&#8221; in the 
        following issue, Pound develops his definition of art which, though aware 
        of Bergson&#8217;s vital flow also present in Marsden&#8217;s philosophy, and still 
        coherent with his analogy with science, leaves the medical field and moves 
        into thermodynamics: &#8220;the thing that matters in art is a sort of energy, 
        something more or less like electricity or radio activity, a force <i>transfusing, 
        welding, and unifying</i>&#8221; (emphasis mine, <i>The New Freewoman </i>I: 
        10, 1913, p.194). He does not specify <i>what</i> is &#8220;unified&#8221;, &#8220;welded&#8221; 
        or &#8220;transfused&#8221; but his verbs dilate and further articulate what Marsden 
        had identified as the function of the Beautiful: that of integrating, 
        restoring coherence and unity in the Soul.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Though 
        apparently proceeding along the same line of thought as Hueffer, Pound 
        moves away from his nineteenth century impressionism, when he states that 
        &#8220;&#8216;Good writing&#8217; is perfect control&#8221; (p. 194) of that interior force or 
        energy. Here, for him, also lies the major difference between prose and 
        poetry, for poetry is &#8220;more highly energized&#8221; than prose. Poetry, in fact, 
        expresses both emotions and ideas, it is &#8220;an &#8216;Intellectual and Emotional 
        Complex&#8217;&#8221; where ideas and emotions &#8220;must be in harmony...must form an 
        organism...must be an oak sprung from a acorn.&#8221; (p. 195).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
        organicist metaphor reveals how Pound&#8217;s idea of poetry is still deeply 
        rooted in romanticism. His need to compare it with prose, however, brings 
        to the fore one of the major sources of innovation in twentieth century 
        poetry: its competition with prose (and with painting) which moves poets 
        to seek their models in narrators like Balzac , Flaubert and James or 
        Tolstoy and Turgenev and their writing methods. This much is implied by 
        Pound&#8217;s assertion that: &#8220;Good writing is writing that is perfectly controlled, 
        the writer says just what he means. He says it with complete clarity and 
        simplicity. He uses the smallest possible number of words&#8221; (p. 194). Emphasis 
        on technique, also, separates the twentieth century from the romantic 
        poet. Pound knows that technique applies both to ideas and to sound: &#8220;when 
        the vowel and consonantal melody or sequence seems truly to bear the trace 
        of emotion which the poem...is intended to communicate, we say that this 
        part of the work is good.&#8221; (p.194).</font></p>

        poetic organism, thus, is more complex, but also more complete than prose:</font></p>

        concludes in the last installment of his article, is &#8220;maximum efficiency

        is nurtured by an interior energy which has separated from the flow of 
        natural energy but which participates in it: this energy moves in and 
        out of the body increasing or diminishing with each experience.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In

        lead from Pound&#8217;s essay, even sharing his analogy of poetry and science, 
        but following it to its extreme and applying it to the object of art, 
        she also goes in a completely different direction.</font></p>

        which if not divine, is too much above the common level to be comprehended 
        by the Philistine, or common-sense-man&#8221; (p. 181). Hers is an open critique 
        to Pound&#8217;s statement that &#8220;one work of art is worth forty prefaces and 
        as many apologia&#8221; (I: 9, p. 161) where he clearly subscribes to the idea 
        that the work itself, and not the artist&#8217;s elucidation, is the best explanation 
        of art, but also of his defining poetry in terms of &#8220;energy&#8221; without further 
        analysing the contents of that energy. For her the artist&#8217;s lack of comprehension 
        of what he is about is a matter for regret rather than comprehension. 
        In this way the artists &#8220;are in the position the alchemists and astrologers

        181). Like science, she maintains, art should adopt the experimental method 
        and make its advances by &#8220;unprejudiced observation of the &#8216;thing.&#8217;&#8221; Only 
        when science adopted the experimental method, she maintains, it broke 
        &#8220;the dominion of the guess&#8212;the imaginative interpretation.&#8221; Logician and 
        rationalist as she is, she of course misses once again the creative power 
        of imagination, but notwithstanding this clear limit, she acutely points 
        out the limits of contemporary art, part of which follows authority and 
        discipline, while the other is ideological art, or expresses the individual 
        whim. Drama especially, she writes, does not follow the motions of the 
        soul, but only ideas, for this reason its words are not in touch with 
        living forces.</font></p>

        with words, and using words somewhat close to Martin Heidegger&#8217;s definition 
        of hidden, unveiled reality, Marsden maintains that an art in line with 
        science should explore &#8220;the sphere of the occult: &#8220;<i>the occult is the 
        sense of the at-present hidden</i>, but discoverable, the at-present unknown, 
        but knowable, capable of being observed&#8221; (emphasis mine, p. 182). What 
        remains occult is the soul, which &#8220;breaks into evidence as readily as

        first lists the passions of the soul, for they have always been the field 
        of art and poetry. But she goes beyond passions, for she asks the artist 
        to discover what material facts, what movements of the soul are connected 
        with abstract concepts, like Beauty or Love. As for passions, she is not 
        satisfied with the way they have been treated. Love, for instance, the 
        only feeling or emotion which has been the object of continuous and serious 
        attention, still means sentimentalism or animal passion or is scorned. 
        But love offers suggestions of concrete phenomena:</font></p>

              of love, in the severances that are unprepared-for, the loss appears 
              actual...a loss of soul substance, a definite and tangible mutilation

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        passions in her list may be universal, yet what Marsden specifies about 
        love reveals an attention, and a need deeply rooted in the way she herself 
        as woman must have felt about it. She may not have been aware of it, but 
        in her request to the poet she voices a need of words for feelings and 
        emotions deeply felt, which she does not find expressed in art. It is 
        the same need which in the 1970s would make Adrienne Rich denounce the 
        absence of words for women&#8217;s feelings and passions. She would herself 
        try to answer with her own poetry, beginning with <i>The Dream of a Common 
        Language</i> of 1978.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        Marsden, however, the soul harbors not only passions, but the emotions 
        usually expressed by abstract words. For this reason she believes that 
        the matter of intellect could &#8220;be merged and explained in the tale of 
        the emotions.&#8221; Intellect, she writes, may be instinct and be &#8220;well served 
        by the senses.&#8221; To sum up: &#8220;feeling is all in all&#8221; and knowledge is but 
        &#8220;the co-ordination of feeling repeated in experience&#8221; (p. 183). The way 
        Marsden imagines the functioning of the senses anticipates both H. D. 
        and Virginia Woolf, whose work can also be read as an answer to her request 
        on this point.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        senses, Marsden writes, &#8220;are attenuated feeling, filaments of the soul-stuff 
        drawn fine, told off from the deeper-seated well of life to stand on sentinel 
        duty at the periphery...their attention turned outward&#8221;. The senses are 
        placed mainly in the head and reach out  through the eye, &#8220;the gateway 
        of the <i>exploring </i>filament&#8221; (p. 183). In &#8220;Beauty and the Senses&#8221; 
        she gives further details on the work of the senses:</font></p>

              of matter outwards towards the external surface. They are the fringe 
              of soul where feeling, i. e., life, runs thinnest, slender feelers, 
              some too fine to feel more than the dimmest awareness of the shiver 
              of contact; and some broader and stronger. The effect...of this 
              difference in density and in intensity which is indicated in the 
              use of the two terms &#8220;soul&#8221; and &#8220;sense&#8221; is to enable a life-unit 
              to ingratiate itself into the phenomenal world with a minimum implication 
              of emotion in experience. The organisation of the senses represents 
              caution embodied in the structure of life. The senses have a twofold 
              action...Scouts outwardly they are sentinel inward. (<i>The New

        in July 1919, when she was recovering from illness and from childbirth 
        in the Scilly Islands. This is also the only essay where H. D. goes into

        D. goes much farther than Marsden and tries to formulate a female poetics 
        where both the mind and the reproductive organ, have feelers reaching 
        inside and outside. H. D. may not have been aware of Marsden&#8217;s request 
        to the artist nor of her theory of the senses but she did try to describe 
        the creative process from a woman artist&#8217;s point of view. In it she also 
        accounts for an essential difference between man and woman rooted in the 
        body and in its power to give birth, as well as in the actual experience 
        of maternity. In this way, and for the first time in modernist poetics 
        she speaks of something that was relevant for Marsden: sexuality and its 
        relevance in art.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Awareness 
        of the potential to give birth as a distinct power of a woman&#8217;s body was 
        missing in Marsden, who thought it a liability or rather a source of weakness 
        in women. It was a limit, because she could not see how it made women 
        different from men, not only their intellectual equals. On the other hand, 
        her emphasis on the work of the senses and her connecting of emotions, 
        senses, intellect and soul was her way of telling how important it was 
        for a contemporary artist to search for contact with inner and outer experience.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Contact</i> 
        is a key-word with her. She believes that &#8220;all the senses are senses of 
        touch, i. e., contact&#8212;the impinging of organized life upon the things 
        foreign to itself; the shiver of difference, and the shrinking where the 
        &#8216;I&#8217; is touched by the &#8216;not I&#8217; &#8212;suggestions merely, indicative of the things 
        which await the insight of the artists of the future&#8221; (&#8220;The Art of the 
        Future,&#8221; p. 183). Valuing what H. D. wrote, W. C. Williams, who&#8217;d began 
        contributing to <i>The New Freewoman</i>, would develop a poetics of &#8220;the 
        thing&#8221;, and of sensorial &#8220;contact&#8221; as the path to knowledge and to a poetry 
        in touch with life. </font></p>

        her discourse, in &#8220;The Art of the Future&#8221; Marsden states that while all 
        arts should delineate this contact, poetry is &#8220;the highest manifestation 
        of self-consciousness, <i>re</i>-presented in terms of self-recognised 
        emotion. In poetry self-consciousness culminates: in it alone emotion 
        rounds on itself, articulate, and says &#8216;I know you&#8217;&#8221; (183).</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Referring 
        to Pound&#8217;s stated difference between prose and poetry, she goes one step 
        further. In her own definition of poetry, she moves from simile to metaphor, 
        indirectly implying that between the methods of art and those of science 
        there is not so much analogy as identity, since their respective objects 
        participate in a wider realm which unites emotion and intellect, human 
        beings and the universe:</font></p>

              inquiring into. The difference is one of brevity, completeness and 
              finish simply because in poetry all evidence of laboratory work 
              is removed; the creaking of the thinking-machine is not there: it 
              has done its work. Poetry is the expression of the soul-motion: 
              perfect knowledge free both of redundancy and hesitancy: it is brief 
              because it is reduced to the exact equivalent: it has reached the 
              completeness of knowledge when its dimensions can be expressed in 
              a formula. It<i> is</i> the formula. (p. 183)</font></p>

        definition of poetry is the end-tail, and tale, of a circular process 
        of reflection and self-reflection which began in the first issue of <i>The 
        Freewoman</i> as political action, with Dora Marsden&#8217;s founding the journal 
        in order to build a woman&#8217;s consciousness of her self, and ends in poetry 
        as the perfect formula &#8220;speaking of the truth concerning oneself&#8221; (&#8220;Beauty 
        and the Senses&#8221;, p. 203) not so much as woman but as separate, genderless, 
        individual, in search of her sole/soul&#8217;s desire.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        the two years from the beginning of her adventure, Marsden has grown more 
        interested in her own thinking and writing than in anybody else&#8217;s and 
        introspection has become an end in itself. Poetry and art, together with 
        philosophy, have become her privileged paths to personal knowledge, and 
        the highest form of self-expression. It is at this point that she finally 
        cuts all links with the woman&#8217;s movement and with feminist issues.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Within 
        this process it is clear that the letter written by Pound and others and 
        published in the last issue of <i>The New Freewoman</i>, which I quoted 
        in the first part of this article, was the pretext which she used to move 
        explicitly into the realm of individualist egoism, discarding the feminist 
        origins of the paper and its political force. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">But 
        &#8220;egoism&#8221; also destroyed Dora Marsden. Feminists never forgave her political 
        myopia and also lost touch with what was good in her endeavor. The writers 
        to whom she had opened her paper soon forgot her and critics followed 
        in the same line, so much so that they forgot the political and feminist 
        origins of<i> The Egoist</i>. Following Eliot and only partly Pound, formalist 
        literary criticism emphasised technique and either timelessness or a combinatorial 
        time dimension, flying history and the present, and offered a decontextualized 
        design of the modernist Anglo-American literary avant-garde. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">An 
        example can be cited as an illustration of how this happened in T. S. 
        Eliot&#8217;s edition of E. Pound&#8217;s <i>Literary Essays</i> (Faber 1954). There 
        &#8220;The Serious Artist&#8221; is wrongly said to have been taken &#8220;from <i>The Egoist 
        </i>A. D. 1913.<i>&#8221;</i> This may have been a trick of memory, but it goes 
        a long way in revealing that Dora Marsden&#8217;s journal, <i>The New Freewoman</i>, 
        where it had originally been published, and the cultural and political 
        space she had created for herself and other women and men, in the intervening 
        years had been usurped by the two poets and their hegemonic idea of poetry 
        and literature. With it went her suggested exploration of feelings and 
        of interiority. H. D., W. C. Williams and Virginia Woolf, who were much 
        closer to her, had been too marginalized in the outline of the master 
        narrative of modernist poetics to have any real impact until the fifties 
        and the sixties, when things began to change. A new crop of women poets,

        in the second of the notes published in <i>The New Freewoman</i> no. 11, 
        Marsden openly admitted the importance of American readers to the publication 
        of the journal, it was not to give thanks for their support. Rather, hers 
        was an answer to the amount of criticism she was receiving both from her 
        anarchist readers, like Benjamin Tucker, and her feminist subscribers, 
        whose letters and criticism were published in the comments following her 
        piece. For different reasons, they rejected her radically solipsistic,
