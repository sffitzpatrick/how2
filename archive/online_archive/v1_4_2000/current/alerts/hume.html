        Like many excellent books by young poets, Prageeta Sharma&#8217;s aggressively 
        blurs institutionally endorsed &#8220;schools&#8221; of poetics, and some of the liveliest 
        examples in her <i>Bliss to Fill </i>act as weirdly wonderful piecemeal 
        recombinations of poetic tools and techniques. Her rich attempts to reconcile 
        competing claims of abstraction and representation lead her into investigations 
        of the original and the copy. The collection begins playing with the genres 
        of letter and dictionary&#8212;&#8220;Dear_____,&#8221; tricks out a defining impulse into 
        the space of seriality: </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sharma&#8217;s 
        world creates and recreates itself like &#8220;Zirma&#8221; in Calvino&#8217;s <i>Invisible 
        Cities</i>: &#8220;The city is redundant: it repeats itself so that something 
        will stick in the mind...Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that 
        the city can begin to exist.&#8221; In Sharma&#8217;s work, New York City repeats 
        signs and sounds so that its inhabitants can begin to recognize themselves. 
        Replications of structures build from the collection&#8217;s title and the epigraph 
        from Dickinson: &#8220;Our share of night to bear&#8212; / Our share of morning&#8212; / 
        Our blank in bliss to fill / Our blank in scorning&#8212;.&#8221; And Sharma aims 
        to fill a blank in bliss. She makes good on the zestful serendipity of 
        template (mad-lib) and collage techniques, and her results are as slippery 
        and playful as a Rosmarie Waldrop paragraph. Repetition (in traditional 
        and nonce forms alike) in Sharma&#8217;s work generates a misleading but potent 
        rhythm; we may not arrive where we thought we were going, but the march 
        carries us happily through. The book is as much a meditation of the inevitability 
        of imitation and duplication as a demonstration of delight in its small 
        variations. Sharma rhymes and chimes her way through as if each word were 
        a homophonic translation for the next. An ebullient cadence and devilish 
        diction, teetering on the verge of apprehension, pin-ball through <i>Bliss</i>. 
        Each word feels its way to the next with a fierce fidelity to the sound 
        and sense of language, and in doing so, poem after poem<i> </i>create 
        strange, searching linguistic landscapes. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ironically, 
        one of the words Sharma utters again and again is &#8220;real&#8221;: &#8220;To feel that 
        children are innocently real&#8221;; &#8220;...to fret a discourse to you, sunshine, 
        will not let me discover the gears // to real sensations&#8221;; &#8220;we stop / 
        the poem from the real dream that stood underneath her&#8221;; &#8220;...the fastest 
        way to count your own real red chickens&#8221;; &#8220;first you have to become a 
        real person, so to speak.&#8221; She creates an artificial space in which to 
        replicate &#8220;the real,&#8221; and so reveals its absurdities and amusements. The 
        urban jungle reproduces itself everywhere as does the self&#8212;all things 
        subject to definition in Sharma&#8217;s work are subject to replication and 
        analogy. And definitions pattern her work, yet they ask to be read reciprocally 
        rather than cumulatively. &#8220;&#8216;The most beautiful analogy // of repeatable 
        space&#8217;&#8221; is the face, says a speaker in one poem. Of course, the symmetry 
        of the face displays a structural reflection, and a tendency to see in 
        terms of reflection, enacting Walter Benjamin&#8217;s idea that &#8220;the gift we 
        possess for seeing similarity is nothing but a feeble vestige of the formerly 
        powerful compulsion to be similar and to behave mimetically.&#8221; &#8220;Poorly 
        matched the world and she / or so her best self would say.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        first section of the book (which is divided into two chapbook-like sections) 
        is bracketed by &#8220;Dear______&#8221; and &#8220;Apology,&#8221; both epistolary poems that 
        could be addressed to the reader or a lover. Her use of doubles recalls 
        Ashbery, especially in their stunt-person-like ability to argue with themself, 
        to mock and expose their own romantic notions and visionary aspirations. 
        Sharma insists, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know me anymore. This will be a re-occurring 
        theme.&#8221; The prismatic self&#8212;&#8220;a blank and simply symphonic you&#8221; refracting 
        experience, transmuting representations of self&#8212;allows utter self-doubt 
        and confidence, vulnerability and invisibility to co-exist. Yet &#8220;no flowery 
        dualism&#8221; resides here. Multiple subjectivity bends toward relationships, 
        not a dynamic sense of self, and underscores one of the book&#8217;s obsessions&#8212;misunderstandings, 
        lamentable and laudatory, implicit in all communication, but especially 
        between intimates. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        mischievous delight taken in the slippage of daily communication here 
        serves to complicate relationships in the first section and focuses more 
        on cultures and lifestyles (rock star, poet, vendor, assassin, suburbanite) 
        in the second.  Urban human relations in <i>Bliss</i> percolate with &#8220;cranky 
        spark&#8221; and &#8220;mistakes worth claiming.&#8221; Sharma combines the elastic loopiness 
        of O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s improvisational riffs on idiom and the creepiness of Berryman&#8217;s 
        colloquial twists; she embraces the infelicities of American street talk 
        and the diction of translation guidebooks and cartoons: &#8220;You are pointing 
        west when you say dish-desh&#8221;; &#8220;I am happy to be organized with my problems.&#8221; 
        Disjunctive dialogues continually morph the terms of argument and short 
        circuit in frenetic and funny inflations. The book pulses with mania that&#8217;s 
        checked by a straight-faced delivery, a real delivery, Sharma might say, 
        and a real joy.</font> </p>
