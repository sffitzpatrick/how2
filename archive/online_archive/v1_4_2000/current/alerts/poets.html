      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        don&#8217;t just make books; I also make sculpture and installation art. But 
        the books are really my big love, because they&#8217;re intimate and personal 
        and interactive in a way the other work isn&#8217;t as much. I really like to 
        write even though I don&#8217;t consider myself a writer; I like puns, the multiple 
        meanings and associations of words, how words sound. I&#8217;m doing word assemblage. 
        I make assemblage sculpture and that&#8217;s what I do with words. I put unlikely 
        words together and that&#8217;s how I create other stories.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I&#8217;ve 
        been making books since 1991. My primary source for art supplies is the 
        flea market; I&#8217;m intrigued by other people&#8217;s detritus. At some point I 
        started using other people&#8217;s cast off words. I would take parts of books 
        and cut them up and juxtapose them with parts of other books, such as 
        a sex manual with a hunting guide. Writing in this way, I came up with 
        lots of surprises that I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have come up with on my 
        own.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        themes of my work have to do with sexuality, history, Jewish identity, 
        challenging the status quo, class, economics. I try to take these serious 
        issues with as much levity as I can. I hate work that&#8217;s didactic, but 
        I also always want to take jabs at the system, the inhuman forms of existence 
        that we all are forced to live unde<span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>r.</span></font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
        are a number of ways I work. One is to delete parts of a text and leave 
        words in that form a completely different text, one that usually subverts 
        the original. That&#8217;s the case with <i>That Two-Edged Bliss</i>, which 
        came from a book called<i>, When Knighthood Was in Flower.</i> I delete 
        text in many different ways: covering it with strips of money, cutting 
        it with an exacto-knife, sewing it out, taping it out; I use all sorts 
        of methods to hide or partially hide original text and let other words 
        come out.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>That 
        Two-Edged Bliss</i> is one of a number of pieces that I&#8217;ve done about 
        being bisexual and how a lot of people have a difficult time with that 
        because it&#8217;s not one or the other; it&#8217;s both/and not either/or. I got 
        this weird old book and started picking it apart, taking out large amounts 
        of text and leaving certain words. I found images from various sources 
        &#8212; old encyclopedias, women&#8217;s magazines from the 1950&#8217;s, sewing books, 
        religious and historical photographs &#8212; and paired them with the pages 
        in an intuitive way. I just gravitate to certain images. I pair them if 
        my gut tells me to; I try to go with that without thinking too much about 
        it.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another 
        way I work is to cut out phrases from one book, or sometimes more than 
        one.  In the case of <i>Selections from Mein Kampf</i>, I had a copy from 
        the flea market. I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do with it but I knew 
        I had to have it, because how often do you come across a copy of <i>Mein 
        Kampf</i> from the 1940&#8217;s?  It sat around in my studio for several years 
        emitting toxic rays. One day I just had it cut up into several pieces. 
        I ended up making four books out of it. In one, I burnt out text; in another, 
        I covered text with strips of Hebrew writing; in a third, I used a tape 
        transfer method to obliterate parts of the text. On the one shown here, 
        I tore out phrases from the original and reassembled them to make poems 
        in which Hitler expresses remorse and contradictory feelings about what 
        he has done. I sewed them together onto pieces of a Hebrew prayer book 
        that I&#8217;d found in a second hand store in a state of complete disrepair 
        &#8212; I felt guilty about using it but it was already falling apart.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sewing 
        plays a very important role in my work. My background is in textiles. 
        My parents were upholsterers; I grew up around fabric and thread and needles 
        and learned how to sew at an early age. In my sculpture I use sewing as 
        a way of drawing, of creating line. In books, it&#8217;s a way of integrating 
        text from different sources. I find zig-zag a great way of making the 
        transition between different kinds of paper; it makes the page more of 
        an integrated whole rather than one paper stuck on another. Plus, I really 
        like sewing things that are not normally sewn; I sew everything from paper 
        to wood to metal. I like its associations with domestic, traditionally 
        women&#8217;s work and craft and using that in my art. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I&#8217;ve 
        been really interested in the three-dimensional and mechanical aspects 
        of reading and poetics. Conventional books pretty much have one way they 
        work mechanically; they do have a third dimension, but the two-dimensional 
        page is more central. Most of the work I&#8217;ve done has been sculptural, 
        oftentimes with more than one mechanical feature. Some of these pieces 
        emphasize one feature of a book, say the turning of a page as a repetitive 
        motion, while limiting other graphic possibilities. There&#8217;s an exaggeration 
        of the object status of the book. Using found objects in the sculptures 
        has given me so much to go on conceptually and in terms of design incidents; 
        there was an immediate dialogue with those objects that helped me to figure 
        out how to structure a book. With found objects, their material history 
        has been immediately apparent. The interplay between that and the text 
        has been accessible to me and the viewer. I&#8217;m now trying to work with 
        conventional forms or formats, both graphical and structural, as being 
        in some way found &#8212; a shift from an actual old object to something slightly 
        more abstract &#8212; but trying to take on the convention in the same critical 
        (in the sense of exploratory) way.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        think the sculptures were my way into books; I was hesitant to take on 
        the conventional book format and was more interested in figuring out what 
        about that format drew me, by playing out different aspects of that. Now 
        that I&#8217;m figuring out what those single factors were, I&#8217;m getting up the 
        courage to face the conventional book.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        have also made catalogs that accompanied and documented exhibitions of 
        the sculptures. They contain all the texts that were incorporated in the 
        sculptures, yet have their own being. The emphasis of the show, an ephemeral 
        event, was on fragmentation and dissemination. Say I wrote a text and 
        paired it with six linotype draw<i>e</i>rs. That text might then be divided 
        into six parts; each drawer would become one chapter in the text. The 
        exhibition was the event where you would see the whole thing, but I would 
        sell the six pieces separately: the ultimate fate of those objects was 
        to get pulled off in bits. The catalog was a concession of a not quite 
        admitted desire on my part for the text to have some endurance; it grouped 
        and kept it whole; in that way it was a lot more like a traditional book. 
        At that point, the traditional book form couldn&#8217;t satisfy the more radical 
        interest to have things more temporary, more contingent on context, that 
        the shows provided for me. It&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;m trying to figure out 
        how a book might less have that pretense to being permanent and whole.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        texts are almost all the product of the process of cutting up existing 
        texts and recomposing them. It starts with choosing a few books that interest 
        me and trying to scan, not really read, the texts, like an airplane going 
        over a landscape. I cut them out and have a whole system of arranging 
        those bits.  If I already know there&#8217;s going to be a theme that I&#8217;m writing 
        about, I might arrange according to that theme; but usually the arrangement&#8217;s 
        grammatical. This method of composition is a way of creating a dialogue 
        between me and these bits of text rather than trying to find something 
        within my head without that kind of prompt. It&#8217;s definitely influenced 
        by surrealist and automatic writing and other kinds of rule-based and 
        chance composition, but I&#8217;m not that systematic; it&#8217;s not about demonstrating 
        something by pure experiment, it&#8217;s just a way for me to write. The bits 
        that I&#8217;ve cut out have gotten smaller and smaller; basically, they&#8217;re 
        single words now, whereas when I started out, they would be whole sentences, 
        citations of whole thoughts. There has been a real continuity between 
        that process of writing and the next step of setting type &#8212; and the found 
        objects, which would determine everything from the structure of the piece 
        to the size of the edition. I used to work with multiple determinations: 
        for every step, every decision, I would make sure I had material determinations 
        to work with. Now that&#8217;s changing somewhat. I don&#8217;t necessarily work with 
        type and I&#8217;m doing less found object work. But the texts themselves still 
        come out of a material, concrete, exchange with words.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>At 
        the wheel </i>is part of a series of texts, included in the exhibition 
        and catalog <i>Wards of Obsolescence, </i>that I wrote under the influence 
        of Walter Benjamin&#8217;s <i>The</i> <i>Arcades Project</i>. <i>The</i> <i>Arcades 
        Project</i> is the hidden center of Benjamin&#8217;s entire oeuvre, a thousand 
        pages of notes, fragments, quotations, citations, about the arcades of 
        Paris as the perfect 19<sup>th</sup> century construct. The arcades were 
        a favorite image for surrealist writers; they held a ghost or aquarium 
        feeling, because they were already dead by the beginning of the twentieth 
        century; Benjamin saw them as greenhouses for 19<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>th</span></sup> 
        century dream images. This year, <i>The Arcades Project </i>has finally 
        been translated into English; I had for years had the French translation. 
        It&#8217;s been for me an infinitely inspiring source, including the whole series 
        of texts that <i>At the wheel</i> came from. I tried to take Benjamin 
        literally: he was saying we could make a critical history out of the stuff 
        itself. I thought I would take old stuff and make the books out of that, 
        using objects the way he regards them, as being revelatory about the implications 
        of the history that they carry. I took certain images as evocations of 
        modernity. <i>At the wheel</i> is the image of the ferris wheel &#8212; waiting 
        in line, getting on the wheel, entertainment &#8212; used to discuss the Benjaminian 
        idea of popular culture presenting pseudo-satisfactions of what are essentially 
        utopian dreams.  It&#8217;s about waiting for technology to give us what can 
        only come from social change.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
        presence of the human figure in the <i>Wards of Obsolescence</i> series 
        was on the level of society; I had been thinking about the writing of 
        history. Then I thought, what happens where existential and historical 
        time meet? A quote by Siegfried Kracauer, &#8220;The flight of images is the 
        flight from the revolution and death,&#8221; was the beginning of <i>Lives and 
        Property</i> for me. Kracauer was saying that the onslaught of the visual 
        in modern society not only keeps us from seeing real economic conditions 
        but also has an individual existential influence of keeping us from contemplating 
        our own death. Where do the social and societal and political intersect 
        with individual existence and the things &#8212; including death &#8212; that determine 
        and define individual existence? <i>Lives and Property </i>is an exploration 
        of that intersection. Death is in the middle of that text; the whole piece 
        is like a tombstone; everything about it is dark and dense, gray and closed 
        onto itself. The title refers to the way those things are counted and 
        named on an historical level: the damage of major conflicts, for example, 
        is counted in terms of lives and property. The piece looks at the relationship 
        between existence viewed from that historical point-of-view and existence 
        viewed from the first person point-of-view back up at history.</font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        began making books over a series of summers spent writing on the Danish 
        island of Bornholm. Most of my books are tiny </font>handwritten narratives 
        illustrated with drawings, watercolors or photographs in purchased blank 
        pocket notebooks. I&#8217;m not so interested in constructing the book itself; 
        I&#8217;d rather find a blank book ready-made and fill it. I made these books 
        because, on Bornholm, I&#8217;d have a lot of time and wanted to do something 
        other than writing. So I decided to illustrate some of my work; it was 
        a good way to bring together my drawing and painting and writing. I nearly 
        always began with the poem or story first.</p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        just don&#8217;t have that kind of time now, as I did on Bornholm<i>. </i>Since 
        those summers, most of my books are made as gifts because it&#8217;s the only 
        time I&#8217;ll give myself to do it. <i>The Brilliant Poet Series</i> was made 
        that way, four books written as an appreciation of the work of poet-friends 
        that I gave each of them as presents. Others are more private, only to 
        be read by the persons they were made for.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        see the small books as puppet theaters. The book is the stage, the pictures 
        are the puppets and scenery, and the text is the story. Making these books 
        is an efficient way to have my poems and stories performed &#8212; albeit, without 
        the impact of a whole room, though I like the intimacy of someone holding 
        the theater in her hands and watching it in private, at her own pace.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        said puppet theater because it is miniature, which I&#8217;m very drawn to &#8212; 
        the mock version of the real stage. With theater, I have trouble suspending 
        my disbelief. I can more easily enter opera, which is so false, or puppet 
        theater, and become totally absorbed by it.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There&#8217;s 
        a beautiful small cathedral in the city here that&#8217;s a miniature of a grand 
        cathedral; it has all the parts, but on a human scale; it&#8217;s elegant.  
        I feel very much more comfortable there than in a huge cathedral. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
        a child, I made things for myself, for my own pleasure, and these books 
        are made with that freedom. They weren&#8217;t made for anyone else to see, 
        except maybe close friends. The poems in the books are written in that 
        way also: none of them have been published elsewhere; they have no other 
        life outside these books.</font></p> <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
        a few cases, I didn&#8217;t begin with a completed text but wrote and illustrated 
        the book as I went along. I don&#8217;t feel they&#8217;re as good. There are parts 
        that I like, but I&#8217;d run out of ideas, I&#8217;d run out of juice, and so it&#8217;s 
        spotty. It works better when I have the text and then I look for images 
        that will provide the appropriate atmosphere. With <i>Kafka&#8217;s Grave</i>, 
        I let the pictures tell the story. I started out with the images, and 
        did write it as I was making it. But with <i>Opera for Two&#8212;you and who?, 
        Pearls Are Passing, </i>and<i> It, </i>I started with the text.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        found many of these images in art books, altering masterpieces to go with 
        my stories. Copying masterpieces is a great way to experience them. Often 
        the pictures are creating a tension with the words rather than illustrating 
        them.  For example, there&#8217;s a watercolor in <i>Pearls Are Passing</i> 
        of a man and a woman hanging by their legs over a cauldron, while the 
        text is something tender about love. </font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There&#8217;s 
        such joy in making these books, like playing. It&#8217;s a surprise that people 
        like them so much. They were made for purely personal consumption. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        used to write and make books as a child, so for me, making letterpress 
        books was a rediscovery of book making. When I took my first letterpress 
        class, I was completely enchanted by the typography, the ink, the type, 
        the smell of the ink, the feel of the paper, and the sounds of the machines. 
        I wanted to make a book that had a classical design, in terms of its proportions, 
        with crisp typography and lots of space on the page, so that the words 
        would come out at you. The structure of the book usually preceded the 
        writing of it. The size of the page, for example, greatly influenced the 
        writing; a long page is not the same as an 8-1/2&quot; by 11&quot; sheet 
        of paper. Everything that goes into the making of a book affects it.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With 
        <i>Fugitive,</i> my first letterpress book, I fit the writing into a very 
        strict, square form of 4 inches by 4 inches, using 4 sections of 4 pages, 
        each page with 4 stanzas of 4 couplets. I like to work in form, though 
        usually I find the form as I write. Once that happens, then I know I'm 
        moving in the right direction; the form helps to bring the whole together. 
        With <i>Fugitive</i>, the pattern was so strict that I wanted to break 
        with it, set it free. First there's one page that has five stanzas instead 
        of four. Then on another page I shifted from letterpress altogether and 
        hand-wrote the page in each book. I'm not quite sure how that came about. 
        Perhaps it's because of one of the lines on that page; it reads: &quot;In 
        America/space haunts, not architecture.&quot; The book, with its form, 
        is very architectural and the line is about a transition toward a dissimilar 
        place, a &quot;rupture from Europe.&quot; And that may have inspired me.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About 
        the same time, a friend and I began making one-of-a-kind books for each 
        other. Making these books was exciting for their immediacy. I could use 
        all kinds of materials that I couldn't use in letterpress, and the methods 
        were definitely a lot quicker. This exchange between the two of us became 
        a kind of dialogue, different from ordinary speech, like an exchange of 
        poems. We were making the books as gifts, as a way of creating something 
        just for the other person. A private gesture, as well as playful. Meanwhile, 
        I went on to print and design two more letterpress books, <i>Artist As 
        A Young Woman</i> and <i>In The Bed Of The Press</i>.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My 
        most recent one-of-a-kind books are handwritten with an antique Ladies' 
        Shaeffer fountain pen and illustrated with found photographs. The first 
        in the series, <i>A Botanist's Dream</i>, is about my grandfather, who 
        worked as a botanist at the Smithsonian into his 90's. After my grandfather 
        died, I was helping my mother sort through his things and came upon photographs 
        that were left unidentified. My mother was prepared to throw them away, 
        so I asked her to let me have them instead. One day I must have been thinking 
        again about making books. I took some paper and folded it and bound it 
        in a binding that I liked. I brought out the photographs. They were so 
        rich and interesting that it was quite easy to make connections and write 
        the book &#8212; a connection between a photograph and thinking of my grandfather, 
        a photograph and the feel of the ink pen scratching the surface of paper. 
        I really enjoyed the process of working with photographs; they helped 
        me find a direction for what I had to say.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        still have a book in this series that is partially completed. I've imagined 
        it, but I haven't written it; it's just kind of waiting. It's inspired 
        by a phrase in Keith Waldrop's poem, &quot;Poet&quot;: &quot;I build houses 
        that I will not inhabit.&quot; I found that very haunting. Not inhabiting. 
        It seems appropriate with books because once you've made them, they're 
        out there, separate from you. Somehow the handwritten books, because they're 
        more personal, because they're one-of-a-kind, maybe because they are handwritten 
        and not the printed page, still have a quality of intimacy.</font></p>

        started working with books when I was fairly young; in college I majored 
        in both English and art. Although I liked doing artwork, I didn&#8217;t like 
        the unique aspect; I was too attached to what I was doing. One of my original 
        attractions to printing was that not only could I combine art and words 
        but I could make multiples. I saw a show of work by students who were 
        printing pieces with both image and text; I asked one of them to show 
        me how to use the letterpress and made my first piece, a translation of 
        a St. Theresa of Avila poem with an etching.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
        college Kathy Walkup, Cheryl Miller and I started Five Trees Press. We 
        published several letterpress books, including poetry by H.D. and Denise 
        Levertov. I&#8217;ve worked in one capacity or another in graphics and book 
        design and editorial for thirty years now. At one point, I worked for 
        the artist Sam Francis, running his letterpress shop, The Lapis Press, 
        where I edited book projects with writers Michael Palmer, Kathleen Fraser, 
        and Bruce Boone, among others. Working with them helped me decide to take 
        my own writing more seriously. I entered the writing program at San Francisco 
        State, and I&#8217;ve been plugging along since.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        don&#8217;t know how I decide to do a particular book; I just take a fancy to 
        whatever it happens to be. Before I make the actual book, I have the writing, 
        or an idea of writing. But I like to have books evolve rather than be 
        planned out, as they have to be in my trade book work.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Chance 
        Meeting on a Train</i>, for example, is an evolved book. I positioned 
        printing plates in different ways and made monoprints, so that I had a 
        group of page spreads. For the text, I randomly circled phrases on a newspaper 
        page without looking, then shuffled the phrases together. I folded the 
        monoprinted pages, put them in an order and printed the random/found text 
        on them. I made an edition of three, but they&#8217;re each unique in that they&#8217;re 
        different monoprints.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I&#8217;ve 
        done a series of journal books that originated in on-going journal events 
        and existed as mail art pieces before they became books. One of these 
        is <i>Edna&#8217;s Death</i>, which I made when I was living with my grandmother 
        while she was dying. I felt so alienated from everybody; I couldn&#8217;t really 
        communicate that, it was tediously boring.  So I decided to make a mail 
        art piece in which, once a week, I would send something about this experience. 
        Some of the pieces are poems about exchanges between my grandmother and 
        me. One&#8217;s a note that I found about a story she tells of a friend of hers 
        that&#8217;s in the hospital. One&#8217;s a photograph of a parking meter outside 
        the mortuary  &#8212; they&#8217;ve put a bag over the head of the meter that says 
        &#8220;Funeral.&#8221; It seemed so appropriate that there was this obliterated time.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some 
        things look better in letterpress and some things look better in photocopy. 
        With <i>Edna&#8217;s Death,</i> I liked using photocopies and a typewriter face 
        because it had that more casual, this-is-happening-everyday look; it didn&#8217;t 
        look &#8220;worked.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        find myself drawn to making works that are both visual and verbal because 
        I think both are necessary to give fullness to whatever it is that I&#8217;m 
        trying to express. They&#8217;re really two expressions of the world, and they 
        don&#8217;t overlap. But when both are present, something about the interaction 
        transmutes the two into a third thing. So, say we have this bottle on 
        the table. And say I write something about it. That verbal expression 
        of the bottle captures a certain kind of essence about the bottle; it&#8217;s 
        an intellectualized thing. But if I draw the bottle, it&#8217;s an expression 
        that is radically different from the verbal. They&#8217;re not illustrations 
        of each other &#8212; they&#8217;re absolutely not illustrations of each other.  I 
        have to say I think the visual is more intuitive, but it&#8217;s not simply 
        about feeling. I would say that feeling is a third expression, permeating 
        the presence of both the verbal and visual. I&#8217;m not rating these in a 
        hierarchy. I&#8217;m not saying that the combination is better or more effective 
        than verbal or visual solely. That&#8217;s not the case. It&#8217;s that you have 
        three little worlds on a plate, three different forms of expression. I 
        think that&#8217;s right. I think that&#8217;s at the moment how it looks. </font></p>

      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thinking 
        about my own history of writing, it has become clear to me that it&#8217;s not 
        that there was poetry and then there were books; the materials and the 
        objects <i>were</i> the poetry. When I&#8217;m writing it&#8217;s not necessarily 
        to communicate, it&#8217;s to make something. Certain things can only exist 
        in the form you&#8217;re making; you can see things, you can understand things 
        that can&#8217;t exist in any other way. The issue of making the things comes 
        first; you can&#8217;t think about your audience. With artists&#8217; books, if I&#8217;m 
        making something with sticks and mud, I don&#8217;t worry about how will it 
        be sent in the mail or how someone will carry it. I don&#8217;t think about 
        how people are going to wrap up their merchandise; it&#8217;s not a primary 
        concern. For me, I was just busy wrapping books with gauze and sticking 
        plaster&#8212;I was literally bandaging books because they looked so beautiful. 
        I would do this with books I didn&#8217;t make, people like Mishima whom I found 
        difficult or disturbing. I thought, this would work better, making an 
        object beautiful or magical, so you could see it like a rattle or talisman 
        but wouldn&#8217;t have to literally traipse through each one.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For 
        other book artists, the wonderful thing would be realizing material into 
        the world. Cecilia Vicuna would leave little books made with sticks, writing, 
        thread, all over New York &#8212; they&#8217;d be distributed by people&#8217;s chancing 
        upon them. One of the most exciting things that happens with a book is 
        that people can read it or find it or exchange it. The idea of being able 
        to make multiples and put the book into distribution &#8212; artists can crack 
        open the censorship of the market, the barriers to what gets published. 
        An artist&#8217;s book can say, when normal presses aren&#8217;t going to take on 
        this material: This can be read or seen by others.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Looking 
        at the continuum of people working with artists&#8217; books, my own process 
        is way on the end of one of a kind; not just because they are one of a 
        kind but because I don&#8217;t get around to thinking,  &#8220;How do I make a thousand? 
        How do I send this out in the world?&#8221; &#8212; I am thinking of making a poetics. 
        There&#8217;s a difference between making artists&#8217; books that are within one&#8217;s 
        own realm of writing or practice, and having a press: with the press, 
        you&#8217;re gathering people together, bring other artists&#8217; and writers&#8217; work 
        into form. That becomes its own community, which can then open into a 
        wider community. It&#8217;s the difference between an individual act and a collective 
        act. I don&#8217;t know that I believe those are totally separate, but there 
        is a difference there that&#8217;s striking.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Distribution 
        is where the web becomes an interesting practice, because it&#8217;s all about 
        the ability to distribute on an incredibly wide scale. I don&#8217;t know how 
        it would actually work; I&#8217;ve never really wanted to view work on the web. 
        I know there must be wonderful work there, but I haven&#8217;t been drawn to 
        it. I don&#8217;t want to encounter a screen; it&#8217;s always going to be the same 
        material. It&#8217;s an issue of translation. What gets transferred if you&#8217;re 
        scanning work with rocks and twigs? Is it a translation that carries enough 
        of an original?</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There&#8217;s 
        a quote from Susan Sontag in which she says a photograph is not only an 
        image but also, &#8220;a trace, something directly stenciled off the real, like 
        a footprint, or a death mask.&#8221; The light has touched what has been seen. 
        A scan &#8212; is it the same thing? If I&#8217;m looking at an object on the web, 
        it&#8217;s a trace of a trace, it&#8217;s not the imprint of something that&#8217;s directly 
        stenciled off the real. If you take a photograph, you are limited by what 
        the material is and by what is being transfigured or seen. But if you&#8217;re 
        working in Photoshop and moving the pixils around, you&#8217;ve left the sensory 
        world.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        do a lot of work on the computer; I hate it. My body does not feel happy. 
        I was very conflicted with video. I very much needed to make a piece that 
        could put together movement, image, color, text, but I hated the process, 
        the queuing up, the editing, the equipment &#8212; hours and hours of activity 
        that I didn&#8217;t love. To me, that&#8217;s the worst direction in making art. Everything 
        counts when you&#8217;re making a piece, every gesture; when you&#8217;re polishing, 
        sanding: that&#8217;s the work, that&#8217;s part of the piece as well. Something 
        about the electronic or digital process is distancing for me. I&#8217;m making 
        a split, a deal, between what I want to end up with and what I&#8217;m going 
        to do to get there. But I&#8217;m sure that other people must find pleasure 
        in the process.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        write with fountain pen, ink, paper; I have to see the writing first as 
        a drawing. It&#8217;s the spaces that happen, the way the ink moves, how it 
        feels when I&#8217;m making &#8212; because I&#8217;m not &#8220;thinking&#8221; the words, they&#8217;re 
        being made or found on the paper. If I&#8217;m making a drawing, I&#8217;m making 
        marks and that&#8217;s how I discover what I&#8217;m drawing. Every mark you make, 
        every blot that happens is talking back to you. Everything tells you something 
        about it. When thinking is not separated from your senses, it&#8217;s coming 
        from your own necessities.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        think the words come first usually, but I can&#8217;t guarantee that always 
        works. There are a whole series of writings that I&#8217;ve made from paintings. 
        I found when I started working in oil paint that the paint was incredibly 
        noisy, it was talking to me. I was reading H.D. at the time and the paint 
        was telling me all about H.D.; those paintings became a part of my thinking 
        about her, it was very informative. Sometimes I think the writing comes 
        from something that would originally have no language at all &#8212; sanding, 
        constructing, painting, working with my friend who is a dancer, going 
        for walks.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
        I was 18 or 19 and very drawn to Woolf&#8217;s writing, the idea of the press 
        always struck me, before I ever thought of making books; the idea that 
        if you&#8217;re writing, you need to do something else besides sit. I couldn&#8217;t 
        stand the idea of only staying in your mind; it seemed vital to me and 
        to my own survival to handle things. For me it was always the idea that 
        Woolf was there wrapping these books: the labor that was required, the 
        repetition, lost in language, seemed crucial. I came across a little Hogarth 
        book in the library at Iowa on the shelf and I just about fainted it was 
        so beautiful. Little maroon binding, black and white speckled.</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When 
        you make a letterpress book on your printing press, it&#8217;s like you are 
        getting run through the press, printed and being changed with each run, 
        your being is connected with each run and being printed. The way the type 
        goes into the paper is happening to you. Then there&#8217;s the attention paid 
        to how do you open the book, what do you first encounter, how does it 
        feel, what are the colors, how does that connect with the text or images? 
        Some of that must transfer when someone handles it. It can&#8217;t not. It&#8217;s 
        so imbued. Maybe that&#8217;s part of the pressing over and over and over again. 
        Why is it necessary? Is it like chant or repeated prayer?</font></p>
      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
        think that&#8217;s one of the things that handmade books or any kind of beautifully 
        made book does. Whether it&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s meant to be read or a book 
        that&#8217;s meant to be experienced &#8212; you&#8217;re engaged, absorbed, you move from 
        page to page. There&#8217;s something that happens when someone gives you a 
        physical, material form that &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why, but I keep thinking that 
        it&#8217;s been loved. It&#8217;s so dense, so touched, so handled, so made. The attention 
        of the making. What happens when we don&#8217;t care about what we handle or 
        touch anymore? What happens when we have things that are indifferent and 
        just get the job done?</font></p>
