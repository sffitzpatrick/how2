But         the books are really my big love, because theyre intimate and personal         and interactive in a way the other work isnt as much. I really like to         write even though I dont consider myself a writer; I like puns, the multiple         meanings and associations of words, how words sound. Im doing word assemblage.         I make assemblage sculpture and thats what I do with words. I put unlikely         words together and thats how I create other stories.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ive         been making books since 1991. My primary source for art supplies is the         flea market; Im intrigued by other peoples detritus. At some point I         started using other peoples cast off words. I would take parts of books         and cut them up and juxtapose them with parts of other books, such as         a sex manual with a hunting guide. Writing in this way, I came up with         lots of surprises that I wouldnt necessarily have come up with on my         own.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         themes of my work have to do with sexuality, history, Jewish identity,         challenging the status quo, class, economics. I try to take these serious         issues with as much levity as I can. I hate work thats didactic, but         I also always want to take jabs at the system, the inhuman forms of existence         that we all are forced to live unde<span style='font-size:12.0pt'>r.</span></font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There         are a number of ways I work. One is to delete parts of a text and leave         words in that form a completely different text, one that usually subverts         the original. Thats the case with <i>That Two-Edged Bliss</i>, which         came from a book called<i>, When Knighthood Was in Flower.</i> I delete         text in many different ways: covering it with strips of money, cutting         it with an exacto-knife, sewing it out, taping it out; I use all sorts         of methods to hide or partially hide original text and let other words         come out.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>That         Two-Edged Bliss</i> is one of a number of pieces that Ive done about         being bisexual and how a lot of people have a difficult time with that         because its not one or the other; its both/and not either/or. I got         this weird old book and started picking it apart, taking out large amounts         of text and leaving certain words. I found images from various sources          old encyclopedias, womens magazines from the 1950s, sewing books,         religious and historical photographs  and paired them with the pages         in an intuitive way. I just gravitate to certain images. I pair them if         my gut tells me to; I try to go with that without thinking too much about         it.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Another         way I work is to cut out phrases from one book, or sometimes more than         one.  In the case of <i>Selections from Mein Kampf</i>, I had a copy from         the flea market. I didnt know what I was going to do with it but I knew         I had to have it, because how often do you come across a copy of <i>Mein         Kampf</i> from the 1940s?  It sat around in my studio for several years         emitting toxic rays. One day I just had it cut up into several pieces.         I ended up making four books out of it. In one, I burnt out text; in another,         I covered text with strips of Hebrew writing; in a third, I used a tape         transfer method to obliterate parts of the text. On the one shown here,         I tore out phrases from the original and reassembled them to make poems         in which Hitler expresses remorse and contradictory feelings about what         he has done. I sewed them together onto pieces of a Hebrew prayer book         that Id found in a second hand store in a state of complete disrepair          I felt guilty about using it but it was already falling apart.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Sewing         plays a very important role in my work. My background is in textiles.         My parents were upholsterers; I grew up around fabric and thread and needles         and learned how to sew at an early age. In my sculpture I use sewing as         a way of drawing, of creating line. In books, its a way of integrating         text from different sources. I find zig-zag a great way of making the         transition between different kinds of paper; it makes the page more of         an integrated whole rather than one paper stuck on another. Plus, I really         like sewing things that are not normally sewn; I sew everything from paper         to wood to metal. I like its associations with domestic, traditionally         womens work and craft and using that in my art. </font></p>      <hr>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Livres         de Po&egrave;tes:</b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>         Emily McVarish<a name="mcvarish"> </a></b></font></p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td>             <div align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-style:normal'><a href="../../bookart/pages/atwheel_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/atwheel_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="160" border="0"></a><br>              </span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At               the Wheel&quot; <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </font></div>          </td>          <td>             <div align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-style:normal'><a href="../../bookart/pages/Capital-D_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/Capital-D_jpg.jpg" width="142" height="200" border="0"></a><br>              </span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lives               and Property&quot;<br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </font></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ive         been really interested in the three-dimensional and mechanical aspects         of reading and poetics. Conventional books pretty much have one way they         work mechanically; they do have a third dimension, but the two-dimensional         page is more central. Most of the work Ive done has been sculptural,         oftentimes with more than one mechanical feature. Some of these pieces         emphasize one feature of a book, say the turning of a page as a repetitive         motion, while limiting other graphic possibilities. Theres an exaggeration         of the object status of the book. Using found objects in the sculptures         has given me so much to go on conceptually and in terms of design incidents;         there was an immediate dialogue with those objects that helped me to figure         out how to structure a book. With found objects, their material history         has been immediately apparent. The interplay between that and the text         has been accessible to me and the viewer. Im now trying to work with         conventional forms or formats, both graphical and structural, as being         in some way found  a shift from an actual old object to something slightly         more abstract  but trying to take on the convention in the same critical         (in the sense of exploratory) way.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         think the sculptures were my way into books; I was hesitant to take on         the conventional book format and was more interested in figuring out what         about that format drew me, by playing out different aspects of that. Now         that Im figuring out what those single factors were, Im getting up the         courage to face the conventional book.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         have also made catalogs that accompanied and documented exhibitions of         the sculptures. They contain all the texts that were incorporated in the         sculptures, yet have their own being. The emphasis of the show, an ephemeral         event, was on fragmentation and dissemination. Say I wrote a text and         paired it with six linotype draw<i>e</i>rs. That text might then be divided         into six parts; each drawer would become one chapter in the text. The         exhibition was the event where you would see the whole thing, but I would         sell the six pieces separately: the ultimate fate of those objects was         to get pulled off in bits. The catalog was a concession of a not quite         admitted desire on my part for the text to have some endurance; it grouped         and kept it whole; in that way it was a lot more like a traditional book.         At that point, the traditional book form couldnt satisfy the more radical         interest to have things more temporary, more contingent on context, that         the shows provided for me. Its only now that Im trying to figure out         how a book might less have that pretense to being permanent and whole.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         texts are almost all the product of the process of cutting up existing         texts and recomposing them. It starts with choosing a few books that interest         me and trying to scan, not really read, the texts, like an airplane going         over a landscape. I cut them out and have a whole system of arranging         those bits.  If I already know theres going to be a theme that Im writing         about, I might arrange according to that theme; but usually the arrangements         grammatical. This method of composition is a way of creating a dialogue         between me and these bits of text rather than trying to find something         within my head without that kind of prompt. Its definitely influenced         by surrealist and automatic writing and other kinds of rule-based and         chance composition, but Im not that systematic; its not about demonstrating         something by pure experiment, its just a way for me to write. The bits         that Ive cut out have gotten smaller and smaller; basically, theyre         single words now, whereas when I started out, they would be whole sentences,         citations of whole thoughts. There has been a real continuity between         that process of writing and the next step of setting type  and the found         objects, which would determine everything from the structure of the piece         to the size of the edition. I used to work with multiple determinations:         for every step, every decision, I would make sure I had material determinations         to work with. Now thats changing somewhat. I dont necessarily work with         type and Im doing less found object work. But the texts themselves still         come out of a material, concrete, exchange with words.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>At         the wheel </i>is part of a series of texts, included in the exhibition         and catalog <i>Wards of Obsolescence, </i>that I wrote under the influence         of Walter Benjamins <i>The</i> <i>Arcades Project</i>. <i>The</i> <i>Arcades         Project</i> is the hidden center of Benjamins entire oeuvre, a thousand         pages of notes, fragments, quotations, citations, about the arcades of         Paris as the perfect 19<sup>th</sup> century construct. The arcades were         a favorite image for surrealist writers; they held a ghost or aquarium         feeling, because they were already dead by the beginning of the twentieth         century; Benjamin saw them as greenhouses for 19<sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt'>th</span></sup>         century dream images. This year, <i>The Arcades Project </i>has finally         been translated into English; I had for years had the French translation.         Its been for me an infinitely inspiring source, including the whole series         of texts that <i>At the wheel</i> came from. I tried to take Benjamin         literally: he was saying we could make a critical history out of the stuff         itself. I thought I would take old stuff and make the books out of that,         using objects the way he regards them, as being revelatory about the implications         of the history that they carry. I took certain images as evocations of         modernity. <i>At the wheel</i> is the image of the ferris wheel  waiting         in line, getting on the wheel, entertainment  used to discuss the Benjaminian         idea of popular culture presenting pseudo-satisfactions of what are essentially         utopian dreams.  Its about waiting for technology to give us what can         only come from social change.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The         presence of the human figure in the <i>Wards of Obsolescence</i> series         was on the level of society; I had been thinking about the writing of         history. Then I thought, what happens where existential and historical         time meet? A quote by Siegfried Kracauer, The flight of images is the         flight from the revolution and death, was the beginning of <i>Lives and         Property</i> for me. Kracauer was saying that the onslaught of the visual         in modern society not only keeps us from seeing real economic conditions         but also has an individual existential influence of keeping us from contemplating         our own death. Where do the social and societal and political intersect         with individual existence and the things  including death  that determine         and define individual existence? <i>Lives and Property </i>is an exploration         of that intersection. Death is in the middle of that text; the whole piece         is like a tombstone; everything about it is dark and dense, gray and closed         onto itself. The title refers to the way those things are counted and         named on an historical level: the damage of major conflicts, for example,         is counted in terms of lives and property. The piece looks at the relationship         between existence viewed from that historical point-of-view and existence         viewed from the first person point-of-view back up at history.</font></p>      <hr>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Livres         de Po&egrave;tes:</b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>         Denise Newman<a name="newman"> </a></b></font></p>      <table width="60%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" align="center">        <tr>           <td valign="top">             <p align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/IWasGood_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/IWasGood_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="148" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kafka's               Grave&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </p>          </td>          <td valign="top">             <div align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/TheBulbExplodes_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/TheBulbExplodes_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="145" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Opera for               Two...you and who?&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         began making books over a series of summers spent writing on the Danish         island of Bornholm. Most of my books are tiny </font>handwritten narratives         illustrated with drawings, watercolors or photographs in purchased blank         pocket notebooks. Im not so interested in constructing the book itself;         Id rather find a blank book ready-made and fill it. I made these books         because, on Bornholm, Id have a lot of time and wanted to do something         other than writing. So I decided to illustrate some of my work; it was         a good way to bring together my drawing and painting and writing. I nearly         always began with the poem or story first.</p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         just dont have that kind of time now, as I did on Bornholm<i>. </i>Since         those summers, most of my books are made as gifts because its the only         time Ill give myself to do it. <i>The Brilliant Poet Series</i> was made         that way, four books written as an appreciation of the work of poet-friends         that I gave each of them as presents. Others are more private, only to         be read by the persons they were made for.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         see the small books as puppet theaters. The book is the stage, the pictures         are the puppets and scenery, and the text is the story. Making these books         is an efficient way to have my poems and stories performed  albeit, without         the impact of a whole room, though I like the intimacy of someone holding         the theater in her hands and watching it in private, at her own pace.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         said puppet theater because it is miniature, which Im very drawn to 限         the mock version of the real stage. With theater, I have trouble suspending         my disbelief. I can more easily enter opera, which is so false, or puppet         theater, and become totally absorbed by it.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Theres         a beautiful small cathedral in the city here thats a miniature of a grand         cathedral; it has all the parts, but on a human scale; its elegant.          I feel very much more comfortable there than in a huge cathedral. </font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As         a child, I made things for myself, for my own pleasure, and these books         are made with that freedom. They werent made for anyone else to see,         except maybe close friends. The poems in the books are written in that         way also: none of them have been published elsewhere; they have no other         life outside these books.</font></p> <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         a few cases, I didnt begin with a completed text but wrote and illustrated         the book as I went along. I dont feel theyre as good. There are parts         that I like, but Id run out of ideas, Id run out of juice, and so its         spotty. It works better when I have the text and then I look for images         that will provide the appropriate atmosphere. With <i>Kafkas Grave</i>,         I let the pictures tell the story. I started out with the images, and         did write it as I was making it. But with <i>Opera for Twoyou and who?,         Pearls Are Passing, </i>and<i> It, </i>I started with the text.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         found many of these images in art books, altering masterpieces to go with         my stories. Copying masterpieces is a great way to experience them. Often         the pictures are creating a tension with the words rather than illustrating         them.  For example, theres a watercolor in <i>Pearls Are Passing</i>         of a man and a woman hanging by their legs over a cauldron, while the         text is something tender about love. </font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Theres         such joy in making these books, like playing.

When I took my first letterpress         class, I was completely enchanted by the typography, the ink, the type,         the smell of the ink, the feel of the paper, and the sounds of the machines.         I wanted to make a book that had a classical design, in terms of its proportions,         with crisp typography and lots of space on the page, so that the words         would come out at you. The structure of the book usually preceded the         writing of it. The size of the page, for example, greatly influenced the         writing; a long page is not the same as an 8-1/2&quot; by 11&quot; sheet         of paper. Everything that goes into the making of a book affects it.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With         <i>Fugitive,</i> my first letterpress book, I fit the writing into a very         strict, square form of 4 inches by 4 inches, using 4 sections of 4 pages,         each page with 4 stanzas of 4 couplets. I like to work in form, though         usually I find the form as I write. Once that happens, then I know I'm         moving in the right direction; the form helps to bring the whole together.         With <i>Fugitive</i>, the pattern was so strict that I wanted to break         with it, set it free. First there's one page that has five stanzas instead         of four. Then on another page I shifted from letterpress altogether and         hand-wrote the page in each book. I'm not quite sure how that came about.         Perhaps it's because of one of the lines on that page; it reads: &quot;In         America/space haunts, not architecture.&quot; The book, with its form,         is very architectural and the line is about a transition toward a dissimilar         place, a &quot;rupture from Europe.&quot; And that may have inspired me.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">About         the same time, a friend and I began making one-of-a-kind books for each         other. Making these books was exciting for their immediacy. I could use         all kinds of materials that I couldn't use in letterpress, and the methods         were definitely a lot quicker. This exchange between the two of us became         a kind of dialogue, different from ordinary speech, like an exchange of         poems. We were making the books as gifts, as a way of creating something         just for the other person. A private gesture, as well as playful. Meanwhile,         I went on to print and design two more letterpress books, <i>Artist As         A Young Woman</i> and <i>In The Bed Of The Press</i>.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">My         most recent one-of-a-kind books are handwritten with an antique Ladies'         Shaeffer fountain pen and illustrated with found photographs. The first         in the series, <i>A Botanist's Dream</i>, is about my grandfather, who         worked as a botanist at the Smithsonian into his 90's. After my grandfather         died, I was helping my mother sort through his things and came upon photographs         that were left unidentified. My mother was prepared to throw them away,         so I asked her to let me have them instead. One day I must have been thinking         again about making books. I took some paper and folded it and bound it         in a binding that I liked. I brought out the photographs. They were so         rich and interesting that it was quite easy to make connections and write         the book  a connection between a photograph and thinking of my grandfather,         a photograph and the feel of the ink pen scratching the surface of paper.         I really enjoyed the process of working with photographs; they helped         me find a direction for what I had to say.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         still have a book in this series that is partially completed. I've imagined         it, but I haven't written it; it's just kind of waiting. It's inspired         by a phrase in Keith Waldrop's poem, &quot;Poet&quot;: &quot;I build houses         that I will not inhabit.&quot; I found that very haunting. Not inhabiting.         It seems appropriate with books because once you've made them, they're         out there, separate from you. Somehow the handwritten books, because they're         more personal, because they're one-of-a-kind, maybe because they are handwritten         and not the printed page, still have a quality of intimacy.</font></p>      <p class=bodytextindent style='line-height:18.0pt'></p>      <hr>      <p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Livres         de Po&egrave;tes:</b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>         Jaime Robles <a name="robles"> </a></b></font></p>      <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" align="center">        <tr>           <td valign="top">             <div align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/Book_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/Book_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="144" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Chance               Meeting on a Train&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </div>          </td>          <td valign="top">             <div align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/ThreePages_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/ThreePages_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="142" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Edna's               Death&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="../../photos/jaime-robles.jpg" width="160" height="213" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">I         started working with books when I was fairly young; in college I majored         in both English and art. Although I liked doing artwork, I didnt like         the unique aspect; I was too attached to what I was doing. One of my original         attractions to printing was that not only could I combine art and words         but I could make multiples. I saw a show of work by students who were         printing pieces with both image and text; I asked one of them to show         me how to use the letterpress and made my first piece, a translation of         a St. Theresa of Avila poem with an etching.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After         college Kathy Walkup, Cheryl Miller and I started Five Trees Press. We         published several letterpress books, including poetry by H.D. and Denise         Levertov. Ive worked in one capacity or another in graphics and book         design and editorial for thirty years now. At one point, I worked for         the artist Sam Francis, running his letterpress shop, The Lapis Press,         where I edited book projects with writers Michael Palmer, Kathleen Fraser,         and Bruce Boone, among others. Working with them helped me decide to take         my own writing more seriously. I entered the writing program at San Francisco         State, and Ive been plugging along since.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         dont know how I decide to do a particular book; I just take a fancy to         whatever it happens to be. Before I make the actual book, I have the writing,         or an idea of writing. But I like to have books evolve rather than be         planned out, as they have to be in my trade book work.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Chance         Meeting on a Train</i>, for example, is an evolved book. I positioned         printing plates in different ways and made monoprints, so that I had a         group of page spreads. For the text, I randomly circled phrases on a newspaper         page without looking, then shuffled the phrases together. I folded the         monoprinted pages, put them in an order and printed the random/found text         on them. I made an edition of three, but theyre each unique in that theyre         different monoprints.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ive         done a series of journal books that originated in on-going journal events         and existed as mail art pieces before they became books. One of these         is <i>Ednas Death</i>, which I made when I was living with my grandmother         while she was dying. I felt so alienated from everybody; I couldnt really         communicate that, it was tediously boring.  So I decided to make a mail         art piece in which, once a week, I would send something about this experience.         Some of the pieces are poems about exchanges between my grandmother and         me. Ones a note that I found about a story she tells of a friend of hers         thats in the hospital. Ones a photograph of a parking meter outside         the mortuary   theyve put a bag over the head of the meter that says         Funeral. It seemed so appropriate that there was this obliterated time.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some         things look better in letterpress and some things look better in photocopy.         With <i>Ednas Death,</i> I liked using photocopies and a typewriter face         because it had that more casual, this-is-happening-everyday look; it didnt         look worked.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         find myself drawn to making works that are both visual and verbal because         I think both are necessary to give fullness to whatever it is that Im         trying to express. Theyre really two expressions of the world, and they         dont overlap. But when both are present, something about the interaction         transmutes the two into a third thing. So, say we have this bottle on         the table. And say I write something about it. That verbal expression         of the bottle captures a certain kind of essence about the bottle; its         an intellectualized thing. But if I draw the bottle, its an expression         that is radically different from the verbal. Theyre not illustrations         of each other  theyre absolutely not illustrations of each other.  I         have to say I think the visual is more intuitive, but its not simply         about feeling. I would say that feeling is a third expression, permeating         the presence of both the verbal and visual. Im not rating these in a         hierarchy. Im not saying that the combination is better or more effective         than verbal or visual solely. Thats not the case. Its that you have         three little worlds on a plate, three different forms of expression. I         think thats right. I think thats at the moment how it looks. </font></p>      <hr>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Livres         de Po&egrave;tes:</b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>         Meredith Stricker <a name="stricker"> </a></b></font></p>      <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" align="center">        <tr>           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/Mother_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/Mother_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="144" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Prairie               of the Imagination&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </div>          </td>          <td>             <div align="center"><a href="../../bookart/pages/TwoPaintings_jpg.htm"><img src="../../bookart/thumbnails/TwoPaintings_jpg.jpg" width="200" height="145" border="0"></a><br>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The H.D.               Exchange&quot;</font> <br>              <img src="../click.gif" width="125" height="35"> </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thinking         about my own history of writing, it has become clear to me that its not         that there was poetry and then there were books; the materials and the         objects <i>were</i> the poetry. When Im writing its not necessarily         to communicate, its to make something. Certain things can only exist         in the form youre making; you can see things, you can understand things         that cant exist in any other way. The issue of making the things comes         first; you cant think about your audience. With artists books, if Im         making something with sticks and mud, I dont worry about how will it         be sent in the mail or how someone will carry it. I dont think about         how people are going to wrap up their merchandise; its not a primary         concern. For me, I was just busy wrapping books with gauze and sticking         plasterI was literally bandaging books because they looked so beautiful.         I would do this with books I didnt make, people like Mishima whom I found         difficult or disturbing. I thought, this would work better, making an         object beautiful or magical, so you could see it like a rattle or talisman         but wouldnt have to literally traipse through each one.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For         other book artists, the wonderful thing would be realizing material into         the world. Cecilia Vicuna would leave little books made with sticks, writing,         thread, all over New York  theyd be distributed by peoples chancing         upon them. One of the most exciting things that happens with a book is         that people can read it or find it or exchange it. The idea of being able         to make multiples and put the book into distribution  artists can crack         open the censorship of the market, the barriers to what gets published.         An artists book can say, when normal presses arent going to take on         this material: This can be read or seen by others.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Looking         at the continuum of people working with artists books, my own process         is way on the end of one of a kind; not just because they are one of a         kind but because I dont get around to thinking,  How do I make a thousand?         How do I send this out in the world?  I am thinking of making a poetics.         Theres a difference between making artists books that are within ones         own realm of writing or practice, and having a press: with the press,         youre gathering people together, bring other artists and writers work         into form. That becomes its own community, which can then open into a         wider community. Its the difference between an individual act and a collective         act. I dont know that I believe those are totally separate, but there         is a difference there thats striking.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Distribution         is where the web becomes an interesting practice, because its all about         the ability to distribute on an incredibly wide scale. I dont know how         it would actually work; Ive never really wanted to view work on the web.         I know there must be wonderful work there, but I havent been drawn to         it. I dont want to encounter a screen; its always going to be the same         material. Its an issue of translation. What gets transferred if youre         scanning work with rocks and twigs? Is it a translation that carries enough         of an original?</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Theres         a quote from Susan Sontag in which she says a photograph is not only an         image but also, a trace, something directly stenciled off the real, like         a footprint, or a death mask. The light has touched what has been seen.         A scan  is it the same thing? If Im looking at an object on the web,         its a trace of a trace, its not the imprint of something thats directly         stenciled off the real. If you take a photograph, you are limited by what         the material is and by what is being transfigured or seen. But if youre         working in Photoshop and moving the pixils around, youve left the sensory         world.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         do a lot of work on the computer; I hate it. My body does not feel happy.         I was very conflicted with video. I very much needed to make a piece that         could put together movement, image, color, text, but I hated the process,         the queuing up, the editing, the equipment  hours and hours of activity         that I didnt love. To me, thats the worst direction in making art. Everything         counts when youre making a piece, every gesture; when youre polishing,         sanding: thats the work, thats part of the piece as well. Something         about the electronic or digital process is distancing for me. Im making         a split, a deal, between what I want to end up with and what Im going         to do to get there. But Im sure that other people must find pleasure         in the process.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         write with fountain pen, ink, paper; I have to see the writing first as         a drawing. Its the spaces that happen, the way the ink moves, how it         feels when Im making  because Im not thinking the words, theyre         being made or found on the paper. If Im making a drawing, Im making         marks and thats how I discover what Im drawing. Every mark you make,         every blot that happens is talking back to you. Everything tells you something         about it. When thinking is not separated from your senses, its coming         from your own necessities.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         think the words come first usually, but I cant guarantee that always         works. There are a whole series of writings that Ive made from paintings.         I found when I started working in oil paint that the paint was incredibly         noisy, it was talking to me. I was reading H.D. at the time and the paint         was telling me all about H.D.; those paintings became a part of my thinking         about her, it was very informative. Sometimes I think the writing comes         from something that would originally have no language at all  sanding,         constructing, painting, working with my friend who is a dancer, going         for walks.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When         I was 18 or 19 and very drawn to Woolfs writing, the idea of the press         always struck me, before I ever thought of making books; the idea that         if youre writing, you need to do something else besides sit. I couldnt         stand the idea of only staying in your mind; it seemed vital to me and         to my own survival to handle things. For me it was always the idea that         Woolf was there wrapping these books: the labor that was required, the         repetition, lost in language, seemed crucial. I came across a little Hogarth         book in the library at Iowa on the shelf and I just about fainted it was         so beautiful. Little maroon binding, black and white speckled.</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When         you make a letterpress book on your printing press, its like you are         getting run through the press, printed and being changed with each run,         your being is connected with each run and being printed. The way the type         goes into the paper is happening to you. Then theres the attention paid         to how do you open the book, what do you first encounter, how does it         feel, what are the colors, how does that connect with the text or images?         Some of that must transfer when someone handles it. It cant not. Its         so imbued. Maybe thats part of the pressing over and over and over again.         Why is it necessary? Is it like chant or repeated prayer?</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I         think thats one of the things that handmade books or any kind of beautifully         made book does. Whether its a book thats meant to be read or a book         thats meant to be experienced  youre engaged, absorbed, you move from         page to page. Theres something that happens when someone gives you a         physical, material form that  I dont know why, but I keep thinking that         its been loved. Its so dense, so touched, so handled, so made. The attention         of the making. What happens when we dont care about what we handle or         touch anymore? What happens when we have things that are indifferent and         just get the job done?</font></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'></p>      <p style='line-height:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="index.html">alerts</a>         </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="../index.html">table         of contents</a> </font></p>      <hr>      <p>        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="432" height="54">          <param name="movie" value="../../../../Images/navbar.swf">          <param name="quality" value="high">          <embed src="../../../../Images/navbar.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="432" height="54"></embed>        </object>      </p>    </td>  </tr>    <tr>     <td width="86" height="1" valign="top"><img width="86" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="14" height="1" valign="top"><img width="14" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="1" height="1" valign="top"><img width="1" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="72" height="1" valign="top"><img width="72" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="63" height="1" valign="top"><img width="17" height="1" src="../../graphics/transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
