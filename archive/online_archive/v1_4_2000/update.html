Was she working alone         or striving with comrades to build an archive for future times? How was         this legacy taken up or modified by other writers, artists, critics, feminists         and social activists, then and later? What are the "wider boundaries of         daring" envisioned and created by the work of Modernist women poets of         Canada? What issues does retrieval of this past raise for literary history,         for feminist theory? These are some of the questions to be addressed in         a conference that will focus on the important contribution of Dorothy         Livesay, P.K. Page, Miriam Waddington, Margaret Avison, Jay MacPherson,         Elizabeth Smart, Phyllis Webb, and other lesser known poets of their generations         such as Doris Ferne, Floris McLaren, Anne Marriott, Kay Smith, Elizabeth         Brewster, to Canadian literature and society. </font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Modernism         is a fraught issue in Canadian literature criticism. Robert Kroetsch once         announced that Canadian literature passed straight from Victorianism to         Postmodernism with nothing in between, thereby contributing to a marked         decline in scholarly attention to the Modernist period since the 1980s.         Poststructuralist and postcolonial studies in the last decades have tended         to privilege narrative at the expense of poetry. Focus on the troubled         relationship of feminism and postmodernism has contributed to the neglect         of contemporary women writers' legacy from their Modernist predecessors.         A festival of readings by several generations of women poets will address         this question through performance and dialogue. We wish to celebrate the         "wider boundaries of daring" Modernist women poets envisioned and created         for women artists who came after and the wide-ranging artistic affiliations         and inter-media connections they established. </font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Critically,         the conference will supplement existing scholarship on Modernist poetry         in Canada that has been primarily the work of poets, collecting manifestoes,         identifying little magazines and other avant-garde sites of diffusion,         writing biographies. A critical gap has emerged recently as the first         outlines of a more general narrative of Canadian Modernism have been sketched         with a decidedly masculinist cast (Gnarowski, Trehearne, Kizuk). Only         the rare token woman figures in these studies as practitioner of an aesthetic         to be surpassed on the way to greater artistic heights. Additionally,         this narrative posits Canadian modernism as derivative of British and         American experiments. Elsewhere, though, a rethinking of Modernism through         the lens of gender has greatly expanded the number of texts and the formal         range of rejections of tradition, as well as enlarging the connecting         strands of association between modernists so as to displace the canon         from a few masters. One thinks of the work of Bonnie Kime Scott who includes         women writers of the of the Harlem Renaissance in The Gender of Modernism;         of Whitney Chadwick in Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement and Georgiana         Colvile in La Femme s'entte who show how Surrealism only appeared to objectify         the feminine, proving rather to be an enabling aesthetic for many women         painters and writers. Closer to home, Patricia Smart's ground-breaking         study of Quebec women artists, Les femmes du Refus Global, suggests they         were written out of the history of the Automatiste movement because still         working today, in a variety of media, their artmaking exceeds the aesthetic         of that particular moment with which critics identified the group.</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In         a similar revisionary spirit, we propose to analyze the contribution of         women poets to the development of Modernism in Canada, in all its facets         and in as wide a context as possible. One of the enduring myths of Modernism,         with a powerful hold in the Canadian context, posits an opposition between         formalist aestheticism and socio-political engagement. Yet these women         writers pursued both projects; as teachers, editors, publishers, activists,         they did much to build the literary institution in Canada, creating examples         and opportunities for younger writers. We are therefore interested in         contributions that examine their roles as public intellectuals and/or         social activists as well as artists.</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> To         this end we invite analyses of their political drama, reportage, reviews,         criticism, speeches and life-writing, as well as the fiction and poetry         for which they are primarily celebrated. What affiliations did they establish         with their predecessors? With artists in other media? How has the next         generation responded to/benefitted from their initiatives? What questions         do these connections pose for periodization and historiography in the         literary critical context? We also invite contributions that analyze their         relationship implicit or explicit to international aesthetic and social         movements, and translation of their work into different languages, including         those of sound and visual image.</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Please         send a proposal of 200 words along with a brief CV by December 15th, 2000</font></p>      <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Barbara         Godard, 350 Stong, York University, 4700 Keele St., North York, Ontario,         M3J 1P3.

Past topics have included gender and editing,         documentary, mixed media and hybrid genres, processes and procedures,         and different languages. The topic allows Chain's editors to switch the         editorial question that they ask of each piece of work submitted--from         "Is this a great piece of art?" to "Does this piece of art tell us something         about the topic that we didn't otherwise know?".

In the mid-1980's Kelsey St.         initiated a unique series of collaborations between visual artists and         poets. Believing that poets and visual artists should talk to each other,         the Press coordinates collaborations and then documents the results.Kelsey         St. Press supports the work of innovative writers whose work has been         disregarded by large, for-profit publishers. Just as New Directions championed         early 20th century innovators Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams,         Kelsey St. Press has published late 20th century innovators Mei-mei Berssenbrugge,         Kathleen Fraser, Barbara Guest, Myung Mi Kim and Erica Hunt. A partial         list of contemporary artist-collaborations include the work of Kiki Smith,         Alison Saar, Richard Tuttle and Anne Dunn. <br>        <br>        Kelsey Street Press <br>        50 Northgate Avenue<br>        Berkeley, CA. 94708<br>        Visit the Kelsey St. Press website: <a href="http://www.sirius.com/%7Ekelseyst/">http://www.sirius.com/~kelseyst/</a><br>        E-mail: <a href="mailto:kelseyst@sirius.com">kelseyst@sirius.com</a>.<br>        Information about our subscriber program is available upon request.</font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="3"><img src="graphics/ink_pen.gif" width="109" height="50"></font>       </p>      <div align="left">         <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>          <b>O Books</b><font color="#FF0000"><br>          5729 Clover Dr.<br>          Oakland, CA. 94618</font><br>          <br>          for a catalog, go to: <a href="http://www.obooks.com">www.obooks.com</a><br>          Editor, Leslie Scalapino<br>          [See "In Print", for individual titles]<br>          </font></p>        <p align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="graphics/ink_pen.gif" width="109" height="50"></font>         </p>        <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><br>          </b><br>          </font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Outlet           Magazine &amp; Double Lucy Books</b></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">PO Box           9013</font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Berkeley           CA 94709 USA</font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a href="http://users.lanminds.com/dblelucy">http://users.lanminds.com/dblelucy</a></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Outlet           Magazine</b></font></p>        <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Outlet           publishes poetry, fiction and criticism, loosely centered around a common           theme.
