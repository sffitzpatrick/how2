The multiplicity of the self, of experience,         of desire, speaking. And perhaps even God, or god-as-conscience. I am         thinking a lot about recovery of humanity, language, time, memory, the         body, the fusion of decay and rebirth in A.O.'s work. I like how at once         there is so much stillness and activity.

My sense is of a world which past identity         is more than identity but never leaves identity behind. Most apparently         there are the two most demanding and sensual identities of lesbian sex         and her particular black experience&#150;St Louis, her grandmother, food,         Curtis Mayfield&#150;there is also drug identity, political identity,         and that of the romantic, well then why stop there, the person of faith.         I see a cataloging of selves, romance, the city, the conceits of identity         and history as they have thus been constructed, and through the catalog         is a construction of a figure of some sort of majestic power, Whitmanesque,         also HD's statue.

The spiritual aspect that we've both made reference         to is pivotal. There are 12 steps and 12 apostles. There is ascension.         There are many types of baptisms, of blood, rain, tears, cum. There is         much rising and falling. She's seen many rise from baptismal waters and         remain exactly the same. How does one save oneself and remain the same?         With salvation often comes renunciation. That is one big tug of war here,         between speaking on experience, and release from it, giving this truth         to the air as a freedom-via-renunciation, and a positive appraisal of         experience, the romanticism of survival.<br>        <br>        <b>RL</b>: H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous talks about the writer as a walker,         and this too in your reference, the writer exiles herself, wanders, in         order to get to the word.
