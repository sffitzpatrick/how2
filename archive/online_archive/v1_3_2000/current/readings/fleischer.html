Moving from the early lyric of one to the early lyric of         the other, from the late fiction of the other to the late fiction of the         one, we follow a game of chess instrumented by one critic for two players,         or one reader for two writers. With her unfailing eye and ear for the         poetry in the text, Perloff demonstrates that Bachmann's and Bernhard's         relinquishment of lyric was not a relinquishment of poetry at all, but         rather its reinvention within the framework of prose narrative, which         in the case of Bachmann's <i>Malina</i> finds dramatic expression in the         broken "telephone sentences" tentatively offered by the "Ich" narrator         to her inaccessible lover, Ivan:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">1&#9;Hello.         Hello?</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2&#9;I,         who else then</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">3&#9;Yes,         of course, excuse</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">4&#9;How         am I?

We see that the "Ich" narrator, a well-known         but reclusive writer, and Ivan, who goes to work regularly on the Kaerntnerring         (Vienna's financial district) but at a mysteriously unspecified job, are         only comfortable with each other when engaged in that quintessential Wittgensteinian         activity, a game of chess, during which they drink whiskey and smoke a         lot of cigarettes. The portrait is sad and familiar.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In         the "Ich" narrator and Ivan's use of "telephone sentences" [<i>Telefonsaetze</i>],         "teaching sentences" [<i>Lehrsaetze</i>], "example sentences" [<i>Beispielsaetze</i>],         "the first little saying-nothing sentences" [<i>die ersten kleinen nichtssagenden         Saetze</i>], and so on, Bachmann plays on the double sense of <i>Satz</i>         in German, which means both sentence and proposition, welding a verbal         pun out of her dual interest in language and philosophy.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;But         Bachmann creates "phrasal poetry" in <i>Malina</i> within the prose form         as well. The "Ich" narrator, who suffers from disturbances of memory (in         this she is meant to stand for Austrians generally), has difficulty separating         in her mind a series of painful experiences. The first of these, "[t]he         first discovery [<i>Erkenntnis</i>] of pain," occurred when she was a         schoolgirl of six, and was slapped in the face by one of a couple of boys         slightly older than she: this happened on the Glan bridge. The second         occurred when she was a young woman of nineteen, and was kissed for the         first time at the beginning of the Sea promenade by the Woerthersee, only         to be left for a more sophisticated woman of thirty five. The third occurred         when she was older, and endured a painfully lonely birthday aboard an         oceanliner that made a policy of serving cake to all the passengers and         singing "happy birthday to you." This is how the phrasal building occurs         (in each case, the paragraphs are complete):</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;It             was on the Glan bridge.

In the first memory she is the object of physical         violence (a slap), in the second the object of emotional violence (a kiss,         only to be abandoned), in the third her aloneness becomes a public embarrassment         on the populated oceanliner (cake, birthday song).</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Pain         is the sharp edge by which Ingeborg Bachmann lays bare Austria's collective         social and psychological illnesses, including importantly in <i>Malina</i>         and the remainder of her unfinished <i>Todesarten Zyklus</i> [ways of         dying cycle] (<i>Der Fall Franza</i>, <i>Requiem fuer Fanny Goldmann</i>)         illnesses that have arisen from Austria's inability to come to terms with         its National Socialist past. As Bachmann makes clear in the second of         her two Wittgenstein essays, a radio essay written in 1953 and broadcast         the following year from Munich, "Sayable and Unsayable--Ludwig Wittgenstein's         Philosophy," illnesses are to be cured <i>by means of language</i>, a         belief that will define the poetics of <i>Malina</i>, as will be seen         further on:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;First             Speaker: And because language is a labyrinth of paths--as [Wittgenstein]             calls it somewhere else--philosophy must by means of language take             up the struggle against the bewitchment of our reason. It must destroy             castles in the air and lay bare the foundation of language, it must             be like therapy, because philosophical problems are illnesses which             must be cured.

These experiences are inscribed in the "Ich"         narrator's need to delimit the limits of her world, to remain enclosed         within her "Ungargassenland" (as she joyously calls it in a paean to Ivan,         who is Hungarian), bounded by Ivan's house at Ungargasse 9, hers at number         6, and the geographic anchor of the Stadtpark.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;There         are two other male figures who together with Ivan bind the "Ich" narrator         in a triangulation of pain. The ambiguous gender of the eponymous "Malina"         reinforces the suggestion that he, who lives with the "Ich" narrator at         Ungargasse 6, is an alter ego for her. According to the "Ich," Malina         does not live "so convulsive a life" as she, he doesn't "waste his time         on trivialities," worrying about his appearance, making himself late,         "stammering apologies," yet he is not irritated by her ways: even though         they can hardly overlook each other in the daily conduct of their lives,         he notices her or not as he pleases.

Ivan's mistreatment is circumscribed, a matter         of indifference toward a woman whose love he does not return, and his         status as a Hungarian places him somewhat at a distance from the shameful         period of Austrian National Socialism which is the dark, repressed history         of the other figures. <a href="#6"><kbd>(6)</kbd></a> But even though         Malina's ethnicity is ambiguous (he might be Slavic, he might be Slovenian),         his work as a government official (<i>Staatsbeamter der Klasse A</i>)         in the Austrian Army Museum, as well as his academic major, history, ties         him to the National Socialist period that haunts the dreams of the "Ich"         narrator throughout the shortest chapter of the novel, "The Third Man,"         <a href="#7"><kbd>(7)</kbd></a> which focusses on the National Socialist         father as her tormentor, completing the passage from the introductory         section of the novel quoted above, the one that alluded to a fugitive         "worst night":</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;[My             father] wears the blood-stained white butcher's apron in front of             a slaughterhouse at dawn, he wears the red executioner's cloak and             climbs the steps, he wears silver and black with black boots in front             of an electric barbed-wire fence, in front of a loading ramp, in a             watch tower, he wears his costume for the riding whips, for the shoulder             rifles, for the shot-in-the-neck pistols, in the worst night the costumes             are worn, blood-stained and horrible.</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <dir>         <dir><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;And?</font></p> </dir>      </dir>      <dir>         <dir><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;My         father, who does not have the voice of my father, asks from afar:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;And?</font></p></dir>      </dir>      <dir><dir><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;And             I say over a long distance, because we come ever farther apart and             farther apart and farther:</font></p></dir></dir>      <dir>         <dir>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;I         know who you are.</font></p></dir>       </dir>        <dir>         <dir> <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;I         have understood everything.

Here Bachmann exploits the etymology         of the word for incest in German, <i>Blutschande</i>, which literally         means "blood shame." The word <i>Blutschande</i> rivets etymologically         the senses in which the postwar generation has been shamed by heredity,         both by the historical legacy of their National Socialist parents and         by the racial legacy that ties them to the perpetrators of violence against         those whose blood was considered inferior or degenerate. Furthermore,         <i>Blutschande</i> is a word whose 'meaning in use' was perverted under         National Socialism, when it was used to designate not impermissible endogamy         (incest), but exogamy that was made impermissible by the Nuremberg laws         of 1935, interracial sexuality, or 'miscegenation.' <a href="#8"><kbd>(8)</kbd></a></font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Bachmann         employs phrasal echoes both in the passages that reveal the father as         incestor, and in the "Ich" narrator's declaration in the final line of         the novel: "<i>Es war Mord"</i> [It was murder]. In "The Third Man," the         narrator states that her mother knows everything, "<i>Blutschande, es         war Blutschande</i>" (M 188), and on the following page she breaks down,         hangs on her mother, and cries, "<i>ja, es war das, er war es, es war         Blutschande</i>" [yes, it was that, he was it, it was incest] (M 189),         an expressive chiasmus and catachresis of pronouns.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         long phrasal echo: "<i>es war Blutschande</i>" (M 188, 189), "<i>Es war         Mord</i>" (M 356), serves to hold up the two violations, incest and murder,         as equivalent in their emotional valence, in their shamefulness, in the         force of their repression. Such a reading is supported by the ways in         which the chapter "The Third Man" places the "Ich" narrator in the stead         of the victims of National Socialism, most pointedly in the first of the         dream sequences, in which the father attempts to gas her. There is then         a certain inevitability (in hindsight, at least) that it is her murder         which is recorded in the final line, <i>Es war Mord</i>, her final line.         Immediately prior to this stark ending, an ironic inversion of the murder         mystery format, which usually starts with the announcement of a murder         and works backward to seek its causes, the "Ich" narrator disappears into         a crack in the wall. From there she records Malina's disposal of her effects         (eye glasses, coffee cup, unfinished letters) and an overheard telephone         conversation in which he denies her very existence, a literal "<i>Vernichtung</i>"         [annihilation]. Yet she insists "<i>Es war nicht Malina</i>" [It was not         Malina] (M 354), which suggests that it was instead the father and all         that is associated with him (incest, National Socialism) that has murdered         her, in other words, that it is the not yet worked through past that is         the primary cause of her destruction, and the destructive relationships         with the men in her life, her lover and her alter ego, are secondary effects,         or to borrow Bachmann's medical metaphor, symptoms of an underlying illness         of history.</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;It         was during the immediate postwar years, the years of the Allied occupation         of Austria (1945-1955), that Ingeborg Bachmann wrote a dissertation at         the University of Vienna under the direction of the philosopher Victor         Kraft. (Her minor fields, not surprisingly, were psychology and German         studies.) Bachmann's thesis, which was accepted in January 1950, was entitled         "The Critical Reception of the Existential Philosophy of Martin Heidegger,"         a critique she apparently undertook in order to discredit Heidegger. As         Sara Lennox writes:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Later             interviews indicate that, in some contrast to the Heidegger enthusiasts             of the fifties, Bachmann took Heidegger's early support for the Nazis             seriously and was also prepared to connect his political opinions             to his philosophy. In a 1973 interview she declared that she had refused             to write a poem he had requested from her for the <i>Festschrift</i>             on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, and it was still with             some glee that she reported her certainty that her dissertation had             demolished his philosophy: "<i>Denn ich habe damals gemeint mit zweiundzwanzig             Jahren, diesen Mann werde ich jetzt stürzen</i>!"

He is quoted         only once in her dissertation, in the closing remarks, as Sigrid Weigel         explains:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;In             connection with the problem of justifying Heidegger's attempt to grasp             the realm of the inexpressible by rational means, described as the             "second science," [Bachmann] states: "The result will always be the             dangerous half rationalization of a sphere that can be touched with             one word from Wittgenstein: 'Of that which one cannot speak, one must             remain silent.'"

Sigrid Weigel points out that         in Bachmann's citation of the proposition here, written into the end of         her dissertation in 1949, Wittgenstein appears as "the mentor of a commandment         to silence" (H 93). But Bachmann's relationship to the proposition changed,         to a certain extent in response to her deeper understanding of Wittgenstein,         but also in response to what she needed to take from him. In the first         of her Wittgenstein essays, published in July 1953, Bachmann writes:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Not             the clarifying, negative propositions which restrict philosophy to             a logical analysis of scientific language, and leaves the investigation             of reality to the special fields of natural science, but his desperate             attempt to get at the unspeakable, which charges the <i>Tractatus</i>             with a tension in which he himself is sublated--therefore his failure             to attain a positive regulation of philosophy, which in the other             Neopositivists becomes a frightful ignorance--this is worth a renewed,             ever renewing, attention to his thought.<a href="#11"><kbd>(11)</kbd></a></font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It         is Wittgenstein's "desperate attempt to get at the unspeakable" that Bachmann         strove to emulate in her <i>Todesarten Zyklus</i>. It was in between her         first and her second Wittgenstein essays, probably in 1953, that Bachmann         read the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> for the first time. She may         not have read or thought through them very carefully at the time she wrote         the radio essay "Sayable and Unsayable," whose title already tells us         a lot about Bachmann's preoccupation in it. For instance, Bachmann glosses         over the fundamental differences in methodology and belief represented         in Wittgenstein's World War I and World War II works (the <i>Tractatus</i>         [1921] and the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> [1952], respectively).         Instead, she takes up in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> the threads         that had already interested her in the <i>Tractatus</i>, namely, the relationship         between philosophy, thinking, and especially language. More often than         not, the propositions she quotes argue for the power of language:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;"A             whole cloud of philosophy can be condensed to a drop of grammar [<i>Sprachlehre</i>]!"</font></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;"Language         itself is the vehicle for thinking."

We will see how one can "depict" the world in correct             and meaningful propositions, how we can "speak" about the world, and             what philosophy as critique of our speaking about the world can achieve.             (SuU&nbsp;107)</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In         addition to the critical dialectic suggested in the last line, it is Bachmann's         discovery that philosophical difficulties are "residing in language" that         is salient here. From here, I would like to suggest, she substitutes for         philosophical difficulties residing in language, collective social and         psychological difficulties, specifically those difficulties which are         the legacy of Austrian National Socialism and the Second World War. I         would furthermore like to suggest that even though she did not comment         on it directly (as far as I know), Bachmann apprehended and made internal         to the poetics of her <i>Todesarten Zyklus</i> an extended section of         language philosophy contained in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>,         Wittgenstein's skeptical consideration of the possibility of 'private         language' (sections 243-360).</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;It         is not possible in a short space to follow the numerous arrows of Wittgenstein's         criss-crossing research into the question of 'private language,' nor is         it possible to capture the mercurial quality of his quicksilver thought.         Briefly, though, he begins with a simple question:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>     <dir><dir> <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;Now         in what respect are my feelings <i>private</i>? (section 246)</font></p></dir></dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From         the beginning, pain is the feeling Wittgenstein uses to test the limits         of 'private language.' According to Wittgenstein, only I can know if I         am truly in pain, another person can only suspect it. What's more:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir><dir><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;The         other person cannot have my pain.

Here one might rewrite Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i>         proposition, to state that the limits of my language are the limits of         my internal world, or my knowledge thereof. The following section, with         which I will conclude this brief sketch, is particularly important in         Wittgenstein's investigation of 'private language' and culminates in the         principle that cinches claims made throughout the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>:         (1) the claim that the function of language derives from its use; and,         relying on Wittgenstein's most celebrated metaphor of the language game,         (2) the claim that it is only because of its place within a set of already         established rules that a word takes on meaning:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;&#9;257.             "How would it be, if people could not express their pain (not groan,             not grimace, etc.)? Then one could not teach a child the use of the             words tooth pain.--Now, let us assume that child to be a genius who             invents itself a name for the feeling!--But now, however, it could             not make itself understandable with this word.--Therefore it understands             the name, but can no one explain its meaning?--But what does it mean             then, that he 'has named his pain'?--How has he done that: to name             pain?! And, whatever he has done, what is its purpose?--When one says             "He has given the feeling a name," one forgets that a lot must be             already prepared in language, in order that the mere naming have sense.             And when from there we say that someone gives pain a name, it is the             grammar of the word "pain" that is already prepared here [<i>so ist             die Grammatik des Wortes &gt;&gt;Schmerz&lt;&lt; hier das Vorbereitete</i>];             it shows the post on which the new word will be placed.</font></p>          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>        </dir>      </dir>      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;It         is "pain" to which I would like to return in Bachmann's <i>Malina</i>.         I have claimed that it is pain over the not yet worked through Austrian         National Socialist past that is the foundation of the "Ich" narrator's         suffering. Clearly pain over a collective past is anything but 'private.'         Though frequently interrupted and incomplete (in addition to broken "telephone         sentences," she is troubled by unfinished letters, an unfinished fairy         tale she attempts to write for Ivan, "The Mysteries of the Princess of         Kagran," and a taped interview with a Herr Muehlbauer that is troubled         by more than technical difficulties), the "Ich" narrator's language does         figure her pain for us, right up until her final line, <i>Es war Mord</i>.         Actually, it is in her madcap interview with Herr Muehlbauer that the         "Ich" explains the poetics of <i>Malina</i> and the <i>Todesarten Zyklus</i>.         Her pain arises not only because she bears "an unavoidable dark history"         within her, but also because as a writer she bears the burden of working         it through in language. "One must suffer away the past" [<i>muB man die         Vergangenheit ganz ableiden</i>], she explains to Herr Muehlbauer:</font></p>      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>      <dir>         <dir>           <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&#9;[O]ne             must suffer away the things other people have no time for in their             countries, in which they are busy and plan and act, they sit in their             countries, truly anachronistic because they are without language,             it is the people who are without language who rule for all time. I             will give away a terrible secret: language is punishment [<i>die Sprache             ist die Strafe</i>]. All things must enter into language and must             be worn away in language according to their guilt and the degree of             their guilt.
