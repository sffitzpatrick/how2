        New York City Women Writers Recall September 11, 2001&#8221; 
      <p class="TITLE2" align="center">edited and introducted by Laura Hinton 
      <p class="TITLE2" align="left">&nbsp;
      <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="left">Introduction: 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>&#8220;All has shifted from the experience 
          to the industry of contemplating it.&#8221; Lines like poetry come into 
          my head half out of some forgotten dream. It is early in the morning, 
          this day, late in June. Last night, I went to a book party celebrating 
          the Etruscan Press anthology, September 11: American Writers Respond. 
          One of the tens of contributors, I listened to editor William Heyen&#8217;s 
          moving speech. I signed the printed page for well-wishers eating cheese 
          and pat&eacute;, posed with writers for a photograph. Leaving before 
          the last hangers-on went for beer, I entered the evening blackness; 
          a cloud rumbled and ruptured above me in the sky. The sky I couldn&#8217;t 
          see, in mid-town Manhattan, quickly drenched my clothes. I stood for 
          half an hour under a leaky construction awning on Fifth Avenue, as if 
          I could save my summer sandals. The storm did not pass. Braving the 
          torrent in a sprint for Grand Central Station, I was wet and miserable 
          in my irony. </em></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I recall again September 11, 2001, the day that 
          began, legendarily, that terrible blue, a day as dry and seamless as 
          a New York City day can be. As I write, we near the approach of the 
          anniversary of September 11th. In the inexplicability of landscapes, 
          it is our industry that makes survivors writers and writers survive. 
          We have indeed shifted from the experience &#8212; because that&#8217;s 
          what survivors, and writers, do. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This section of<em> How2</em> tells a story unfolding 
          in the year since September 11th. Here, New York City women writers 
          speak about &#8220;the horror,&#8221; to borrow from Joseph Conrad, 
          that ripped through our skyline, and settled like an unwanted guest. 
          Writing from a romanticization but also a critique of the colonial &#8220;guest,&#8221; 
          Conrad both fetishized and called into question a &#8220;horror&#8221; 
          within this colonizing &#8220;self.&#8221; The contributors to this 
          section embrace a similar modernist irony. They do so by adopting, and 
          also jettisoning, this version of &#8220;self,&#8221; and the memoire 
          as a form. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The words I wrote down that morning in June expressed 
          my growing sense of guilt and frustration about our &#8220;self&#8221;-expressions 
          since September 11th. These words were not a criticism. They were the 
          beginnings of an acceptance that, in fact, &#8220;poetry is not a luxury,&#8221; 
          as Audre Lorde once wrote, that our writings are as important and serious 
          as the nine-month task of &#8220;rescue workers&#8221; in lower Manhattan. 
          Our blessed state of discourse is laborious and difficult; and it produces 
          not a clarity but a confusion &#8212; one ironically that enunciates 
          its own healing process. When we think about the memoire, in particular 
          &#8212; from a post-modern theoretical perspective &#8212; we think 
          about it as falsely clarifying, with colonial objectives, a form that 
          would render easy the cultural monological &#8220;self.&#8221; Indeed, 
          the memoire traditionally has attempted to memorialise &#8212; to use 
          a fashionable term &#8212; our sentimental faith in language&#8217;s 
          zip-lock lucidity. For experimental writers, the memoire rightly could 
          be seen as the effort to falsely construct one&#8217;s &#8220;self&#8221; 
          as protected container, as if one could separate &#8220;self&#8221; 
          from history and social event. In the case of September 11th, this raises 
          grave issues. As Ann Lauterbach poignantly states in &#8220;What Is 
          a Day?,&#8221; printed here: <em>&#8220;To narrate oneself into a catastrophe 
          with vast and unknowable global consequences seems trivial, or vain 
          . . .&#8221;</em></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The title phrase of this section, &#8220;Memoire/Anti-Memoire,&#8221; 
          reflects these questions about using the memoire form as a response 
          to September 11th. The phrase contains its dualism, as an insistence 
          that we do narrate our memories, our individual experiences, of September 
          11th, even if we do so ironically, and, perhaps, differently. This phrase 
          is borrowed from a recent issue of <em>Chain</em>, whose contributors 
          reconsider the possibilities of the memoire from an experimental-writer&#8217;s 
          positioning. Its collection of writings suggests that the language of 
          memoire need not attempt to reseal memories as if in a leak-proof box. 
          So, too, the women&#8217;s memoirs that follow use and reuse the memoire 
          form to explore tragedy, both personal and social, not through a sentimental 
          re-visioning of events but a re-invention of what and how we articulate 
          them. Our memoirs collectively suggest that writing does not simply 
          &#8220;re-collect&#8221; past events and refurbish them with a bright 
          new literary engine. Rather, writing exists itself as its own event 
          &#8212; as writing. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her study <em>The Body in Pain</em>, Elaine 
          Scarry examined the writings of political torture victims and argued 
          for the necessity of expressing physical pain for political purposes. 
          She also wrote of the impossibility of expressing pain through the medium 
          of language. That necessity, and that inexpressability, I would argue, 
          applies to those trauma victims who observe, so close at hand, human 
          pain and tragedy on a mass scale. As co-victims of mass terror, New 
          Yorkers last September experienced a pain that takes on its own physicality 
          and tragic psychic dimension. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The memoirs that express this experience of pain 
          begin with Suheir Hammad&#8217;s &#8220;First Words Since.&#8221; This 
          powerful memoire-poem, written by the young Palestianian-American poet 
          living in New York, details the suffering of having no words to describe 
          what she has seen by the end of the first week following September 11th, 
          what she has felt and feared. In the duality of a gratitude for life 
          and a fear of political reprisals, Hammad begs that the attackers might 
          not look &#8220;like my brothers.&#8221; It also praises the world of 
          New York City&#8217;s streets: the Korean &#8220;kimchi and bibim bob&#8221; 
          that kept her out late the night before September 11th, away from downtown 
          the next morning; a stranger, a woman, who asked her if she wanted &#8220;a 
          hug&#8221;; the friends and acquaintances who asked, without compunction, 
          if she &#8220;knew the hijackers&#8221; because she is Arab.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Novelist Jamie Callan&#8217;s short theatrical 
          monologue, &#8220;Locating the Pain,&#8221; was also written in the 
          early days following September 11th. It expresses a different set of 
          ironies, the kind that become riveted in the body when painful emotions 
          cannot be expressed and resurface as physical suffering. Removed from 
          the catastrophe in New York City while teaching a screen-writing class 
          at Yale University, Callan tells of a journey to the dentist, in which 
          the pain she could never locate becomes localized in her mouth, in which 
          both a detached dentist and patient try to find &#8220;the pain.&#8221; 
          This act is perceived as a darkly humorous attempt to control the discourse 
          of disaster through the discourse of the medicalized body &#8212; and 
          its own symptoms of emotional repression.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Linsey Abrams&#8217; long poem, &#8220;The New 
          Century,&#8221; suggests that to &#8220;locate the pain&#8221; is impossible, 
          that the pain fans itself out and becomes a linguistic cornucopia of 
          personal perception against the background of historic drama. Abrams&#8217; 
          &#8220;complaint&#8221; &#8212; a form of the memoire that goes back 
          to the literature of Old English &#8212; re-embodies the fragmented 
          sense that we all felt in the early aftermath of September 11th, that 
          feeling of being both depressed and &#8220;on overwhelm.&#8221; As we 
          waited for the next terrorist event, for the next wave of anthrax to 
          be exposed on our subway line, for the next death, Abrams wrote this 
          studied piece in manic artifice. Like Callan&#8217;s memoire, it ultimately 
          reveals what became for New York City residents and workers our collective 
          depression. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">My own memoire, &#8220;The Hole I Cannot See: Smoke 
          and Fragments in New York City,&#8221; is about that collective depression. 
          It attempts to embody, too, our fragmented sense of living in the city 
          last fall. I tried to mirror in the text those gaps I was experiencing 
          between events and my capacity to observe them, between the information 
          I received and did not. I wanted to trouble the conventions of my reportorial 
          memoire by failing to place those conventions in a coherent whole, to 
          plug the hole that I had not yet seen &#8212; left by the World Trade 
          Center and the 3,000 people that perished, and by our own false sense 
          of quotidian agency.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ann Lauterbach&#8217;s &#8220;What is a Day?&#8221; 
          further radicalizes the memoire as form. While she questions why one 
          should &#8220;insert oneself into the cataclysm after<em> the shipwreck 
          of the singular</em>,&#8221; she nevertheless writes that &#8220;One 
          plus three thousand equals three thousand and one.&#8221; She suggests 
          that the &#8220;singular,&#8221; indeed, is a mathematical exponent 
          that raises casualties and stands alone in one&#8217;s difference to 
          mass event. Lauterbach&#8217;s piece suggests through poetry and prose 
          &#8212; the interpolation of vision, nightmare, and fact &#8212; that 
          personal memoire, that the story of one&#8217;s day, need not be told 
          from one perspective but from one&#8217;s own multiplicities of perspectives. 
          &#8220;What is a Day?&#8221; shows the uses of the memoire when it is 
          treated as both broken and lucid, as self-reflexive and externally reportorial 
          &#8212; and that out of horrific tragedy something as daring as Blake&#8217;s 
          tiger emerges steely-eyed and terrifyingly beautiful.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Daniella Gioseffi&#8217;s memoire, &#8220;Sept. 
          11th, Meagan&#8217;s Birthday,&#8221; takes on the political fallout 
          that has ensued following September 11th. It narrates events which began 
          as she watched from her rooftop in Brooklyn the United Airlines jet 
          hit the second World Trade Center tower, and which end with a journey 
          to New England and into progressive American history. Telling of her 
          encounter with a perceptive young girl whose birthday falls, and will 
          always fall, on September 11th, Gioseffi uses the conventions of memoire 
          subversively, as political commentary, expressing political ideas and 
          providing information that challenge their current state repression 
          as replicated by the media. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two final pieces wrestle with our on-going struggle 
          to narrate personal experience after September 11th. Jane Augustine&#8217;s 
          &#8220;History&#8221; tells the story of a friend&#8217;s death in the 
          mountains of Colorado, where Augustine was vacationing this summer, 
          a story permeated with fragments of memories of the deaths of September 
          11th. The fragmented images of self-in-memory create these two separate 
          events that remain separate, but also converge in the experimental poetic 
          sequence. Mei-mei Berssenbrugge&#8217;s poem, &#8220;Safety,&#8221; 
          reflects upon the banality we experience as we witness and identify 
          with others&#8217; suffering from a near distance &#8212; as if witnessing, 
          identifying, would make them safe. Presented against images of the downtown 
          Manhattan architectural spaces and emptiness, the problem of witnessing 
          in &#8220;Safety&#8221; is that of an outsider&#8217;s perspective of 
          the mass tragedy of September 11th. That tragedy is &#8220;memorialized 
          by what I saw,&#8221; through a &#8220;singularity&#8221; that Berssenbrugge, 
          like Lauterbach, questions, but also reflects back, because that is 
          what separates the &#8220;safe&#8221; from the perished, the viewer 
          from the viewed.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The women who have contributed these memoire pieces 
          have dared to face their &#8220;singularity&#8221; in the fact of observing, 
          at close hand, in one&#8217;s community, catastrophic event. We are 
          in the process, the writing process, of moving beyond the shell of singular 
          survival and into the shared history of a city and a society that has 
          lost not only an icon but its fear to bear witness. These selective 
          palimpsests, like my drenching cloud that June night, cover but do not 
          alleviate the harshness of our personal-real. </p>
