          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>What is A Day?” was written in October 2001. I wrote 
            it because I wanted to keep some sense of the various registers of 
            response I had to the 11th of September, including my distress at 
            the violence of the patriotism, hyped media, abuse of privacy, which 
            ensued. </i></P>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>To narrate oneself into a catastrophe with vast and unknowable global 
            consequences seems trivial, or vain, or both. What does it matter 
            where one was or what one did or how one reacted or felt or what one 
            thought, if thinking occurred at all, during or afterwards. </p>
          <p>Why should one insert oneself into the cataclysm after <i>the shipwreck 
            of the singular</i>? </p>
          <p>One plus one equals two.</p>
          <p>One plus one equals eleven.</p>
          <p>One plus three thousand equals three thousand and one.</p>
          <p>The eleventh day of the ninth month is an emergency. </p>
          <p>In an emergency call 911. </p>
          <p>Satan the Joker.</p>
          <p>Flight 11 drove overhead, engines so close it could have been inhaling 
            the air, so one was being sucked up into the roar, had become the 
            roar. </p>
          <p>Out of sleep into nightmare, out of sleep into the visceral recall 
            of earlier times when every plane carried a bomb, when the night sky 
            was nothing if not a seedbed of danger. In New York, in lower Manhattan, 
            during the Second World War, during the Korean War, during the Cold 
            War. Bombs. Planes with bombs. </p>
          <p>Rolled or fell or jumped down onto the floor, covering the head. 
          </p>
          <p>Silence for seconds.</p>
          <p>Then a great thump, a muted swallowing sound, like a snake a rat. 
            Not a big crashing sound, but the sound stealth might make on its 
            way to annihilation. </p>
          <p>One could see nothing, or rather one could not see the Something 
            that had just transpired, because the south-facing windows no longer 
            looked out, but only <i>at</i> the backs of buildings recently constructed 
            into the view. It took months for these buildings to go up, the workers 
            only a stone’s throw away. Scaffolds and hard hats and big male voices 
            and reverberating tools. Bit by bit, the sky is removed, the view 
            of the Towers sealed under the collage of progress, under the sign 
            of a swollen prosperity. In the first days, twenty-odd years before, 
            the world included the Hudson River and the Woolworth Building and 
            the Twin Towers. The days and nights were quiet. The moon came up 
            and stood visible in the framed sky before going on. Sunlight streamed 
            through the big south-facing windows, carrying the glittering facade 
            with it.</p>
          <p>In the first place, and until a few years ago, the downstairs was 
            a hum of activity all night long, long yellow trucks, men loading 
            and unloading foodstuffs — eggs and butter and cheese — to deliver 
            to the restaurants in the city. Now the downstairs is called ROOM; 
            it is filled with smart cool furnishings. Across the street, there 
            are chairs hanging by threads in the window. They cost, according 
            to <i>The New York Times</i>, $140,000 for a set of twelve. Slender 
            women in tight pants and slim pointed shoes stand on the loading dock 
            with their cellphones, speaking with French accents. They do not smile 
            when one passes them carrying one’s groceries.</p>
          <p class=MsoBodyText>The neighborhood seems overtaken by a throng of 
            well-dressed young persons who move as if blind, barely noting the 
            parts of the world that do not directly address their needs or intentions 
            or designs; they walk as if the world were put there for them, is 
            a result of their desires. They seem to have no sense of time, as 
            if nothing existed before they arrived, and nothing will exist when 
            they leave.    </p>
          <p>One siren.</p>
          <p>Another siren.</p>
          <p>Make coffee, get dressed. One is alive after all, after <i>whatever 
            that was.</i> Turn on the television. One never turns on the television 
            in the morning, in the day, but <i>something</i> just happened. A 
            bright female voice is talking to a male voice who is describing sitting 
            on his balcony in Union Square, sipping his morning coffee, and seeing 
            a jet come in low, too low, calling to his wife<i>, hey honey, come 
            look at this jet</i> <i>so low over the city.</i> One sees the image 
            of a shadow plane, the plane’s silhouette like a cut-out, a template, 
            peculiarly dematerialized.</p>
          <p>The body and mind in discreet places, wires crossed, thinking one 
            should get to the basement, take cover, thinking about tornadoes, 
            hurricanes, huge winds, and bombs. Confused between accident and intent, 
            acts of nature and acts of man. </p>
          <p>One does not remember at what moment Terror took on motivation, pulled 
            the cause into the effect, the effect into the cause. </p>
          <p>Pictures of a tower in flames.</p>
          <p>Still, one does not quite register that the plane was that plane, 
            the towers those towers. One is at the place that the tiny TV screen 
            is making into an image. See! Look there! Where? <i>At</i> <i>passages.</i> 
            The actual collides with its images. </p>
          <p>The cat goes into the closet.</p>
          <p>One goes upstairs to the neighbors. We are not good neighbors to 
            each other, we are poor denizens, neither friendly nor unfriendly, 
            who have lived with a floor between us for more than twenty years. 
            The neighbor is wild with worry for her son. Her teenage daughter 
            tries to look as if nothing is happening. Her television is blasting; 
            one hears the word “Pentagon”.</p>
          <p>One goes downstairs. M. is standing near the elevator. She lives 
            on the top floor with her three sons and her husband, S. the landlord, 
            son of Harry, who started his butter and eggs business here decades 
            ago. She is wearing a pretty dress. One mentions the basement; M stares; 
            she mentions the school. We are not in each other’s company. The trajectories 
            of fear do not intersect; words spoken fly into the dead space of 
            incomprehension.</p>
          <p>One goes out. One looks to the right, where a small crowd has gathered 
            on the northeast corner of Hudson Street, everyone looking up, looking 
            south. One walks to the corner and looks south. The tower is in flames, 
            orange flames licking out of the edges as if one had thrown a box 
            into a fireplace. </p>
          <p>There are no comparisons. It is not <i>like </i>anything.</p>
          <p>One is back in the house. There is an explosion, the windows rattle, 
            the building shimmies. A sudden wash of pale grayish particles rains 
            down. The TV picture turns into a spray of splinters and the sound 
            shreds into a shimmer of agitating vibrations.</p>
          <p>One goes back onto the street. More people, moving and gathering. 
            One walks to the other corner, the West side. One looks up, the other 
            tower is in flames. It looks like the first tower. Symmetry. </p>
          <p><i>Tyger, Tyger, Burning Bright</i></p>
          <p><i>In the Forest of the Night</i></p>
          <p><i>What</i></p>
          <p>Persons scream, point. </p>
          <p>Above, tiny figures are emerging out of the windows, out into the 
            blue air.  </p>
          <p>Slowly turning out, floating into the air, seemingly weightless, 
            like paper dolls.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Persons below are weeping, sobbing, running.</p>
          <p>Now the whole city is a Siren, an Engine heading downtown.</p>
          <p><i>Immortal Hand or Eye</i></p>
          <p><i>Could frame thy Fearful Symmetry?</i></p>
          <p>Even as a little girl, one refused to watch the newsreels of war.</p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>My nephew Richard phones; I tell him I am frightened. He says his 
            friend David is at home across the street. Richard has recently married; 
            he works for ABC News. David has recently married; he makes films. 
            They are both in their early thirties. I leave with a bottle of water 
            and my purse; I do not shut the windows. I go across the street, ring 
            David’s doorbell. David gives me some scotch, says he is going to 
            pack a bag and walk north, find his wife who is in the Village. </p>
          <p><i>It takes a village.</i></p>
          <p>David says we can go across the street and close your windows and 
            you can pack a bag. I say I am too frightened to go back, let’s just 
            leave. We leave, walk north, through pockets and eddies of persons 
            looking bewildered and scared, some of whom start to run in panic. 
            The sirens are now at a steady pitch, billowing downstream into the 
            maw of it. I do not look back.</p>
          <p><i>Don’t look back.</i></p>
          <p>David keeps saying, “I just want to see my wife.” He says, “Now we 
            are refugees.”</p>
          <p>At Bank Street, where David’s wife is with some of their friends, 
            I do not want to watch the big TV screen in the small apartment. I 
            do not want to see any more of it, but I do see the towers collapse 
            like so many gossamer threads. I do see the shadow shape of the airliner 
            plunge into the tower. I see the huge orange ball of fire coming out 
            of the side of one of them, immense flaming innards from a ruptured 
            body. </p>
          <p>Everyone in the world is seeing these images. </p>
          <p>A wholly Phallic rape, the plane penetrating the material verticality 
            of the erect.</p>
          <p>How big is yours? </p>
          <p>I have two. </p>
          <p>Mine, mine. </p>
          <p>One minus one is zero.</p>
          <p>I never liked the Twin Towers. I was working on Broome Street in 
            SoHo in the early 1970s, as a waitress, shortly after they were completed, 
            and I saw them each day as I walked to work. I found them totemic 
            and graceless, not so much minimal as monolithic. If this is world 
            trade, then why is everything the same? Where is the reciprocity and 
            recognition of difference? What or where is the Other between two 
            identical objects?</p>
          <p>If this is world trade, then why is it so anonymous, so indifferent, 
            uninflected by the human, so insistently abstract? What are these 
            colossal vertical plinths, dwarfing all else, meant to mean to a city 
            of pedestrians, of island wanderers, of immigrants? Where is the space 
            of dream, the vicissitude of hope and disappointment, the contemplation 
            of the space between action and consequence? </p>
          <p>If this is the <i>world trade center</i>, then where is the world, 
            where is the trade, where is the center?  Where is the turn of the 
            tide, where the humility of looking back from far off in space, tiny 
            blue and white ball in a great sea of change? Where is the horizon, 
            the distant line that gives definition to days and nights, figures 
            the man and the woman, the beasts of burden, the road from town to 
            town, from wilderness to city, the space of voyage, discovery, routes 
            from China, from Spain, from England, over, and from, sea to shining 
            sea? </p>
          <p><i>Giant step for mankind.</i></p>
          <p>Not trade but power, not exchange, but raw Capital on its hegemonic 
            march. </p>
          <p>Upward mobility. </p>
          <p>Out of <i>scale</i> with everything around it.<i>  </i> </p>
          <p>Scale n. <i>a drinking vessel; a bowl; a cup. </i></p>
          <p>The obsolete definition gives way to the two dishes of a balance 
            or a machine for weighing.</p>
          <p><i>Things weigh in the balance.</i></p>
          <p>The figure of Justice with her <i>scales.</i></p>
          <p>When, twenty years ago, my friend Jennifer had her wedding supper 
            at the Windows on the World Restaurant, I could feel the tower shift 
            in the wind like a dry reed. </p>
          <p>Eventually, I learned to love the weather play against them, the 
            sapphire blue of long Manhattan twilights, the dark pewter gauze of 
            cloud or fog or mist covering their tops like an ethereal hem, the 
            setting sun splashing its scarlet radiance against their reflective 
            surfaces.</p>
          <p>Glass and water.</p>
          <p>I thought they were like fish leaping from the water. I wrote, “The 
            Twin Towers rise like wet fish and as briefly tragic.” I saw them 
            then, imagined them, falling back down, into the water. </p>
          <p>Late in the day I go uptown by subway with another nephew, Jack, 
            who is an architect. He has walked down from his office to Bank Street 
            to get me. We sit outside together, just down the street from Saint 
            Vincent’s Hospital, which is strangely quiet. I can see a crowd of 
            white uniformed doctors and nurses milling about, waiting. David and 
            his friends try to give blood, but the lines are too long. Elizabeth 
            takes some bags of clothes over. Elizabeth cannot believe her view 
            has been so changed.</p>
          <p>When the fighter jets begin to streak overhead, I cannot bear the 
            sound, cover my ears.  </p>
          <p><i>Friendly fire.</i></p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday morning, my friends Peter and Susie and I set out from 
            their house on 85<sup>th</sup> Street. The city is quiet, no traffic, 
            the stores are closed. We find a gypsy cab, whose driver tells us 
            he can only go as far as 14<sup>th</sup> Street. We zip down Ninth 
            Avenue. In the unencumbered distance, we can see the cloud of orange 
            tinged smoke rising, filling the bright blue southern sky. </p>
          <p>We walk south, stop at a Gristedes for some water. A man at the check-out 
            counter is counting out dollar bills, hundreds of them, to give to 
            the clerk so she has change for the customers. We buy bottles water 
            and continue to walk. </p>
          <p>We are stopped by a police barricade. I say I live on Duane Street 
            and need to get my cat. The policeman is gentle, and tells us to go 
            to the next corner, where I show my ID, and we continue south. We 
            pass a wrecked car covered in white dust. We stop at Citibank to get 
            some cash. I keep saying, “There is no way the garage is going to 
            be open. I will not be able to get my car.” All I want to do is to 
            leave the city.</p>
          <p><i>Fight or flight.   </i></p>
          <p>The air is thick with gritty particles. We run into the poet Jackson 
            MacLow and his composer wife Anne Tardos, who are trying to buy some 
            food, but who do not want to go further south because the air is too 
            bad. Jackson looks small and recessed and ashen.</p>
          <p>The building where I live is dark and vacant; a sign on the downstairs 
            door says that my landlord suggests the tenants evacuate because there 
            is no electricity or gas.</p>
          <p>Madonna, my aged cat, named for the pop star, comes out from her 
            hiding place in the closet. She looks betrayed and resentful. </p>
          <p>To the south, where there had been the aspiring pillars, a massive 
            pile steams and heaves like a beached whale, its great belly engorged 
            with sorrow and waste.</p>
          <p>The man who is always at the Kinney garage is sitting on a chair 
            where he always sits, at the entrance ramp. He has ebony skin and 
            a kind, chiseled face. I say the obvious in disbelief: “You are open!” 
            He says, smiling, without irony, “We are open twenty-four hours a 
            day.” </p>
          <p>From, for example, the 11<sup>th</sup> of September until the 12<sup>th</sup> 
            of September, 2001. I am thinking, <i>What is a day?</i>  He says 
            he cannot take credit cards or a check, only cash. I borrow money 
            from Peter.</p>
          <p>4.</p>
          
      <p>Now it is October. The days move away from the Day, but the Day stays 
        near, does not move back in time. It feels as if it wants to attach itself 
        to another day, equally terrible. There are flags everywhere, messages 
        of condolence from anonymous companies in the paper, scraps of paper on 
        buildings with pictures of missing persons. People in the neighborhood 
        seem to be moving more slowly, with less sureness of where they are going. 
        On the weekend, a steady parade of persons streams past, cameras around 
        their necks, to stare at the wreckage. There is a smell of burning, acrid 
        and gritty, rubbing against the bright autumnal air. The sky where the 
        towers were is empty, as if time had rolled backwards. The Woolworth building 
        looks taller, less archaic, like an elderly relative suddenly called to 
        stand in for the dead.</p>
