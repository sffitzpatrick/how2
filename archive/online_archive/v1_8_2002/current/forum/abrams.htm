      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>September 11 started for my lover and me as a 
        videotape of the first plane on our bedroom TV. We were among the lucky 
        New Yorkers.  Half-crazed, I ran outside to the sickening evidence of 
        a smoky shaft in the sky downtown.  In the two minutes I stood there, 
        they hit the other tower, which I found out back inside.  I was not one 
        of those writers who contemplated whether you can write about a tragedy 
        as it is happening.  I was devastated and furious, and I still am. Sitting 
        in front of the TV, I started taking down facts that seemed important, 
        and I kept this up for three months. I edited what I had, and it became 
        a poem.  </em></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">&nbsp;</p>
      <P >Living in New York, you think you’ve seen everything.   </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that 14th Street, your street, had seemed 
        a likely frontier.   You knew <i>global warming </i>was<br>
        going to flood Manhattan, making all downtown a shipwreck.<i>  Some day</i>.  
        But this?</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>And not that if you’d been that guy in the 
        subway in Washington, D.C., and everyone’s cell<br>
        phone started ringing, you’d have known what was going on either. </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that a manual on flying a commercial jet 
        is the same as flying it. Not that Venice, Florida,<br>
        with its shitty rental cars, should be confused with Venice, Italy.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that the Mayor’s emergency bunker under 
        #7 WTC  was such a good place to hide.  Not that<br>
        you cared to make further criticism of that government idea or any other 
        at the moment.  Though<br>
        why someone would form a motorcade to a secret location, unless it’s a 
        decoy, is a mystery.  Not<br>
        that <i>decoy</i> had been a staple of your vocabulary...except as referring 
        to duck hunting, which<br>
        you’re against. </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that your young mother, working at the 
        Pentagon, had expected the highest clearance.  Or to<br>
        know about Pearl Harbor hours before she could tell.  Not that everyone 
        wants to hear<br>
        immediately about tragedies.</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that a drill is the real thing.  Not that 
        the real thing is readily recognizable. </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that it wasn’t bad timing that your lover’s 
        father had been moved from Florida--by the two<br>
        of you--to the Bronx the day before.</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>And not that it wasn’t puzzling to have paid 
        September rent plus deposit, $3900 each, to install<br>
        him in <i>assisted living</i>, only to be asked to move him out.  Not 
        that people with Parkinson’s can<br>
        always help drooling.</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that you’d have planned your last communal 
        experience before it happened, to be at Ikea<br>
        buying him furniture.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that you were offended at first by <i>Attack 
        on America</i>.  The same tag line for every program<br>
        you could get on TV.  Meaning cable and only CBS of the broadcast channels, 
        since they hadn’t<br>
        ever taken down the old antenna.  On the Empire State Building, from when<i> 
        it </i>was the highest<br>
        point in New York.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that you’d ever paid attention to the 
        Woolworth Building, featured in the first hour of<br>
        coverage, and certainly not to its height, dwarfed at the tip of Manhattan.  
        Frankly, you were<br>
        concerned about the ground level Woolworths, disappearing like black holes 
        that sucked down <br>
        into them all the little tools and objects of the universe.  Not that 
        you remember half of what<br>
        those were now.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that you hadn’t complained about your 
        lover’s  45-minute showers.  Not that you’d have<br>
        been with her that morning otherwise.  Where would you have been?  On 
        the map of uncanny<br>
        places...not where assassinations take place, for example,  but where 
        people were when they<br>
        heard.  Empire of a single tourist.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Make a dot for Disney World, with the imposter 
        Goofy and the imposter Donald Duck, in<br>
        Orlando, Florida.  (Pencil in the whole damn state: #1 in carjackings, 
        #52 in health care.) You<br>
        hadn’t intended to feel sad when they closed it. </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not  that you thought canceling an election--even 
        a local primary--was a good thing.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Though not that the last election--for President-- 
        topped your list of outrages now.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Who ever thought they’d wonder where Air Force 
        One was? </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Or in their lifetime visit www. fbi.org?  
        Defend the stock market’s right to exist? </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>The Japanese proverb that didn’t apply: <i>Fall 
        down seven times, stand up eight.</i><u></u></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>What wasn’t the marathon: a horde of people 
        crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.  </p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Not that  everyone was Caucasian and not that 
        everyone was old, who escaped hair to shoes<br>
        frosted white. </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>Imponderables: the one who had cramps and 
        drank the vodka,  the one on vacation, the one who<br>
        told the boss<u> </u>go fuck yourself and quit.  The one who had to have 
        the bagel.  The one who was<br>
        always late.  The one who voted come hell or high water...twice.  The 
        one whose dog wouldn’t<br>
        pee.  The mother who time-shared.  The screenwriter so broke she took 
        the bus to LA and not the<br>
        plane.  The one who in the eighties became a coke-head and never worked 
        again.  The one who<br>
        had a terminal illness anyway.  The chef of Windows on the World, floor 
        110, who veered off<br>
        for eyeglasses.  All that food pureed.</p>
      <p style='text-align:justify'>And the destiny of paper: reams prematurely 
        to the shredder, all documents in the<i> Disaster</i> file. <br>
        Passports and drivers licenses unnecessary for impromptu free fall.<i>

      <p>Not that they <i>let stand</i> the remark that it happened in New York

        as controlling world<br>

      <p>Not that they <i>let stand</i> the e-mail sent to seventeen thousand

        and Blessings, </i>name<br>
        withheld in poem to avoid lawsuit.  </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>In a flash poll, 61% of Americans favored waging war.  62% weren’t sure 
        on whom.  Your lover<br>
        said, <i>Between evil people and idiots, we’ve had it.</i></p>
      <p>Children are the only logicians: <br>
        The girl who said, <i>So if they didn’t like New York, why couldn’t they 
        just ignore New York</i>?<br>
        The boy who when told there were people missing asked, <i>Are their mothers 
        looking for them</i>?</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>Driving back to the City, three days later, from an emergency trip to 
        your own mother in Boston,<br>
        you were mildly surprised to pass a check point.  Not that you expected 
        warships in New York<br>
        Harbor, where your ostentatious friend had rented a boat for the Bicentennial.  
        Everyone got<br>
        seasick from the wake of so many pleasure crafts and threw up their fancy 
        dinners.  It was 1976,<br>
        the last time you saw so many flags.</p>
      <p>The Javitz Center reminded you of Woodstock.  Minus the music, admittedly.  
        All right.  Plus<br>
        the National Guard.  But there were the reserves of food stacked to the 
        spirit of communal<br>
        destiny and the unilateral high hopes of youth.  Still, those helicopters 
        weren’t about to download<br>
        ten cases of artichoke hearts from the now defunct Concorde Hotel in the 
        Catskills.  An acid<br>
        head’s feast.  You saw two girls in hijabs and tight pants riding a sawhorse 
        from a barricade,<br>
        being cruised by two Hasidic boys trying to outrace their coats.  A pair 
        of debutantes accepting<br>
        free Cokes from their ghetto counterparts, who magnanimously threw in 
        a straw each. <br>
        Everything comes in twos, apparently.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>The Twins as celebrities.  The most recent subjects of the serial neighborhood 
        murals: RIP Lady<br>
        Di, Mother Theresa, JFK Jr., Selena the pop star shot dead, and Lisa shaken 
        by her crack head<br>
        step-father.  Or was it Marta?  Well, anyway, one of those girls.  Like 
        Greek tragedy, no joke.  </p>
      <p>Union Square was the opposite of a rogues’ gallery:  Thank God for scotch 
        tape and color Xerox<br>
        and digital photography, for part-time actors’ head shots and yearbooks.  
        The ugly rejected<br>
        passport photos, the wedding albums of the divorced.  Authors’ book  jackets, 
        expired IDs, last<br>
        year’s Christmas cards, the calendar from Fotomat, the Polaroids.  Thank 
        God for all flat<br>
        surfaces.  Before it was understood that, like the flight crews, no one 
        would be found: Hung from<br>
        a wall, a king size bed sheet with the names  in Magic Marker of the permanently 
        sleeping,<br>
        captioned: <i><u>American</u> Proud and Tall.  <u>United</u> Through it 
        All.</i>  And underfoot,  <i>Ode to a Flight<br>
        Attendant</i> on cardboards taped haphazardly to the sidewalk.  A kite 
        tail too heavy for the kite.<br>
        Grief is like a dream in which all wishes of the dead are granted.  A 
        mother now writes of her<br>
        daughter, <i>Distinguishing Features: tongue ring, fish tattoo.</i><u></u></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********<u></u></p>
      <p>Your <i>own </i>mother can’t remember if she’s taken her pills or where 
        she lost either plate of her<br>
        dentures.  Both pairs.  But she remembered where her hair dresser was.  
        She cleaned out her<br>
        bank account, not to pay him or contribute to the $2000 replacement teeth 
        but to hand over a<br>
        month’s Social Security for a cruise that she was offered over the phone 
        for free. Not that that<br>
        could be attributed solely to dementia. How could it be free? my brother 
        yelled at her, if you<br>
        gave them $1200? <u></u></p>
      <p>Korsakoff’s Syndrome sounded like something romantic but it was just 
        short term memory loss<br>
        from alcoholism.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>Not that you could call all the makeshift morgues ghost towns exactly...since 
        no one had ever <br>
        lived there.</p>
      <p>And not that those towers were our redwoods if you’re being literal.</p>
      <p>Not that a human chain is the best metaphor for a policeman leading a 
        whole floor of people by<br>
        hand down 95 flights of a pitch black stairwell, albeit with a better 
        than average flashlight. <br>
        Maybe picture DNA, so unfathomable as to be beautiful.  Or something ordinary 
        but almost<br>
        crazy, like a conga line. </p>
      <p>Not that one woman who wore a placemat over her face to breathe, actually 
        thought it was<br>
        Afghanistan.  Though try running when you’re wearing a whole tablecloth.</p>
      <p>And not that the Taliban--who blew up the two largest Buddhas in the 
        world--merited special<br>
        consideration anyway.  Unless everyone deserves a second chance?  Fair 
        enough. Pick a number<br>
        between one and 110.  </p>
      <p>So if we’ve had the disappeared and the homeless, is it now <i>the pulverized</i>? 
        The minced-meat?<br>
        Previous to this you associated body parts with serial killers, one problem 
        New York doesn’t<br>
        have.  Not that you could have imagined in your wildest dreams your lover 
        saying, <i>It’s the<br>
        bodies</i>, after you commented that the workers were cooking again in 
        the basement below your<br>
        window.  The wind had shifted. OK, so you’re not a pacifist any more.</p>
      <p>42, 000 windows.  16 acres.  5,843 dead or missing a week later. The 
        devil is in the details.</p>

      <p>Bubba Starxxxx<br>
        spelled with four x’s<br>
        Funkmaster Flex and Boris<br>
        You wanted to be superheroes<br>
        But ended up Rap DJ’s<br>
        on a billboard.<br>
        Imagine a better resume:<br>

        Desired job: rescue worker<br>
        When available: immediately</p>
      <p>How do you see yourself in five years?<br>
        Capable of heroic measures.</p>
      <p>Interview: <i>Myself and EMT Ramos have been part of a trained force.  
        We’ve been treated with<br>
        oxygen.  We follow orders.</i>  Did you see any deaths?  <i>I witnessed 
        a disaster beyond my wildest <br>
        dreams, ma’am.</i></p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>Your friend, older than your mother, who climbed down 43 flights of stairs<br>
        and was finally being elevated back up was asked by a TV reporter,<br>
        if she’d known at the time that everything in her apartment was going 
        to be destroyed<br>
        what was the one thing she’d have wanted to save? <br>
        <i>The view</i>, your friend said.</p>
      <p>Further evidence of ruin: the name <i>Mohammed Islam</i> on a hack license.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>Can the personal be tragic? <br>
        Is one the loneliest number?</p>
      <p>Not that fitting your mother with a diaper that weekend  was as bad as 
        the devastation at home. <br>
        But not that a part of you--and her--didn’t wish she’d been blown to smithereens 
        too. Not that<br>
        she would remember thinking that. </p>
      <p>In the Bronx your father-in-law (in a better world) was the same irritating 
        man.  Falling out of<br>
        his wheel chair trying to pick up a paper clip...hording electrical cords 
        without plugs...using<br>
        batteries with just enough charge to ruin music.  He sprays the cans of 
        whipped cream directly<br>
        into his mouth.  </p>
      <p>Not that the movers, meanwhile, driving via New Jersey, had planned to 
        run their truck into the<br>
        George Washington Bridge.  Clearly, ripping a hole in your own roof is 
        not a terrorist act.</p>
      <p>So three of the terrorists turned out to be from Delray Beach, Florida, 
        where you spent<br>
        September 8-10 packing up one old man’s paltry and final treasures.  The 
        same place where later<br>
        they found the first Anthrax.    If you think life isn’t a mystery, ponder 
        that.  </p>
      <p>Or the randomness of sweethearts:<br>
        someone clasping the nearest hand to jump with that person off a roof<br>
        a man on a cell phone connecting to 911 and his soulmate operator from 
        an airplane.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>One rumor was the shower of gold rising from bullion reserves buried 
        under the buildings. <br>
        Survivors saw this as a miracle.  For them it was.</p>
      <p>And the rest hardly more credible.  The special dogs scrambling over 
        the smoking rubble, who<br>
        when being bathed and rehydrated strained to return?  How they could identify 
        the traumatized<br>
        workers--though maybe that was everyone--wasn’t explained.  But their 
        paws became so sore<br>
        and inflamed that Patagonia donated little pads.  Where<i> is </i>that 
        again? I asked my lover, who was<br>
        reading aloud the paper.  <i>The company</i>, she clarified.  They donated 
        <i>gortex pads</i>.  Forgive me for<br>
        thinking Shangri-la. </p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>The new grammar:<br>
        A flight attendant is not a stewardess<br>
        A fire is not a paring knife to remove a person’s skin just so.<br>
        An airplane is not a yo-yo.  It can go down but that’s the end of <i>up.</i><br>
        A subway is not a chute to hell. It’s hell.<br>
        A gap in the skyline is not an amputation.<br>
        An amputation is nevertheless not by custom performed with an airplane. 
        <br>
        <i>Disaster Zone</i> is not a good sign for your nephew’s bedroom door 
        now.<br>
        People can’t say, and mean, that they were lucky to have survived high 
        school.<br>
        Honestly, analysis never prepared you for this.</p>
      <p>Other things you never expected <br>
        but secretly may have hoped for:<br>
        The Queen of England to sing the <i>Star-spangled Banner</i><u>.</u><br>
        Elizabeth Taylor to slip into the Armory on Park Avenue to visit the families.<br>
        The Gurkhas to be sent on assignment in Afghanistan. How often have you 
        heard,<i>Whatever<br>
        happened to the Gurkhas?  </i>Not often enough. </p>
      <p>The high school marching band from Huntsville, Alabama, that played, 
        standing stock still, at the<br>
        site.  The psychic in Brighton Beach who came out of retirement to help 
        find the living then<br>
        stayed to contact the dead.  The mother and son who drove straight through 
        with crawfish from<br>
        Louisiana.  The Oregon tourists who refused to cancel.</p>
      <p align=center style='text-align:center'>**********</p>
      <p>So what if Kate Smith commissioned <i>God Bless America</i> to have a 
        hit.<br>
        So what--you half mean this-- if the Yankees lose the World Series.  <br>
        And so what if your cell phone won’t work from the subway never mind a 
        747.<br>
        It’s become a cliche:<i> location, location, location</i>.  And yet<br>
        Suddenly nothing else matters.</p>
      <p>How could all that happened<br>
        Have fit into one week for one reason in one city? <br>
        Because this is New York.  <br>
        Where else would the 21st century have begun?</p>
