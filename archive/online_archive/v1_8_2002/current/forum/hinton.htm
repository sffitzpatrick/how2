      <P align="center" CLASS="TITLE2">Laura Hinton</P> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p><P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>My piece was written during October 2001, during 
        a time of illness.  It was part of my indirect attempt to acquire a language 
        to express physical illness, to gain an interior vision of the dislocations 
        of body and mind.  This dislocation seemed to me tragically mirrored in 
        the urban atmosphere that was the aftermath of the attacks upon the City 
        of New York, where I reside, and continue to work and teach. </em></P>

        </i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marguerite 
        Duras</p>
      <P>&nbsp;</p>
      <P>&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like the majority of New Yorkers on the morning of 
        September 11, what I saw, or did not see, was what I viewed on my TV screen. 
        Many report that seeing those commercial jetliners crash into the World 
        Trade Center towers, then watching them fall like paper fans, created 
        an odd sense of <i>déjà vu</i>, of having seen that movie before.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            It was not like a movie to me. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            I saw nothing.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I rehearse again and again what I saw or did not 
        see September 11. I make words serve as placeholders for the hole in what 
        I perceived. I must have fed my crying cats that morning of the 11th. 
        I must have tried to feed myself, determined to go about some physical 
        order of the day.  I decided I should eat breakfast. Blueberries in cereal 
        would be nice. I ventured down my walk-up apartment building to cross 
        Third Avenue for the Korean deli. Hit by a sudden wave of light, I was 
        hit by another wave, that of people marching up the street. People in 
        suits with haircuts, women in high heels toting briefcases. People who 
        did not belong to my no-name Manhattan neighborhood. Buy berries, I told 
        myself, trying not to stare. Lingering in the light, I became one with 
        the strangers streaming up the avenue, flowing like a river running backwards, 
        like salmon swimming upstream.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">They were the downtown survivors. Polished, dressed, 
        they brought with them the ashen black smoke that filled the widening 
        sky of lower Manhattan and the hole I could not see. They came out of 
        the belly of the smoke automaton-like, mobilized in their unified stride. 
        Silent, grim, they contrasted against the backdrop of my neighborhood 
        denizens, who perched on corners and stoops, unshaven men, old women with 
        bags, Indian restaurant owners wet from having cleaned their sidewalks.   
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I entered the deli. It was bustling with business. 
        Employees struggled to fill orders for take-out sandwiches — although 
        it was not lunchtime — and coffee.  But a heavy silence penetrated the 
        air. People waited in lines all too patiently for New Yorkers. A woman 
        broke the silence, saying to no one in particular, “My mother, I called 
        my mother.” She was walking to her mother’s house on 98<sup>th</sup> Street. 
        She was wearing high heels. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Where are you walking from?” I asked. Stupid question. 
        I must have been thinking about blueberries. “I work at the World Trade 
        Center,” she said. I glanced at her elegant, pinched pumps and I wished 
        I could have given her my tattered loafers. But I said nothing.  It was 
        my first venture into the hole, the place where I couldn’t speak. And 
        I no longer could see her anyway, because my eyes had this watery glaze 
        coating them, smearing my glasses lens.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Blinded, gagged, I felt useless to help anyone at 
        all. Uselessness would define the rim of my hole, which now was a vortex. 
        In the hole was a powerful dark channel that had swallowed up my power 
        to activate, to create, to escape. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> My will had been metaphorically fragmented into 
        smoke. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The next 24 hours I spent more or less alone. Classes 
        at my university were cancelled. The bridges and tunnels into Manhattan 
        were closed. My son was stuck in Brooklyn, my husband stranded in Westchester. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I did receive an afternoon visit, however, from a 
        long-lost friend.  She called from Penn Station. She had chosen this day 
        to come in to Manhattan from New Jersey to buy her young daughter a snowsuit. 
        The World Trade Center collapsed and she went to Macy’s to buy the snowsuit. 
        She didn’t know what else to do.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Grateful to be helpful to someone, I said to come 
        on over. A few minutes later, sitting on my sofa, she said, “What does 
        one do on doomsday?” Indeed, what does one do?</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We went to lunch.  </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So while the World Trade Center blazed, we sat in 
        a local restaurant and had a sandwich. Its bar was filled with the strangers 
        in suits, their briefcases strewn haphazardly around tables. People were 
        drinking. Television screens blared everywhere. Every two minutes the 
        World Trade Center towers collapsed and incinerated over and over. Television 
        reporters tried to say something new every time. They repeated themselves, 
        just like the image. Their voices would be over-ridden by the buzz of 
        helicopters circling the air. The strangers sat in small groups drinking 
        and smoking. It was hard to get a sandwich. None of the restaurant’s workers 
        from Queens and Brooklyn could come in to work, so the restaurant owner 
        and a couple of friends were trying to manage everything. They were doing 
        a lousy job. They were quickly running out of food. They charged my credit 
        card someone else’s amount. The sandwich tasted like salt and sand. I 
        couldn’t eat. Every few minutes I hopped from my table and saw some piece 
        of the World Trade Center burn again and turn to dust. I saw the reruns. 
        But I couldn’t stand still long enough to really see.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Alone again in the early evening, I wandered the 
        streets toward lower Manhattan. I went as far as police barricades would 
        permit, to 14<sup>th</sup> Street, where the cops stood like tin soldiers 
        all on alert. A few people were escorted in and out of the metal barricades, 
        wearing facemasks. Others there at the barricades were snapping photographs. 
        I couldn’t see what they were trying to see through their camera lenses. 
        There was no marked gape in the skyline, for everything was darkness, 
        everything covered in a huge black pall. Then I thought I saw the outline 
        of the World Trade Center towers hovering in the air. It quickly vanished, 
        a mirage of smoke. Of course, I saw nothing. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I worked my way back through Madison Park, where 
        the street people were rolled up in their tattered blankets. There were 
        other people, as well, a crying woman here and there, sitting alone in 
        the descending dark on a park bench, wearing tennis shoes and nylon hose, 
        perhaps a leather bag propped against her. These were the new “homeless.” 
        Perhaps they couldn’t get over the bridge to husbands in New Jersey, perhaps 
        they had lost someone downtown and were searching for him, for her. Really, 
        who were they? Their heads in their hands, they looked unattached to the 
        landscape. Women in nylon hose don’t sit in parks alone, at night, in 
        New York City.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I turned again to see what I wanted to see — the 
        outline of the World Trade Center. The black pall now blended without 
        distinction into the black of the night sky. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I wandered from Madison Park to Gramercy Park, through 
        one of its wrought-iron gates usually closed to outsiders. Tonight, exclusive, 
        lush Gramercy was an open oasis. Inside, students were holding a candlelight 
        vigil. They were singing “Amazing Grace.” I joined them on a chorus of 
        what I would later e-mail my friends was “Amazing Grave.” I had absorbed 
        Mayor Guiliani’s unintended pun from morning television news broadcasts, 
        describing unknown but “grave” casualties. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I had seen the smoke. I knew those people had vaporized.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the days that would pass, I did not watch TV. 
        I could not watch the towering crematoriums burn and smoke, spin and turn 
        to ash.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But I did read the newspapers in search of information. 
        I wanted questions articulated for which politicians had already made 
        easy answers. Experts on Islam came out the back alleys of university 
        corridors and wrote eloquent columns on the page. Yet I was combing for 
        another sort of information. I was looking for mention of exactly who 
        those people were at the World Trade Center on September 11. I was looking 
        for some understanding of how to interpret so sudden an arrested fate.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I reconstructed stories and put them into my hole. 
        This act was futile. The hole had swept through them. It was growing wider. 
        Stories require a beginning, a middle and an end. We had the beginnings, 
        we had portions of middles. But we had no ends. No closure. Many have 
        no identities. Those engulfed by the World Trade Center are still called 
        the “Missing.” As of now, most have not been legally declared dead.  Relatives 
        wait, hoping for better news.  There are shadows but few bodies. No closure 
        is in sight. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without bodies, we cling to fragments. I cling to 
        the fragments of stories I read, for example, in the <i>New York Times</i>. 
        There, a daily page, euphemistically entitled, “Portraits of Grief,” provides 
        short eulogies about the World Trade Center’s “Missing.” This page might 
        better be called, “Fragments about the Dead.” It is part of a new <i>Times</i> 
        section published for the occasion of terrorism and war, which, too, bears 
        a euphemism: “A Nation Challenged.” This title might also be more aptly 
        rephrased. I would call it, “A Nation Filled with Anguish and Horror,” 
        or, “The Nation of Paranoia” section. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I open up today’s <i>Times</i>. One “portrait” is 
        about a young Yugoslavian immigrant who had fallen in love with New York 
        City.  He recently had matriculated at Baruch College, one of the colleges 
        constituting the City University of New York. I teach at another CUNY 
        campus. This young Yugoslavian could have been one of my students. He 
        could have been my neighbor. I teach uptown, but I live near Baruch. I 
        could have seen him at the xerox store on Third Avenue, where the students 
        duplicate textbooks at registration. I could have bumped into him at the 
        checkout stand at Duane Reade Drugstore. I could have passed him <i>en 
        route</i> to the subway as he kissed his girlfriend on the corner of Lexington 
        and 26<sup>th</sup>. According to the girlfriend, “He loved everything” 
        about New York. Apparently, he loved her, too. She is inconsolable.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Then there is the junior high-school sweetheart who 
        did not propose to his wife until they both had turned 26.  When they 
        finally married, the formerly wild party-boy and drifter settled down 
        to a nice steady life as a bonds trader, at Cantor Fitzgerald, in the 
        World Trade Center.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is the young father that my stepson knew, another 
        Cantor Fitzgerald employee. He would show photos around of his baby girl 
        when coming in on his New Jersey train. His wife was quoted as saying, 
        “He was enamored of fatherhood.” He wanted nothing more than to be at 
        home with his new daughter.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There was the fireman who also loved to paint. There 
        was the police officer who spoke four languages and worked part-time as 
        a translator. There was a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker. There 
        was a security guard who would feed the homeless every week at his Seventh 
        Day Adventist Church.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">These are the Missing, whose lives we try to narrate, 
        as we excavate them, piecemeal, from newspaper accounts. We see their 
        smiling faces everywhere on posters around town. These paper fliers, announcing 
        they are “Missing,” are tacked to walls, to store fronts, to light posts, 
        to telephone booths — the sexy glances of the “Missing” catch my eye as 
        I pass the New York Armory at Lexington.  The Armory was made an official 
        “Crisis Center” in the first days after September 11. Two blocks from 
        my apartment, it was the place to which family members were asked to bring 
        toothbrushes and hairbrushes, along with descriptions of their “Missing.” 
        Innovative family members brought fliers, too, then vied for the media 
        cameras and sensational spotlights that flooded street corners around 
        Lexington for days. They thrust their “Missing’s” smiling photograph into 
        the media’s face. They did not smile themselves.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Along the brick wall of the Armory, the fliers begin 
        to shred and peel.  The family members and the media are long gone. But 
        the “Missing” fliers remain, a shrill call for help. “Anyone know Diane?” 
        Or, “Call if you have information about William.” “Diane,” we learn, was 
        born in upstate New York in 1964. She would have been 38 years old when 
        she joined the Missing. A handsome man of 28, William, we learn, is a 
        father of two, who worked as an accountant on the north tower’s 92<sup>nd</sup> 
        floor. Call his wife if you have any information, his flier pleads. Information?  
        I have none. Increasingly whipped by fall winds, some of the letters in 
        “Missing”disintegrate, losing an “h” or an “n.” The faces of the “Missing,” 
        however, steadfastly smile on.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The hole where the World Trade Center stood is hallowed 
        ground. They are talking about making what was once the World Trade Center 
        a memorial site.  But, of course, they also want to rebuild Manhattan’s 
        prime office space; they want to rekindle the economic energy of a dying 
        downtown. Politicians speak out of two sides of their mouth, as the fragments 
        of the World Trade Center are moved in truckloads to a Staten Island city 
        dump site. There, on Staten Island, they sift for pieces of identifiable 
        objects. Retired police detectives and other volunteers pass gloved hands 
        tenderly through rubble moving along a conveyor belt. They feel for fragments 
        of a leather shoe or golden ring. On a good day, they find a warped police 
        badge or a credit card whose numbers are intact. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is the Amazing Grave of Staten Island, where 
        they also find pieces of bone welded to fragments of fabric and steel. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><strong>Coda</strong></p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is the evening of October 11, 2001.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Tonight, for the first time, I went down to the World 
        Trade Center. To where the World Trade Center once stood.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I went not as a tourist, and not to gawk.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I went to honor the dead who were my neighbors. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I went to Fulton Street and Broadway, where, over 
        the grid-like barriers, the still-standing high rises are masked with 
        huge protective canvas nets like veils of mourning, and where “rescue 
        workers,” who are really rubble diggers, make their way further into a 
        hole I cannot glimpse from Fulton and Broadway, whose cavernous place 
        I can only imagine. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I see the blown-out bits of what must have been World 
        Trade Center 7.  Beyond, I see a hulk of steel that I recognize from newspaper 
        photographs, the remnants of one of the towers.  It does not look like 
        a tower at all. It looks like giant shark teeth propped against a faded 
        sun.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The light becomes, for an instant, falsely luminous, 
        and the twisted gauntlet of steel turns purple, then is shot by rays of 
        pink. Red lights flow on the surface of the Hudson, which one now sees 
        from Fulton and Broadway. Then, red flecks reach the shark’s teeth, more 
        surreal than real.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">More nightmarish than dreamlike. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To face the vanishing lights, the traces, of the 
        World Trade Center, I confront the hole I cannot see. The sun dips its 
        belly into the fullness of the new horizon. There are dark eddies and 
        swells and pools. Then the Hudson deepens and becomes part of the sea.</p>
