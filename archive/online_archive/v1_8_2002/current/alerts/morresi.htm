        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Women build meaning around clots of silence: when 
          I read De Lauretis’s considerations on women’s creative genealogies and 
          their proximity with silence I realized that she had translated into words 
          what had always been so indefinable and yet substantial to me. <i>Grumi 
          di silenzio</i>. I felt shrinking back to the little horrors of my adolescence. 
          The unsaid / silence. My father saying <i>seduzione</i> for rape, my mother 
          remarking upon my shoes to say “I care” (was it that?), my sister, so 
          impenetrable behind her books, my lies made of fear (of showing myself) 
          and of desire (of inventing myself). Silence was a well-known place then: 
          there I would find rest (there I would count my monsters). An escape from 
          absence, the silence of silence; yet, a very narrow place indeed. The 
          contradiction was poignant: a feeling of confinement roused by the vastness 
          of the unspoken. To force the trap open I started to practice in the detonation 
          of words.</P>
        <p style='line-height:
  200%'>Reading is always a personal experience, but, given the premise, for me 
          reading <i>We Who Love To Be Astonished</i> has also been a private one: 
          an encounter with other workers of words who share an interest in expanding 
          the self beyond the borders and frames imposed by dominant culture. </p>
        <p style='line-height:
  200%'>The areas of interest and practice of the women writers presented in this 
          book are as diverse as the methodologies of the critics who discuss them 
          but the varieties of feminist thought and poetics emerging from the collection 
          have at least one shared concern: subversion. This means that existing 
          ways of knowing are questioned and new poetic practices and new theoretic 
          approaches are investigated. The explorations, indifferent to conventional 
          boundaries between disciplines and genres, turn the page into a stage, 
          where desire and bewilderment are cherished as the vital sources of the 
          possible. </p>
        <p style='line-height:
  200%'>The poets presented in <i>We Who Love To Be Astonished</i> are usually easily 
          marginalized by the dominant culture that erase their contexts and connections 
          and fix them in isolated compartments imposing a fundamentalist view of 
          identity politics, one that represents subjects and communities as monoliths 
          and their members as deaf and blind to any outer contact. The primary 
          goal of the book is to trace the common ground and the contiguities of 
          a number of writers and to promote cross-pollination between them. In 
          addition to this, <i>We Who Love </i>explores the ways in which avant-garde 
          women writers, while resisting to modernist formalism and escapism and 
          avoiding conventional models that may reinforce conventional thinking, 
          try to combine aesthetic experiment with an awareness of their social 
          and political existence. Poets rarely discussed together are here put 
          in conversation with one another: the combination is exciting and encourages 
          new and fruitful exchanges. </p>
        <p style='line-height:
  200%'>The book is organized in five parts: “Formal Thresholds” (on Kathleen Fraser, 
          Rae Armantrout, Alice Notley, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge), “The Margins of 
          Form” (on Denise Chávez, Harryette Mullen, Rosmarie Waldrop, Joy Harjo, 
          Lyn Hejinian, Kathy Acker), “The Visual Referent / Visual Page” (on Norma 
          Cole, Anne Lauterbach, Fanny Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Susan Howe, Erica Hunt, 
          Alison Saar), “Performative Bodies” (on Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Kathy Acker, 
          Anne Waldman, Tracie Morris, Jayne Cortez) and the afterword, “Draft 48: 
          Being Astonished” by Rachel Blau DuPlessis. At first the titles and order 
          of the chapters might be misleading: they seem to illustrate a development 
          from the abstract to the physical. No such dichotomy takes place. The 
          division is based upon types of experiment, not on mind / body hierarchies: 
          from experiment in the experience of language, the investigation of received 
          traditions and received notions of what is center and what is margin, 
          the re-inscription of patriarchal tradition, to the multiplication of 
          referents, the complexity of interconnections, the explosion of boundaries 
          and the exploration of hybridity. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This is a much-needed work. As the editors themselves 
          observe in the introduction, the threads created in this book will help 
          to re-imagine the role of avant-garde writing, “threads bearing not only 
          formal instruction and cultural history, but also aesthetics practices 
          and political tools.”</p>
