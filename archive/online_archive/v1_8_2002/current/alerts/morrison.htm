        </P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Rusty Morrison</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Valerie Coulton is a poet intent upon the material 
          presence of language. She brings our attention to the heft and sway of 
          words freed from being simply functionaries in the fiefdom of language 
          transmission and opens us to their enigmatic moods, their dalliances of 
          sound and shape. Her deft management of page space, and her fearlessness 
          in the face of logic’s seeming occlusion, foreground a word’s tonally 
          sensual presence. Hers is a poetry in which we feel language breathe — 
          expanding with meaning’s excesses, freed from the proscriptions of our 
          social/cultural uses and practices.&nbsp;</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In<i> Passing World Pictures, </i>Coulton infuses 
          her own spare, sensate choices of language with phrases from a 1946 pre-war 
          guidebook to Japanese culture, which was written for western tourists 
          visiting Japan. We’ve all experienced the humor and poignancy of meanings 
          lost or strangely altered in translations by non-native speakers who are 
          not fully fluent in the subtleties of English, and Coulton occasionally 
          plays upon such feelings. But Coulton does not focus upon what logic is 
          lost in such translation, rather she is adept at using the gaps to find 
          glimpses of what transpires outside the trance of our particular language 
          — the trance which holds each of us within our culture’s paradigmatic 
          sway. With this poet, we enter language’s flush and copious foreignness, 
          catch it in the act of its shifting difference. It is as if Coulton were 
          opening&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>a box with divisions&nbsp;<br>
            until later times<br>
            and hung through the wearer’s sash&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By embracing the strangeness of such seemingly simple, 
          direct diction, we begin to develop a sixth sense for apprehending what 
          passes otherwise unseen among the “world pictures” we believe our speaking 
          creates, glimpses of what we might otherwise ignore &nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>for polishing a nipple&nbsp;<br>
            in the small space available&nbsp;<br>
            between this word and the next&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">a “small space,” but large enough for us to encounter 
          within it all the immediacy and evanescence of our “passing world.” Coulton 
          demonstrates a Mallarmé-ian acuity for balancing phrases upon the page’s 
          expanse in poised receptivity to that enigmatic “passing world.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Such acuity also appears in the work of poets like 
          Barbara Guest and Kathleen Fraser whose placement of language upon the 
          page disrupts the camouflage of typical grammatical sense, exposing what 
          otherwise lies hidden behind the forward motion of typical lineation. 
          As Bruce Andrews suggests when discussing such alternative awareness — 
          “Atmospherically: what surrounds words may be more readily, and satisfyingly 
          perceived than an iron cage of connection . . .” (<i>The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E 
          Book</i>, 33).&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But I am not suggesting that Coulton’s is a poetics 
          which ignores the presence in discourse of that “iron cage of connection.” 
          Many of her phrases point toward rhetorics of meaningful connection ranging 
          from sexual politics to the search for transcendence. But Coulton engages 
          this array of sociological and metaphysical issues using language which 
          we encounter surprisingly, sensually, as if “hung through a wearer’s sash 
          . . .” Do not try to tie these ideas too tightly to the logic of intellectual 
          study. Instead, Coulton would ask us to wear these poems loosely knotted, 
          to move with their fluidity, so as to experience both a sensate shock 
          and delight in their&nbsp; instrument’s stolen belly</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>of all supernatural<br>
            </i>wish women<br>
            <i>robe of feathers<br>
            </i>bronze, tulle, satin</p>
          <p>in making various objects</p>
          <p><i>joy</i></p>
          <p>delectable seaweed</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Coulton’s is a poetics rich with all manner of the 
          “delectable” — one finds it in the sensory yield of her language’s referents, 
          but most potently, most “joy”-fully in her relish of words themselves, 
          their material resonances and sonorous echoings between and beyond the 
          bars of the iron cage we make of syntax. With Coulton, there are alternatives 
          to such confinement; a sentence’s seeming inescapability might open into 
        </p>
        <p>an alley&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of fallen lanterns&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">H.D. (now famously) said to Marianne Moore, “I can’t 
          write unless I am an outcast.” Coulton gives us the sense of an outcast’s 
          experience — that of looking in upon an otherness of mores and meanings. 
          We feel the friction in the rub of otherness against otherness, of one 
          language against another, of one culture against another culture’s conventions 
          — a friction that sparks, consuming rote expectations in the fire of writing. 
          “Our minds, all of our minds,” says H.D. “are like dull little houses 
          . . . Outside is a great vineyard and grapes and rioting and madness and 
          dangers.” With Coulton, we enter a quieter, but no less fierce “rioting” 
          of difference, a</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>dried river<br>
            </i><i>stuffed with paper </i>&nbsp;<br>
            eating notes<br>
            to cure drought</p>
          <p><i>roughly translated </i></p>
          <p>“<i>I have disappeared</i>”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We emerge from such “roughly translated” language 
          intuitively conversant with the “disappeared” “I” and filled with such 
          hungers which “cure drought” and create a fertile undermine of the overly 
          ordering mind. In the fecundity of Coulton’s spare language, we find ourselves 
          traveling a translation beyond logic upon</p>
