        Folio for Fanny Howe”</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">(Ed. Paul Green, <i>Spectacular Diseases</i> 
        11 (2000): 3-126)</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Frances Presley</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This “folio,” within a special issue of the journal 
        <i>Spectacular Diseases</i>, contains a fine poem sequence by Fanny Howe, 
        “Q,” as well as some very interesting and complex responses to her work 
        by Rae Armentrout, Paul Green, Romana Huk, Peter Middleton and Clair Wills. 
        There is also a distinctive drawing of “Q” by Alan Halsey. 
      <p>“Q” is a short, tightly written sequence, which explores our itinerant 
        state as human beings: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>We moved to be happy.&nbsp;<br>
          Like a remote sensing tool, each body<br>
          in the family<br>
          adapted to earth’s urbanity, and travelled. (7)&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rae Armantrout writes about the way in which Howe 
        approaches the first person, or “speaking subject” (43), in “Q,” through 
        imagining herself as part of a nomadic collectivity. This nomadic, anarchic 
        collective also represents the serial poem itself: “the pilgrim / itinerant 
        self of Howe’s poem may sometimes be happy in her migratory, compositional 
        process, but she does not, in the end, find any utopian solution” (45), 
        as the gipsy-poet-Maternalist family is constantly in danger of being 
        broken apart. The sequence ends with the line, “I’m being split into the 
        longitude of one.” (37)&nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Many of Howe’s concerns, as well as her techniques 
        as a writer, appear in “Q.” All the contributors to this issue are concerned 
        with Howe’s approach to the first person. In contrast to Armantrout, Paul 
        Green emphasies the reclusive, hidden or fairy self in Howe’s work, and 
        the importance of becoming “the hidden one” (52) for the poem to succeed. 
        This act of seclusion is essential to the production of the text: “the 
        hidden parts of the poem have to remain so. They are like fairy grafts, 
        shoots of light, articulations of phonemes . . .” (60). Green also points 
        out that Howe is set apart, or marginalised, in her role as female poet, 
        with unconventional Catholic beliefs. He examines Howe’s religious beliefs, 
        and finds them both heretical and dependent upon the hidden “complicities” 
        (61) of her writing. I think it is a tribute to the richness of Howe’s 
        writing that it lends itself both to Armantrout’s emphasis on the collective 
        and Green’s emphasis on the reclusive. 
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I particularly like Green’s essay for its sensitive, 
        close reading of the text, paying tribute to “the dexterity involved in 
        the syntactics of her very lexical word play” (51). This dexterity is 
        present at all levels, from phoneme to theology. We are inevitably reminded 
        of Emily Dickinson when we read Howe, not least for her use of rhymes 
        and ditties: 
      <p></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>But still a story of something that almost came to be<br>
          the never-quite-but-hinted-at<br>
          attention of a Thee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(22)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Howe often uses rhymes and half-rhymes for metaphysical 
        ends — for example, in “Q,” she rhymes the “satanic wrist” of the airforce 
        with “maternalist” (25). &nbsp;</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If the various critics in this folio try to place 
        Fanny Howe in relation to contemporary poetry in her use of the subject, 
        they also try to place her in terms of her spiritualism. This is particularly 
        Romana Huk’s concern. She focuses on Howe’s <i>Introduction to the world 
        </i>(1985), a sequence of poems that “move within the delusional confines 
        of the text as ‘world’ in order to contemplate ‘God’ as the <i>space</i> 
        that underwrites writing...” (66).<i> </i>In a highly theoretical essay, 
        Huk draws both on Hebraic tradition and post-structuralism to define Howe’s 
        spiritualism. She claims that Howe is post-structuralist and Derridean 
        in her foregrounding of language “in its thingness and therefore the specific 
        <i>space</i> it makes for that which is other…” (72). In an interesting 
        and provocative conclusion, Huk states that Howe does not take the transcendent 
        position of the avant-garde poet in erasing the lyric self from the text; 
        nor that of transcendental theology; nor even that of Derridean philosophy 
        with its transhistorical view. Ironically, remarks Huk, Howe is less otherworldly 
        than any of these projects. This avoidance of the transcendental in Howe’s 
        work must be at least in part due to her inheritance from modernism; and 
        particularly the influence of William Carlos Williams, which is noted 
        both by Paul Green and Clair Wills. 
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Peter Middleton returns again to the use of the first 
        person in Howe’s work, and how it persists in spite of attacks by the 
        avant-garde. He sets out to show that Howe’s commitment to the first person 
        is valid in a way that its use by some other contemporary poets is not. 
        In a complex theoretical discussion, he also argues that Derrida’s theory 
        of self-consciousness may be inadequate as a way of describing a poetically 
        realised subjectivity, such as that found in Howe’s work: “We would do 
        much better to think of self-consciousness as both non-identical and at 
        the same time familiar with itself” (93). Like Huk, he sees Howe avoiding 
        “the ideological seizure of transcendence” (97) or any gradualised Platonic 
        shift. A large part of Middleton’s essay is given over to contrasting 
        Howe with other contemporary poets, particularly Louise Glück, in order 
        to critique the latter’s “firmly located self” (87). I felt rather uneasy 
        about this contrast, and kept wondering if the “I” in Glück’s work was 
        quite as self-satisfied, or as little ironised, as Middleton implies. 
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this context, the final contributor, Clair Wills, 
        takes quite a different and less combative, stance towards other uses 
        of the lyric voice in contemporary poetry. She is more sympathetic than 
        either Huk or Middleton to confessional poetry, and points out that its 
        poetic self is never simply autobiographical. She asserts that women poets 
        have been instrumental in questioning the notional opposition of the lyric 
        voice and avant garde writing. She picks out Howe’s self-avowed commitment 
        to the “charged vocabulary of a Romantic” (108), and goes further in recognising 
        the lyric, expressive impulse in her work than either Huk or Middleton. 
        Wills also sees Howe’s interest in the aesthetics of incarnation, the 
        moment of fusion of material and transcendent, as in opposition to the 
        concerns of other linguistically innovative writers. Unlike Middleton 
        she uses another contemporary poet, Meadbh McGuckian, for a positive comparison 
        with Howe. She states that although McGuckian’s poetry might appear “securely 
        autobiographical” (122), it is typically split between multiple voices, 
        and the “I” is oblique and elusive. McGuckian also shares with Howe a 
        sense of dislocation and exile, from within an Irish inheritance. However 
        (how / ever), Wills concludes, as Middleton does, by stressing the transformative 
        power of Howe’s writing, with perhaps the best concluding sentence:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The “unlonelying” of poetry, its reaching beyond the bounds of self, 
          is a process which the work enacts, rather than a state which may be 
          described” (126). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So read the poetry! </p>
