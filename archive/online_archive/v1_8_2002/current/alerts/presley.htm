          Folio for Fanny Howe”</P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER">(Ed. Paul Green, <i>Spectacular Diseases</i> 
          11 (2000): 3-126)</P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Frances Presley</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This “folio,” within a special issue of the journal 
          <i>Spectacular Diseases</i>, contains a fine poem sequence by Fanny Howe, 
          “Q,” as well as some very interesting and complex responses to her work 
          by Rae Armentrout, Paul Green, Romana Huk, Peter Middleton and Clair Wills. 
          There is also a distinctive drawing of “Q” by Alan Halsey. 
        <p>“Q” is a short, tightly written sequence, which explores our itinerant 
          state as human beings: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>We moved to be happy.&nbsp;<br>
            Like a remote sensing tool, each body<br>
            in the family<br>
            adapted to earth’s urbanity, and travelled. (7)&nbsp;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rae Armantrout writes about the way in which Howe 
          approaches the first person, or “speaking subject” (43), in “Q,” through 
          imagining herself as part of a nomadic collectivity. This nomadic, anarchic 
          collective also represents the serial poem itself: “the pilgrim / itinerant 
          self of Howe’s poem may sometimes be happy in her migratory, compositional 
          process, but she does not, in the end, find any utopian solution” (45), 
          as the gipsy-poet-Maternalist family is constantly in danger of being 
          broken apart. The sequence ends with the line, “I’m being split into the 
          longitude of one.” (37)&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Many of Howe’s concerns, as well as her techniques 
          as a writer, appear in “Q.” All the contributors to this issue are concerned 
          with Howe’s approach to the first person. In contrast to Armantrout, Paul 
          Green emphasies the reclusive, hidden or fairy self in Howe’s work, and 
          the importance of becoming “the hidden one” (52) for the poem to succeed. 
          This act of seclusion is essential to the production of the text: “the 
          hidden parts of the poem have to remain so. They are like fairy grafts, 
          shoots of light, articulations of phonemes . . .” (60). Green also points 
          out that Howe is set apart, or marginalised, in her role as female poet, 
          with unconventional Catholic beliefs. He examines Howe’s religious beliefs, 
          and finds them both heretical and dependent upon the hidden “complicities” 
          (61) of her writing. I think it is a tribute to the richness of Howe’s 
          writing that it lends itself both to Armantrout’s emphasis on the collective 
          and Green’s emphasis on the reclusive. 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I particularly like Green’s essay for its sensitive, 
          close reading of the text, paying tribute to “the dexterity involved in 
          the syntactics of her very lexical word play” (51). This dexterity is 
          present at all levels, from phoneme to theology. We are inevitably reminded 
          of Emily Dickinson when we read Howe, not least for her use of rhymes 
          and ditties: 
        <p></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>But still a story of something that almost came to be<br>
            the never-quite-but-hinted-at<br>
            attention of a Thee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(22)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Howe often uses rhymes and half-rhymes for metaphysical 
          ends — for example, in “Q,” she rhymes the “satanic wrist” of the airforce 
          with “maternalist” (25). &nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">If the various critics in this folio try to place 
          Fanny Howe in relation to contemporary poetry in her use of the subject, 
          they also try to place her in terms of her spiritualism. This is particularly 
          Romana Huk’s concern. She focuses on Howe’s <i>Introduction to the world 
          </i>(1985), a sequence of poems that “move within the delusional confines 
          of the text as ‘world’ in order to contemplate ‘God’ as the <i>space</i> 
          that underwrites writing...” (66).<i> </i>In a highly theoretical essay, 
          Huk draws both on Hebraic tradition and post-structuralism to define Howe’s 
          spiritualism. She claims that Howe is post-structuralist and Derridean 
          in her foregrounding of language “in its thingness and therefore the specific 
          <i>space</i> it makes for that which is other…” (72). In an interesting 
          and provocative conclusion, Huk states that Howe does not take the transcendent 
          position of the avant-garde poet in erasing the lyric self from the text; 
          nor that of transcendental theology; nor even that of Derridean philosophy 
          with its transhistorical view. Ironically, remarks Huk, Howe is less otherworldly 
          than any of these projects. This avoidance of the transcendental in Howe’s 
          work must be at least in part due to her inheritance from modernism; and 
          particularly the influence of William Carlos Williams, which is noted 
          both by Paul Green and Clair Wills. 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Peter Middleton returns again to the use of the first 
          person in Howe’s work, and how it persists in spite of attacks by the 
          avant-garde. He sets out to show that Howe’s commitment to the first person 
          is valid in a way that its use by some other contemporary poets is not. 
          In a complex theoretical discussion, he also argues that Derrida’s theory 
          of self-consciousness may be inadequate as a way of describing a poetically 
          realised subjectivity, such as that found in Howe’s work: “We would do 
          much better to think of self-consciousness as both non-identical and at 
          the same time familiar with itself” (93). Like Huk, he sees Howe avoiding 
          “the ideological seizure of transcendence” (97) or any gradualised Platonic 
          shift. A large part of Middleton’s essay is given over to contrasting 
          Howe with other contemporary poets, particularly Louise Glück, in order 
          to critique the latter’s “firmly located self” (87). I felt rather uneasy 
          about this contrast, and kept wondering if the “I” in Glück’s work was 
          quite as self-satisfied, or as little ironised, as Middleton implies. 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this context, the final contributor, Clair Wills, 
          takes quite a different and less combative, stance towards other uses 
          of the lyric voice in contemporary poetry. She is more sympathetic than 
          either Huk or Middleton to confessional poetry, and points out that its 
          poetic self is never simply autobiographical. She asserts that women poets 
          have been instrumental in questioning the notional opposition of the lyric 
          voice and avant garde writing. She picks out Howe’s self-avowed commitment 
          to the “charged vocabulary of a Romantic” (108), and goes further in recognising 
          the lyric, expressive impulse in her work than either Huk or Middleton. 
          Wills also sees Howe’s interest in the aesthetics of incarnation, the 
          moment of fusion of material and transcendent, as in opposition to the 
          concerns of other linguistically innovative writers. Unlike Middleton 
          she uses another contemporary poet, Meadbh McGuckian, for a positive comparison 
          with Howe. She states that although McGuckian’s poetry might appear “securely 
          autobiographical” (122), it is typically split between multiple voices, 
          and the “I” is oblique and elusive. McGuckian also shares with Howe a 
          sense of dislocation and exile, from within an Irish inheritance. However 
          (how / ever), Wills concludes, as Middleton does, by stressing the transformative 
          power of Howe’s writing, with perhaps the best concluding sentence:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The “unlonelying” of poetry, its reaching beyond the bounds of self, 
            is a process which the work enacts, rather than a state which may be 
            described” (126). </p>
        </blockquote>
