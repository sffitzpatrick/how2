        <P CLASS="TITLE1" ALIGN="CENTER"><em>Hinge: A BOAS Anthology</em>, ed. Lauren 
          Schiffman, Crack Press, <br>
          2002) </P>
        <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Jeanne Heuving</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For whom does one write?</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For the eight women writers publishing their work 
          in <i>Hinge</i>, collectively known as BOAS (Bitches of All Seasons), 
          they write for each other. BOAS (formerly GOS, Girls of Summer, and WOW, 
          Women of Winter) came into existence as an association of like-minded 
          writers in San Francisco. They met to eat “good food,” to “chat” and to 
          discuss “writing and the writer’s place in the world.”</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the working notes that follow the writers’ selections 
          of works, several comment on BOAS. Erin Wilson remarks, “I don’t think 
          of BOAS, I think of eight separate women. What I push for, reach for, 
          desire, I find in us.” Laura Shiffman draws attention to the rare possibilities 
          of saying “<i>cock</i> and <i>pussy</i> in a room full of seven politely 
          listening women.” She comments, “I wouldn’t have finished [“Mirror Mirror: 
          The Cock Poems”] without [. . .] the go-ahead to write lots of dirty words 
          on the page and the strength to be vulnerable in the work.” </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At the beginning of the century, Virginia Woolf had 
          cause to remark on the revolutionary moment in a novel in which she read, 
          “Chloe liked Olivia.” For Woolf this remark heralded the moment when literary 
          works could focus on (and therefore construct and value) relations between 
          women. Previously, as Woolf understood it, women only existed in novels 
          in their relations to men. BOAS brings this possibility to the literary 
          coterie or to the avant garde collective, or to what Robert Creeley refers 
          to as his “company.” While history has given us a few famous women’s literary 
          coteries, Sappho’s lesbians and Paris of the Left Bank, still the possibilities 
          inherent in women’s literary explorations being done in the company of 
          like-minded women is more revolutionary than one might think.</P>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Norma Cole notes the book “presents a radically new 
          set of relations between the work of individuals and the work of the collective. 
          Don’t miss it!” [book jacket]. Indeed, in a world where literary market 
          places define endeavors (whether through MFA writing programs or publishing 
          venues) BOAS provided a rare commodity — a place where the writers’ work 
          could find resonance and build on itself. While such places are important 
          for all writers, they are particularly important for women writers who 
          must struggle to find and sustain the fertile liminality of their own 
          arrogance and vulnerability.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The book is exciting as a collective endeavor yielding 
          a set of mutually informed poetics and social observations as well as 
          a selection of individual works. Like other twentieth century innovative 
          work, it mines the place between writing and everyday life, but unlike 
          earlier work, such as say, William Carlos Williams’ <i>Spring and All</i> 
          or Lyn Hejinian’s <i>My Life, </i>there is less a need to mark out a territory, 
          to do battle with literary protocol. As Myung Mi Kim remarks in her introduction, 
          “This book is not a document. Rather it documents with ardor, with responsibility, 
          the confluence of writing and everyday life.”</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Kim’s commentary is a telling introduction to this 
          work, calling into the foreground the way that these writers do “document” 
          their lives, with the difference that “ardor” can make. Living as we do 
          in a time inundated with powerful (and exciting) new information technologies, 
          it is precisely their challenge that “creative writers,” for lack of a 
          better term, must address. These writers meet this challenge by making 
          their own lives their place of investigation (having unprecdented access 
          to these sites) and by bringing their existences into new relief through 
          subtle verbal exploration. Stefani Barber writes of “resisting the narrative 
          that asserts” and Elise Ficarra tells of learning from BOAS, “don’t knock 
          too heavily on the door and hammer it shut — let it swing on its hinges 
          [. . . ].” Jean Lieske presses Frank O’Hara’s “personism” into an enacted 
          processual relation: “I want to write you a letter. I mean, I’ll understand 
          you’re there // when I reach you in writing.”</p>
        <p></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I was particularly taken with the crossover between 
          prose and poetry throughout the volume, yielding a writing that can be 
          simultaneously svelte, austere, and rich. As Nicole Stefanko remarks about 
          her piece “Manta Ray”: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>At first, I thought of them as &#8220;skimming stories&#8221; that 
            would allow me to test the flatness or elasticity of prose &#8212; how 
            much or how little could live in the surface of the language, how much 
            could be thrown down on the page without judgment or explanation. Getting 
            as close to what I dreamt or day dreamt with as possible. Pretending 
            that I could type as fast as I could think &#8212; and what would happen 
            then, what would I see. Then I began to notice a lyrical intensity creeping 
            in. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Take for instance, this section in Stefanko’s “Manta 
          Ray”:</P>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>entanglements GORGEOUSNESS<br>

          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Or Jean Lieske in <i>Finn:</i></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i><br>
            </i>tredding was the trilling sound taken from<br>
            the hole like <i>thrilling</i> you found yourself<br>

            re-embrace — you sloughed off in pleasure<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Or Tsering Wangmo Dhompa in “Irreovcobaly so — a 
          poem beginning with k”:</P>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The four valves have their own labor. When shunting occurs in the wrong 
            direction, there is an alarm. A leaking valve develops its own conditions. 
            Sibilant.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Do read <i>Hinge. </i>As Sarah Rosenthal remarks 
          in an opening epigraph to <i>Hinge, </i>“i think of a door swinging on 
          hinges [. . .] i think of the passages between each other in the group, 
          and out to readers, and opening up possibilities for readers to (? what’s 
          beyond this) . . . what comes to mind for others?”</p>
