        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Spinoza in Her Youth</i>, the latest book by San 
          Francisco poet Norma Cole, collects several chapbooks together along with 
          some other work in a dizzying spectacle of verbal acrobatics. Cole’s work, 
          like the best of the Language School poetries with which her writing seems 
          connected, is invested in theory and syntactical mysteries but not at 
          the expense of joyful usage or raw energy. I admire the sheer adventure 
          of this collection — the poems heed to no particular form, playing with 
          punctuation, margins, type size, quotations, symbols, etc. and yet always 
          feeling carefully and craftily composed. As non-linear as these pieces 
          are, each is embedded with vivid moments of emotional clarity that also 
          comment on what it is to read / write a poem, as in the line “Let’s make 
          this page into an apartment, an enlightenment / structure like being inside 
          someone’s skull.” Some of my favorite lines in the book came in the prose 
          poems in the section “Desire &amp; Its Double,” which begins with an epigraph 
          from a work on Spinoza by Osamu Ueno: “The genius of Spinoza lies in having 
          discovered a secret liaison that connects . . . desire to its double. 
          I will try to shed some light on this.” The short prose poems, a cycle 
          of “Artificial Memories” and a cycle called “My Operatives,” are extremely 
          sharp and compelling; in the poem “Artificial Memory 5,” Cole writes “If 
          I’m quiet enough the bullet will go back into the gun, the boy will get 
          up, etc.” “Artifical Memory 10” reads, in its entirety, 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Two women in a café called The Magic Slate were discussing 
          a series of black and white photographs 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>of a baby sitting on a pool table holding a pool cue. Above the baby 
            was a familiar beer label, <i>Budweiser</i>, on a banner. People, students, 
            were using the terms <i>bourgeois</i> and <i>boudoir</i> interchangeably. 
            Others arrived at the airport saying “where’s the beach?” </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Cole has a delightful talent for illuminating the 
          crossroads of theory, language and humanity.</p>
        <p align="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A compact book easily read in one sitting, but also 
          easily returned to like a daily practice, Alice Jones’ <i>Extreme Directions</i> 
          takes as its form the positions of Tai Chi Sword, each explored in brief 
          poems. Jones explains that she “wanted the poems to evoke the movements’ 
          fluidity, like Chinese brush stroke paintings,” and this is exactly how 
          they feel: sudden and graceful. While no experience with tai chi is of 
          course necessary in order to read this book, I was glad that I had studied 
          it briefly, because it gave me a greater appreciation for the difficulty 
          of slow, precise movement that is also meant to be seamless: it is hard 
          to do physically, and perhaps even more of a challenge poetically. Jones 
          meets the challenge with fragment that evokes the Eastern while nonetheless 
          clearly rooted, feet flat on the floor, in American culture. My feeling 
          is that she occasionally falters by making the poems too Asian, as in 
          “<i>South-pointing needle</i>,” in which she writes “raise the shade and 
          look / the emboldened warrior / finds the black-haired maiden,” which 
          comes off a bit too <i>Crouching Tiger</i> for my taste, though one can 
          see how such images would be difficult to avoid in this book. Elsewhere, 
          the titles lead the poems in an unfortunately obvious way, so that the 
          result is transparently representative rather than suggestive; the poem 
          “<i>Rhinoceros gazes at moon</i>” begins “Large and unwieldy / ancient 
          and scaled / horn designates up.” But most of the poems in <i>Extreme 
          Directions</i> avoid such pitfalls, and are instead a happy meeting of 
          playfulness and meditation, transcendent and banal, like “<i>Rein horse</i>:”</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>OK, don’t fly<br>
            stay in the realm<br>
            of the probable<br>
            here<br>
            we can pay the bills<br>
            sorry again</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Or, in the sweet “<i>Block, sweep left and right</i>,” 
          “Are you Zorro in the morning / under the covers / unmasked?” Alice Jones’ 
          book evocatively renders the physical moment permanent in words.</p>
        <p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Liz Waldner’s <i>Etym(bi)ology</i> is that rare thing: 
          a work that surges with political fervor and also with joy, humor and 
          wild innovation. Unafraid to take on the topical and render it universal, 
          Waldner describes the book, whose poems date from the early 90s, as stemming 
          from her “curiousity about the construction of the concept of selfhood 
          in american culture, and the global effects of u.s. corporate-dominated 
          media” along with her “abiding interest in the representation of women.” 
          While the influence of Language poetry is evident here, the poems in <i>Etym(bi)ology</i> 
          are also frank and often disarmingly direct, as in the title poem, in 
          which she states “if more flat-chested women refrained from affixing silicone 
          bosoms, more flat-chested women could refrain from affixing silicone bosoms” 
          and then adds “(If no one were deciding the value of your being based 
          on the size of your breasts, it would be safer for women to go out at 
          night.)” I can’t remember the last time I read such resolutely honest 
          and straightforward (and funny) lines in a book of such formally avant-garde 
          poems. The syntactical leaps Waldner makes (“AND FATHER OF EUROPA / <i>o 
          syllable o footfall </i>/ her home was a very cold place she is sitting 
          alone, / mellifluous”), along with the uncanny accuracy of her strange 
          pronouncements about women and women’s poetics (“*Emily get yr gun, my 
          life has stood a / loaded, buffalo gals in Amherst, et al.”) and the down-to-earth 
          shimmy of the language (“He lets there be the sense of <i>yeah</i>— / 
          well, he lets there be that”) combine to form a utterly exciting and important 
          voice of particular interest to <i>How2</i> readers: this is a remarkable, 
          and remarkably female, experiment. </p>
