          Lewis is a young Australian poet currently living on the west coast of 
          the USA. Her new collection, <i>High Country</i>, follows a pamphlet of 
          ten poems <i>Song for the Quartet</i> (Melbourne: SOUP, Melbourne 1997), 
          and was published a little earlier than Potes &amp; Poets’ <i>Winter </i>District: 
          a booklet that combines work from both chapbooks together with some new 
          material. <i>High Country</i> is a distinctive looking book, with a black 
          &amp; white cover photo of wooded hills and vales subtly brushed by misty 
          chiaroscuro: the background to a dramatic sheer orange typeface for the 
          title and blurb. Its pocket-size format enhances the attractive, yet simple 
          design.</p>
   <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Cassie Lewis’s emotional range is broad — nothing here is solely elegiac, 
      although, on first appearances a reader may think so. The opening quotation 
      from John Giorno reads, “<i>With a brilliant sun causing his tears/to glitter 
      like strange jewels</i>”</p>
    
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">But moving into the poetry soon reveals the application of an analytical process 
    that restrains any saccharine sentiment. From the title poem:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    This lake, a toy for wilderness, a call to other duties.<br>
      What would hope do to me if I couldn’t stare it out ?<br>
      Hear it moving like washing foam, like drunken vowels.<br>
      Past the verandah, fresh snow grazing on astonished winter flowers.<br>
      I look on. At how the heart connects to things like crazy ivy<br>
      And how days are unbroken.</div>
  </blockquote>
   
    <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Cassie Lewis’s poetry has a modulated quality. These poems are considered, 
      thorough. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Rhythm, sometimes a ponderous or old-fashioned notion 
          in contemporary poetry, is essential to Lewis’s method and is revivified 
          in this set of poems. The pace is measured so that nothing overtly irruptive 
          or experimental occurs. Her writing is temperate, thoughtful, gently psychological, 
          and definitely coded, accumulating like a series of notes to a poetic 
          self, as seen in this excerpt from <i>Temple</i>:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    Waking up to whitewashed plasterboard,<br>
      jettisoned by my pride I grew<br>
      to love this: because this was the only way<br>
      I could continue. How the tide repealed us,<br>
      Then erased itself. Maybe the house,<br>
      With its palm trees, was more alive than I was.
  </blockquote>
   
    
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"> Cassie Lewis engages with ‘the elements’ as distinct from ‘the weather,’ and 
    this and her attention to detail and her interest in the descriptive is sometimes 
    reminiscent of another Australian poet, Judith Beveridge. Especially in the 
    poem <i>Denouement</i>:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>cold wind,<br>
            rain, slant-wise and hard.<br>
            I am visited by shadows<br>
            crossing over the fields<br>
            with their angry crops and wildflowers<br>
            struggling for prominence,<br>
            bristling over the horizon<br>
            like stubble on a man. Elsewhere,<br>
            rifling through leaves of sunlight<br>
            or standing resolute on a bank of sand,<br>
            you set up an echo as you shout my name.<br>
            But here the wind devours all outside voices;</blockquote>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is an undercurrent thread of ‘Australianness’ 
          in these poems: </p>
      
   
  <blockquote>
    <p>Down the opal mines he is leaning on cool rock and<br>
      taking a smoko</p>
  </blockquote>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And in one poem, <i>Mandolin</i>,<i> </i>Cassie Lewis sounds like the late 
    John Forbes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Way of poppies, I climb upstairs — hurts to think,<br>
      bliss to move. And I won’t dispute a cigarette<br>
      on the famous corner. Hummingbirds; stars.<br>
      I never saw how two hemispheres breathe differently.<br>
      Are hamlets of equal worth, is globalisation a mirage?<br>
      An antidote to poetry could be spring in America —<br>
      cures that make us stronger, champions of all we crave.
  </blockquote>
  
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Almost ten years ago, as a teenager, Cassie Lewis 
          responded to a handwritten note posted in the window of an inner-city 
          Melbourne bookshop offering poetry lessons at an hourly rate from “John 
          Forbes, Australian Poet.” John directed Cassie towards poets like Frank 
          O’Hara, Ted Berrigan and David Shapiro among others. Cassie credits Shapiro’s 
          poem <i>For the Princess Hello </i>with having symbolically propelled 
          her to first publication. John Forbes commented to Cassie that poetry 
          should “look out, not in” — that by looking out you discover what’s in 
          you. This suggests a view that poetry is linked continually to a state 
          of consciousness or that the act of making poems involves a kind of extension 
          of consciousness. This confident first collection, <i>High Country</i>, 
          reflects and tests that suggestion faithfully.</p>
