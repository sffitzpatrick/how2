          <div class=Section1> 
            <div class=Section1>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Judging from the available critical literature 
                on Lola Ridge, <i>Firehead </i>is probably one of Ridge’s least 
                discussed works (my guess, though, as I’ve learned with much writing 
                from this period, is that as soon as I write this, five or six 
                separate studies will appear!). Even in extensive discussions 
                of Ridge’s work, such as Nancy Berke’s <i>Women Poets on the Left, 
                </i>there are often only one or two paragraphs devoted to the 
                text. <i>Firehead </i>is Ridge’s second-to-last verse collection; 
                Nancy Berke and William Drake both report that Ridge wrote this 
                long poem during a six-week stay at Yaddo in the summer of 1929 
                (Berke 40, Drake 199), in response to the 1927 execution of anarchists 
                Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. The speed with which this 
                poem was written places it in a tradition of other quickly written 
                long poems of the period, such as Margaret Walker’s “For My People,” 
                first published in <i>Poetry </i>in 1937, suggesting that poets 
                felt a sense of emergency and purpose toward their work of responding 
                to social and political injustice.  Suffice it to say, however, 
                that <i>Firehead </i>is a particularly difficult text to talk 
                about for a variety of reasons. Critics looking for Ridge’s most 
                “political” work will look to earlier books, such as <i>The Ghetto 
                and Other Poems; </i>and readers more interested in Ridge’s evolving 
                mysticism will look to her last book, <i>Dance of Fire</i>. To 
                a large extent, <i>Firehead</i> serves as thematic, linguistic, 
                and contextual bridges for Ridge between these two impulses.  
                In this more-than-200-page poem, Ridge experiments with a variety 
                of lyric techniques.  She further investigates her feelings about 
                mass social movements, her own commitment to anarchism, and her 
                growing interest in communism as a social movement through her 
                exploration of Christ’s seduction of individual apostles and of 
                “the multitude” to carry out His work of “brotherhood.” And although 
                this is the story of a male hero, Ridge’s vision in this poem 
                is decidedly feminist.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While <i>Firehead </i>is a retelling of Christ’s 
                crucifixion and essentially a response to “perhaps the twentieth 
                century’s worst miscarriage of justice” (Berke 53), the execution 
                of Sacco and Vanzetti, not all critics agree on the extent to 
                which we must read <i>Firehead </i>as either a politicized or 
                a spiritual and emotional response. Nancy Berke claims <i>Firehead 
                </i>“refigures Christ as our most famous victim of institutionalized 
                murder” and that “Ridge is not concerned with Christ’s body as 
                it is embraced and contemplated in Christian ritual. She is interested 
                in refiguring the martyred body through its symbolic subjectivity 
                as another politicized body in pain” (40).  I don’t believe it’s 
                as easy to distinguish between the politicized and the ritualized 
                body in this poem. Rather, I think Ridge wants to do both, to 
                ritualize the politicized body or bodies of the many players in 
                this story and to suffuse each body with its political, often 
                feminized, often heroic value. William Drake describes <i>Firehead 
                </i>in much more spiritual terms<i> </i>as signifying “the divine 
                spirit in humanity, burning fiercely, destructive to complacency 
                or to the entrenched powers that resist it. The creative spirit, 
                in bringing into the world something new and valuable, was itself 
                not innocent of violence” (199). Indeed, Ridge undercuts almost 
                every biblical story with the “true” story of each of the characters’ 
                jealousies and obsessions, which are forms of inner violence — 
                she depicts Mary Magdalene’s long-standing jealousy of the much-loved 
                disciple, John; Judas’s jealousy of Mary Magdalene for the pureness 
                of her love for Jesus; even Mary’s (Christ’s mother’s) jealousy 
                of Jesus’s followers and his passion for those followers. Ridge’s 
                feminist convictions are revealed in her many inversions of stories 
                she tells as well. But she does not completely secularize the 
                event of Christ’s crucifixion. For example, Ridge’s treatment 
                of the Holy Spirit, which remains for me one of the strangest 
                and most difficult of Christian concepts to grasp, is visceral. 
                The Holy Spirit becomes as idiosyncratic a character in this story 
                as Judas or John. Ridge favors one famous biblical tale of the 
                Holy Spirit’s power, its infiltration of the body of Peter, the 
                apostle responsible for institutionalizing Christianity, over 
                the story more often chosen by women writers, the insemination 
                of Mary:</p>

              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As the quote above begins to show, <i>Firehead 
                </i>is also important to consider in terms of the hybrid nature 
                of lyric in modernist political poetry of the period. Ridge intersperses 
                a variety of soft and strong end rhymes with long, free verse 
                lines, and short rhyming couplets, throughout the poem. On the 
                Modern American Poetry website coordinated by Cary Nelson, Donna 
                Allego describes <i>Firehead </i>as a “prose poem.” The temptation 
                to describe it as prose has much to do with the poem’s strong 
                narrative thread. But the poem is also filled with almost Shakespearean 
                dramatic monologues with all of the archaic language that goes 
                with this form, and cinematic flashbacks and theatrical hallucinations 
                and asides that reveal the interiority of each of the characters 
                involved in this story. The difficulty to name or to define Ridge’s 
                range of prosodic techniques may also have to do with our own 
                contemporary inability and discomfort with modernist political 
                writing of the 1920s and 1930s that bridged so many genres and 
                systems of intellectual classification. Joseph Harrington notes 
                in <i>Poetry and the Public </i>that a “strange combination” of 
                work that was modern and derivative “was not unusual in the 1910 
                and 1920s as it would seem for later generations” (128). Even 
                in Ridge’s time critics ranged in their response to her inconsistent 
                poetics and her “antiquated diction” (as Horace Gregory and Marya 
                Zaturenska characterized Ridge’s use of language in their entry 
                on Ridge’s work in <i>A History of American Poetry 1900-1940). 
                </i></p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In addition to Ridge’s odd lyricism that 
                bounces between rhyming couplets, dramatic monologues, and almost 
                free, but cadenced Whitmanian verse (most clearly seen in the 
                “Peter” section of the poem), I am drawn in my own most current 
                reading of this poem to Ridge’s gendered and highly sexualized 
                and sensualized anthropomorphic descriptions of nature and religious 
                phenomenon, her use of high and often misplaced diction at unexpected 
                moments, and her tirelessly extended metaphors. The poem is of 
                great interest in terms of the history of women’s radical poetry 
                of the period, as well, for its allegiance to what was in 1929 
                already fast becoming an anachronistic poetess-like lyric style 
                in the service of clearly un-lady-like material. Here is an example 
                of a highly wrought Romantic diction in service of a bloody story:</p>

              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As Andreas Huyssen reminds us in After the 
                Great Divide, the masses were often figured as female in modernist 
                literature, and the repulsion of these masses was enacted by many 
                modernist artists as repulsion of the female body. Here, Ridge&#8217;s 
                feminized language investigates that anxiety of Christ&#8217;s 
                association with the masses; images and words like &#8220;menopause&#8221; 
                and &#8220;curving spine&#8221; as well as &#8220;ooze&#8221; 
                and &#8220;pus&#8221; resonate around this depiction of Christ 
                suffering on the cross; thus Ridge inverts this modernist anxiety 
                and associates Christ's heroic body with the feminine body, whether 
                that body is victimized and degraded, or triumphant. </p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Ridge’s language ranges from wildly extravagant 
                grammatical usages of words such as “The day was <i>arteried </i>with 
                fire” (emphasis mine) (17) to graphic moments such as the nature 
                oozing a pus we see in the quote above, emphasized by its position 
                and rhyme with “venomous,” as well as the heightened vocabulary 
                one might find in other high modernist poems of the era. There 
                are cynosures (53) and diapasons (43), bantlings (155) and threnes 
                (156).</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Whether or not a contemporary reader fights 
                against the tide of this language or revels in it, the individual 
                stories remain compelling. Almost all the characters describe 
                their seduction by Jesus. And Jesus’s charisma is always associated 
                with his anarchist spirit. John says:</p>

              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Myrenne, the mother of Thaddeus, an early 
                convert to Christianity, will say of Jesus, “he hath raped my 
                son out of my womb!” just as she grudgingly accepts Christ’s radical 
                views: “He did speak / Of woman as a man might of his own friends!” 
                (165) and he “proclaimed all men were brothers” (169). Many characters 
                share this grudging passion for Christ in Ridge’s version of the 
                story. Even Mary, his mother, talks about Christ’s relationship 
                to the crowd, the mass, the multitude as of more importance to 
                him, more vitality, than whatever he could feel in intimate relationships: 
                “Only a multitude could fan his eyes / To that deep blaze of tenderness” 
                (134). It’s interesting to note that the story of Jesus’s life 
                is told almost exclusively by Mary; she is the only character 
                to whom Ridge extends this kind of narrative authority. In the 
                final part of Mary’s section, which has been mainly in free verse, 
                the lines break down, or perhaps break out into, a nursery rhyme 
                rhythm, as Mary reasserts her maternal rights over Jesus’s now 
                dead body, “swaddle him downily     hide him from sight / wash 
                his pale hands in the milk of the light / hush his wild tongue    
                on the strings of the sky / sounding its stammering fifth      
                let him lie” (146). So that rather than formal verse tightening 
                its hold on this section, the verse is used to radicalize the 
                Christian paternal vision by returning power to the maternal figure.</p>
              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One of the final characters Ridge portrays 
                is the artist figure, Tiro, an “image maker of Sicily / Who was 
                slave of Saius, captain of Pilate’s guard” on his own now because 
                Saius has become “meat for the dogs”. Tiro stands in for Ridge 
                and her fellow artists who attempted to respond to the extended 
                shock of Sacco and Vanzetti’s execution:</p>

              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps Ridge wondered if she were too late 
                with her image, her song. And if she could trust “the people” 
                to respond to it. This poem is important, finally, because it 
                expresses so well Ridge’s variety of feelings toward and confidence 
                in mass movements. In <i>Firehead, </i>Ridge alternatively describes 
                people pejoratively as a “crowd” or “mob” who condemned Jesus 
                to death, or more benevolently as “the people” or “a multitude”—“The 
                infinite murmur of the multitudes / That run out of their doors 
                from a stone’s eaves” (59) seduced and convinced by Jesus’s philosophy. 
                The section called “Peter” establishes the connection between 
                the “hero” and the masses. And Peter questions whether he can 
                maintain the relationship:</p>

              <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Nancy Berke quotes a portion of a letter 
                Ridge wrote to her husband in 1923 that pertains well to the convictions 
                Ridge explores in <i>Firehead</i>: “I’m not a pacifist and am 
                an individualist and I know individuals will always rule, no matter 
                what the society . . . even in a democracy. . . . Just now I think 
                the communists are more fit to rule than any other group, but 
                I tremble to think o f the result once the greater part of the 
                world has become communist” (quoted in Berke at 53). As an anarchist, 
                Ridge had great confidence in individual free will to guide governments 
                and politics. But she must also have wavered in her confidence 
                that once gathered, well-meaning individuals would make the right 
                decisions. It was clear by 1927 that mass movements could quickly 
                spurn mob violence, and conversely, that individuals could feel 
                themselves inert and powerless in the face of injustice. <i>Firehead,</i> 
                then, serves as a link between political and mystical writing 
                for Ridge. It enables Ridge to work out some of her feelings about 
                anarchism and communism by way of her representations of Jesus 
                toward the “masses.” It also reveals Ridge’s commitment toward 
                an ever-complex gendered and class vision of human liberation.
