        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>Leaving Lines of Gender </i>(2000), Ann Vickery 
          announces an ambitious project, a cartography of women’s experimental 
          poetry that attends first and foremost to its “practice,” that is, the 
          specific modes, means, and occasions of its production. For Vickery, 
          elucidating poetic practice does not imply a retreat into an ahistorical 
          formalism. On the contrary, it “involves reframing many aspects of . 
          . . poetic practice in order to link text with context”: 
      <blockquote> 
        Aspects that must be addressed include the multiple 
          text (its written or performed versions), the text-in-process (drafting, 
          editing, and reprinting), the relationship between readers and the text, 
          the use of particular poetic forms, the structure of small-press culture 
          and its marketplace, and the social politics of poetry (as manifested 
          in how poetic communities relate to one another and the individuals). 
          These may be further contextualized in larger social and cultural structures, 
          including the media and pedagogic institutions. (15)
      </blockquote>
      
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Exploring “the shifting ‘mess’ that encapsulates 
          actual poetic practice” serves a dual function. On the one hand, it 
          “maps out interweaving, multiple lines of affiliation” in all their 
          complexity, thereby forestalling falsely reductive or atomistic treatment 
          of experimental writing by women. On the other hand, it charts “the 
          debates arising out of difference, whether these be regional, aesthetic, 
          cultural, or ideological.” Highlighting “difference” in this manner 
          exposes the partiality or strategic blindspots in totalizing accounts 
          of contemporary innovative verse (13).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Inspired by Vickery’s turn to “practice” as a means 
          of clarifying recent literary history, this essay extends her cartographic 
          enterprise into new territory. It closely examines the writerly practice 
          of Rosmarie Waldrop, who has not only enjoyed three decades’ prominence 
          as an American experimental poet but who has also actively promoted 
          avant-garde literature as a publisher (Burning Deck Press), as a teacher 
          (Brown University), and as a translator (of Elke Erb, Helmut Heissenbütttel, 
          Edmond Jabès, and many other post-World War II Continental writers).<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [1] </span></a> Moreover, a German immigrant to the United States, Waldrop 
          has proved throughout her career to be exceptionally sensitive to the 
          displacements, imbalances, and transpositions instigated by movement 
          between nations, cultures, and languages. Her poetry is resolutely hybrid 
          — “between,” as she would say — as well as thoroughly secular and skeptical, 
          preferring wit to ecstasy, insight to murkiness, and precision to evocative 
          vagueness. An inquiry into Waldrop’s compositional practice exposes 
          the degree to which American innovative writing remains implicated in 
          the trans-Atlantic crossings, collisions, and dispossessions that mark 
          and mar so much of the country’s past. Waldrop seeks through her writing 
          a means of dwelling creatively, sustainingly in this chaotic, contested 
          terrain.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This essay follows Vickery in its preference for 
          thick description of the specifics of poetic practice — in this case, 
          of “text-in-process,” “the relationship between readers and the text,” 
          and “the use of particular poetic forms” as well as the “larger social 
          and cultural structures” which constitute their horizon. Collage, one 
          of Waldrop’s favorite writerly devices, is well known for its ability 
          to destabilize textual boundaries, unsettle authorship, transgress generic 
          distinctions, and otherwise dramatize writing’s refusal to buttress 
          any system of knowledge univocally and unequivocally; by exploring how, 
          when, and why Waldrop adopted a collage-based aesthetic, one begins 
          to perceive the “affiliations” and “differences” that demarcate the 
          consequent purpose, value, and function of the technique in her verse. 
          Moreover, as Vickery predicts, this close scrutiny of poetic practice 
          exposes both “unpredictable relationships” and “hidden or elided” distinctions 
          within the field of present-day experimental writing. Although a complete 
          picture of how Waldrop’s use of collage situates her in relation to 
          her contemporaries — and how this network of relations has in turn manifested 
          itself in what Vickery calls the “social politics of poetry” — will 
          have to await further study and elaboration, this essay makes it possible 
          to discern key pieces of that future account (15). Unlike, say, Susan 
          Howe, whose use of collage signals her qualified participation in the 
          Pound-Olson tradition, Waldrop looks to alternative, Middle European 
          sources to give her the confidence to move through and beyond the ideogrammic 
          method of <i>The Cantos</i>. She employs collage less for its ability 
          to introduce the raw stuff of history into a poem than as a means of 
          encouraging her readers to compare, contrast, and otherwise interrogate 
          the strategies and assumptions at play in different discourses. Collage 
          enables her to transform “betweenness” from marginality to a mode of 
          intervention and critique. </p>
        
      <div align="center">I. </div>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 2001, Northwestern University Press reissued 
          Rosmarie Waldrop’s experimental fictions <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter 
          </i>and <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. In an introduction titled 
          “Between, Always,” Waldrop reports that these two novels represent more 
          than an interlude in a writing career devoted primarily to poetry. In 
          fact, she explains, they played indispensable roles in the development 
          of her principle art form. <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i> marks 
          the end to a phase in her career as a poet, insofar as it enabled her 
          to escape from a compositional rut. More specifically, it provided her 
          with a capaciousness of form that made it possible for her to explore 
          viable alternatives to fast-moving, short-line, syntactically ambiguous 
          mode that had come to predominate in her verse in the later 70s and 
          early 80s (viii).<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [2] </span></a> In contrast, Waldrop attributes to <i>A Form / of Taking 
          / It All</i> the status of a new beginning. In this mixed-genre piece 
          she chose to make “Collage, juxtaposition . . . the heart of the book” 
          to a degree unparalleled in her earlier work. Although she had “used 
          collage before,” while writing <i>A Form</i> in the years 1983-1985 
          she hit upon an “art of separation and fusion, of displacement and connection” 
          that has served as the “main procedure” of her subsequent poetry, down 
          to the present day (xvi-xvii).<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [3] </span></a> </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s claim that the novel <i>A Form / of Taking 
          / It All</i> records an artistic turning point is rather surprising. 
          A jagged, four-part, prose-and-verse retelling of an impossible, “mystical 
          marriage” between Amy Lowell and Alexander von Humboldt, <i>A Form / 
          of Taking / It All </i>is an exceptional, even peculiar work within 
          Waldrop’s <i>oeuvre</i> that has received scant attention from reviewers, 
          critics, and other poets.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [4] </span></a> Its melodramatic treatment of Lowell’s and von Humboldt’s 
          “more or less suppressed homosexuality” yokes together sections written 
          in such disparate styles as stream of consciousness, commonplace book, 
          metafictional commentary, and free verse (xv). This rather unnerving 
          formal heterogeneity is matched by the incongruity of the book’s contents. 
          The concluding bibliography of sources lists textbooks on astronomy, 
          chemistry, and ballet; biographies of Beethoven and Napoleon; American 
          avant-garde poetry; Austrian avant-garde novels; histories of the Spanish 
          conquest of Mexico; the <i>WPA Guide to Washington, D.C.</i>; and a 
          technical manual for undertakers (<i>A Form </i>248). Reading <i>A Form 
          / of Taking / It All</i> at the time of its completion, one would have 
          been hard pressed to guess that Waldrop would soon turn to writing the 
          elegant, witty, erudite prose poetry that characterizes <i>Reproduction 
          of Profiles</i> (1987), <i>Shorter American Memory </i>(1988), <i>Lawn 
          of the Excluded Middle </i>(1993), and <i>Reluctant Gravities </i>(1999). 
        </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As Kornelia Freitag has pointed out, however, by 
          the time that she wrote “Unpredicted Particles,” the fourth part of 
          <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, Waldrop was already engaged in the 
          practice of selectively (mis)quoting Ludwig Wittgenstein’s writings 
          that would become a hallmark of these later writings.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [5] </span></a> The first page of “Unpredicted Particles” includes the 
          lines</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        “the grammar of the word ‘knows’<br>
          is closely related to that of<br>
          ‘mastery’” (237)
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">which, as Freitag informs us, derive from <i>Philosophical 
          Investigations</i> # 150: “The grammar of the word ‘knows’ is evidently 
          closely related to that of ‘can,’ ‘is able to’. But also closely related 
          to that of ‘understands’. (‘Mastery’ of a technique)” (“Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
          Language Games” 257). Omitting the softening “evidently” and all but 
          one word after “closely related to,” Waldrop transforms Wittgenstein’s 
          original, rather abstract statement into a Foucault-like observation 
          concerning the imbrication of knowledge and power. The next few lines 
          — “the difference / in a window / in Genoa” — rapid-fire connects the 
          Wittgenstein misquotation to several of the key themes in <i>A Form 
          / of Taking / It All</i>: representation (“in a window”), otherness 
          (“difference”), and the confrontation between European colonizers and 
          New World colonized (“Genoa,” an oblique reference to Columbus, who 
          will emerge as the protagonist of “Unpredicted Particles”) (237). In 
          short, Waldrop offers us a staccato reprise of the basics of postcolonial 
          theory, as articulated by Fritz Fanon, Gayatri Spivak, and an array 
          of other thinkers. While not as subtle or sophisticated as the responses 
          to Wittgenstein that would soon appear in Waldrop’s <i>Reproduction 
          of Profiles</i>, we can nonetheless observe here in germ the same general 
          methods of composition and commentary.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> thus deserves 
          scrutiny as a transitional work, prefiguring the philosophical and formal 
          preoccupations that mark Waldrop’s writings of the last fifteen years. 
          Moreover, it is uniquely appropriate to examine the process of “transition” 
          in Waldrop’s writing — especially when that examination necessitates 
          closer scrutiny of an aberrantly mixed-genre work. As she reminds us 
          in “Between, Always,” she “feel[s] a strong affinity for this word, 
          ‘between’” (which in fact served as the “title of one of [her] first 
          poems in English” )(vii).<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [6] </span></a> This sense of occupying an indefinite, intermediary 
          zone became particularly acute in the aftermath of writing <i>The Hanky 
          of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, which was initially received as “too ornate, 
          too metaphorical,” in short, too poetic to qualify as a straight-ahead 
          novel.</p>
      
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>I found myself in . . . [a] place between genres. 
          Between poem and novel. Between verse and prose.</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          Between two stools. A bad spot. Supposedly. Close to the middle excluded 
          by the law. Bud does a door have to be open or closed? All words are 
          ajar. Could I not settle in the between? Like most truly contemporary 
          writing? And could I not, like Luce Irigaray, make it not only a third 
          term between binaries but a locus of desire? Of encounter? Dynamic and 
          dynamite?</div>
        <div class=Section1><br>
          I went on to another novel — which, if we count the title, begins and 
          ends in verse. (xv)</div>
      </blockquote>
       
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In other words, <i>A Form / of Taking / It All 
          </i>— the novel she alludes to at the end of this passage — might be 
          through-and-through a jumbled, contradictory text. Even its title perplexes, 
          as Waldrop notes. Its combination of italics and virgules mixes codes 
          by suggesting, on the one hand, that “A Form of Taking It All” is the 
          name of a work of literature and, on the other hand, that the phrase 
          is a quotation from a lineated poem.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [7] </span></a> The book’s resolute refusal to resolve, its straining 
          at cross-currents, in short, its in-betweenness, is the very stuff of 
          Waldrop’s poetics. </p>
        <p align="center">II.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Between, Always” Waldrop reveals that the proximate 
          inspiration for her turn to collage in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> 
          was an innovative Austrian prose piece, Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des 
          Vitus Bering</i> (1965) (xv-xvi). This choice seems to have been dictated 
          by her desire to find a mode of writing that would permit a healthier 
          balance between critical distance and passionate personal investment 
          than she was able to achieve while writing <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s 
          Daughter</i>. In that earlier case, too, she had looked to Central European 
          precedents: Wittgenstein’s <i>Tractatus</i> and Johannes Bobrowski’s 
          <i>Levin's Mill: 34 Sentences About My Grandfather</i>. But her topic 
          — “the Nazi Germany into which I was born” — proved to be a “subject 
          so overwhelming, a knot of connections so complex” that these models 
          turned out to be wholly inadequate (ix). She resorted to an improvisational, 
          gap-filled manner of narration that required her to “put [her] trust 
          in language” and concentrate on the “rhythm” of delivery instead of 
          the shape of the work as a whole (xii). While she is satisfied with 
          the results, it nonetheless took her eight frustrating years to bring 
          the novel to completion (ix).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> 
          seems to have offered a tempting, alternative mode of writing: the deployment 
          of collage to create an absorbing narrative without having to agonize 
          over how to put into words one’s deepest thoughts and emotions.<i> </i>The 
          work’s thirty-odd pages recount the adventures of its eponymous hero, 
          the eighteenth-century explorer responsible for charting the waters 
          off Kamchatka and Alaska. Organized into short sections with italicized, 
          headline-like titles, the story consists almost entirely of passages 
          excerpted from other texts, chiefly memoirs, histories, and imaginative 
          literature. (An appendix conscientiously lists every source.) Many of 
          the passages that have been stitched together are digressive, whimsical, 
          or recalcitrantly unrelated to what comes before or after. As Bayer 
          explains in a preface, his goal in assembling <i>Der Kopf </i>was not 
          to produce a faithful reconstruction of actual events and personages. 
          Indeed, Bering the historical figure interests him far less than the 
          opportunities Bering affords for launching into other, juicy subjects: 
          he is “only a location . . . from which to establish relations, like 
          a fisherman casting a net in hopes of catching something” (168).<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [8] </span></a> </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The resulting crazy quilt is openly indebted to 
          pre-World War II European avant-garde practice. Bayer prominently cites 
          the Surrealist André Breton as an authority in his preface, and the 
          texture of its disjointed construction distinctly recalls <i>cadavre 
          exquis</i> (168). Indeed, if one takes Waldrop at her word and reads 
          Bayer in an attempt to understand why it prompted a change in her fundamental 
          method of composition, one can begin to suspect whether this particular 
          collage text ultimately differs enough from its antecedents for its 
          form alone to explain its potent appeal. Other, earlier texts could 
          also have served Waldrop as synecdoches for the ongoing Dada and Surrealist 
          tradition of juxtaposing found materials — for instance, Max Ernst’s 
          <i>La femme 100 têtes</i> and <i>Une semaine de bonté</i>. Well known 
          for her expertise regarding avant-garde French and German literature, 
          she presumably had an array of comparable examples from which to choose.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Der Kopf</i>, I believe, helped catalyze an 
          artistic breakthrough because of its compelling fusion of content — 
          repeated voyages of discovery into the unknown — and form — a serial 
          juxtaposition of prose by different writers. Bayer’s narrative, like 
          Waldrop’s earlier <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s Daughter</i>, is a variant 
          on the old tradition of the quest narrative, and again like <i>The Hanky</i>, 
          the itinerary that the work traces requires that it enter unexplored 
          country. There is one crucial difference, however. Bayer’s text does 
          not mire itself in compulsive authorial self-reflexivity. Agency is 
          distributed among a cohort of writers. Any truths to be found, fostered, 
          or created are a joint, even a communal responsibility.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Decentering “authorship” in this manner is not, 
          of course, the same thing as excluding the personal altogether. Waldrop 
          knew that collage by itself could not prevent autobiographical content 
          from finding its way into <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. The novel’s 
          prospective theme — the “enormous migration from Europe to America, 
          wave after wave of explorers, conquerors, immigrants” — was too intimately 
          related to her own experience of moving from Germany to the United States, 
          a “change of world” that “surfaces again and again” in her writing (“Between” 
          xv). In addition, she had already learned that, although collage involves 
          recycling others’ words and hence nominally absolves the writer of “authoring” 
          them, self-expression nonetheless stubbornly reinserts itself in the 
          very acts of selecting and arranging one’s found materials:</p>

      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>I had used collage before . . . . I had turned to 
          collage as a way of getting away from writing about my mother. I would 
          take one or two words from every page of a novel, say. The poems were 
          still about my mother. This taught me that one does not need to worry 
          about contents: our preoccupations will get into our writing no matter 
          what. (xvi).<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For Waldrop, then, <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> 
          would not have held out the promise of a straightforward, ecstatic release 
          from either subjectivity or the burden of the past. She would not have 
          been drawn to it because it advertised impossible escapes into the unconscious, 
          surreality, or other, higher, egoless states of consciousness. Rather, 
          she seems to have chosen Bayer’s narrative because it implicitly extols 
          the power of heteroglossia to reframe an author’s contributions as only 
          one aspect of an ongoing, collaborative, intertextual excursion. A casting 
          of the net, a forging of a network of relations.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [10] </span></a> This paradigm for understanding writing as fundamentally 
          intersubjective, processual, and investigative is evident in her comments 
          regarding the indispensability of collage in her writing since <i>A

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In short, <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering </i>provided 
          Waldrop with a set of premises regarding language, craft, and literature 
          that permitted her to sublime both the “betweenness” of her dual nationality 
          and the troublesome generic hybridity of her first novel into a potent, 
          persuasive compositional methodology: “An art of separation and fusion, 
          of displacement and connection. For without our connecting them into 
          a picture the dots are not even visible. An art of betweens” (xvii).

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Although in the finished text it appears as the 
          second section of <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>,<i> </i>“A Form 
          of Memory” was in fact the first part to be written, and in it the influence 
          of Konrad Bayer’s <i>Der Kopf des Vitus Bering</i> is at its height 
          (xv-xvi). Most obviously, “A Form of Memory” echoes <i>Der Kopf</i> 
          in its layout, short blocks of prose grouped under such fanciful rubrics 
          as “A Physical Description of Sexual Intercourse,” “Illustration,” “Eyewitness 
          Report,” and “Elegy.” Again as in <i>Der Kopf</i>, its passages all 
          read as if they have been excerpted from disparate other texts. A list 
          of sources that appears at the book’s back confirms this impression, 
          and, like Bayer’s appendix, it seems to be both reliable and comprehensive. 
          Bayer’s precedent permits Waldrop to make drastic alterations in the 
          affect and the style of her prose. In contrast to <i>The Hanky of Pippin’s 
          Daughter </i>— recounted by a mischievously biased narrator in a nominally 
          epistolary format — “A Form of Memory” aspires to a thorough-going impersonality 
          in its manner of construction and presentation. Nowhere in “A Form of 
          Memory” does Waldrop speak <i>propria persona</i>. Assembly-line fashion, 
          we are delivered what can initially appear to be no more than raw boluses 
          of fact, definition, and observation.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Whereas Bayer mitigated the abruptness of this 
          plunge into unadorned collage by providing a preface to explain his 
          methodology and intent, Waldrop opts for another, albeit comparably 
          pedagogical, means of easing a reader into the welter. The opening section 
          of “A Form of Memory, titled “Physical Description of Motion,” self-consciously 
          and gradually establishes the pattern for the remainder of the chapter. 
          Its first four prose blocks serve as a concise introduction to the sorts 
          of materials its readers will be encountering as well as suggesting 
          the kinds of reading skills that they will require in response. Additionally, 
          Waldrop evokes, only then to repudiate, a possible American precedent 
          for her embarkation on a career as a <i>collagiste</i>:</p>

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first paragraph’s catalog foreshadows the radically 
          paratactic construction of “A Form of Memory” as a whole. It also alerts 
          readers that are responsible for inferring what connections if any exist 
          among its oddly juxtaposed passages of text. The last item in this catalog, 
          the “botanist,” is a calculated non sequitur, insofar as he is a living 
          being and everything else in the catalog is a non-animate scientific 
          instrument. Waldrop hints broadly that von Humboldt looks upon his traveling 
          companion as just another tool, to be employed dispassionately in the 
          process of scientific inquiry. But she <i>does </i>only hint at it. 
          A reader must take that leap him- or herself.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Odd, paratactic juxtapositions that invite inferential 
          interpretation: at this point, an experienced reader of twentieth-century 
          American literature might reasonably conclude that Waldrop has tacitly 
          declared her allegiance to the tradition of Ezra Pound’s <i>Cantos</i>, 
          which are built throughout on precisely this basis. The next paragraph, 
          the one beginning “Before him,” appears to confirm this intuition. It 
          unexpectedly switches location and dramatis personae, though it retains 
          the same general subject, a maritime journey to the New World. Hugh 
          Kenner, writing about the <i>Cantos</i>, has called this kind of associative 
          leap a “subject rhyme,” that is, a juxtaposition of disparate historical 
          personages that is also an assertion of family resemblance.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [12] </span></a> We are almost certainly supposed to read von Humboldt 
          as a latter-day avatar of Columbus — just as in the <i>Cantos </i>we 
          are to read Eleanor of Aquitaine as a medieval beauty who parallels 
          Helen of Troy, or Mussolini as a munificent patron akin to the Renaissance 
          <i>condottiere</i> Sigismundo Malatesta.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The third and fourth paragraphs of “A Form of Memory” 
          accelerate the vertiginous transitions to new scenes and topics. First, 
          we are given an italicized passage about a cheerful-yet-threatening 
          “mistress” with a “switch,” presumably a teacher of some kind. Then 
          we are supplied with what sounds like a quotation from a textbook on 
          prosodics distinguishing the technical meanings of “stress” and “accent.” 
          These abrupt changes in discursive register again recall Pound’s <i>Cantos</i>, 
          more specifically its ideogrammic method, in which fragmentary verse 
          and found texts are strung together to create cumulative statements 
          about an implied subject matter. The four paragraphs here serve as a 
          Poundian ideogram for “discipline”: scientists, like teachers, arrange 
          and order the world and language, a process that overtly or covertly 
          involves force. Waldrop is reiterating a theme that we have already 
          seen, namely that the European encounter with the New World, even in 
          its outwardly benign guise of the search to discover new knowledge, 
          involves the impulse to “discipline” its unruly otherness.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">So far there is little to distinguish Waldrop’s 
          Bayer-derived compositional method from the paratactic mode of Pound 
          and his progeny. “A Form of Memory” initially seems to position itself 
          as yet another masterful example of post-World War II, post-<i>Cantos 
          </i>prose in the tradition of Charles Olson’s <i>Call Me Ishmael </i>and 
          Susan Howe’s <i>My Emily Dickinson</i>. Waldrop’s first measurable swerve 
          from the Poundian variant of collage occurs in paragraph nine of “Physical 
          Description of Motion”:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>Alexander von Humboldt knew that Columbus’s inspiration 
          “from the heart” had been a flock of parrots flying toward the southwest, 
          a word with level stress where the accent falls with equal emphasis 
          on both syllables. Birds, said Alexander von Humboldt. All land his 
          discovered by birds. He lifted his field glasses, but could see nothing 
          but an expanse of water apparently boundless. (185)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">While remaining within the thematic orbit of the 
          opening paragraphs, this passage does not display the same internal 
          integrity. Yes, “southwest” can be scanned as indicated, but it is extremely 
          difficult to imagine a source text that would interject this piece of 
          information in the midst of reporting von Humboldt’s ruminations on 
          his predecessor. Waldrop has intrusively treated one kind of text — 
          presumably the biography of von Humboldt by Douglas Botting that appears 
          in the “List of Sources” at the book’s back (248) — as an occasion to 
          illustrate the definitions of “stress” and “accent” earlier introduced. 
          While the <i>Cantos</i> do selectively edit, (mis)translate, reconfigure, 
          and otherwise alter their source texts, the deadpan wit here is foreign 
          to the tone of Pound’s epic, which aggressively pursues the <i>directio 
          voluntatis</i>, the thrust of his will, through eons of historical and 
          archaeological evidence.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [13] </span></a> Nor does Waldrop’s impersonal intervention dovetail 
          well with the prophetic posturing common in the prose collages of such 
          Poundian heirs as Olson and Howe. Her cheery digressiveness serves not 
          to overawe a reader with superior, transcendental insight into the timeless 
          order of things but instead to distance him or her, however briefly, 
          from the “discipline” ideogram and to provoke her or him to attend to 
          the limits and assumptions that inform any given act of writing. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">By eschewing the authority of the archivist, Waldrop 
          aligns herself with Bayer, who dismisses any claim that “A mosaic of 
          facts” can “be treated as irrefutable knowledge [<i>gewissheiten</i>].” 
          One must adopt a skeptical attitude, he explains, toward “so-called 
          historical fact [<i>tatsachen</i>]” in the name of “what cannot be proved 
          [<i>überprüfen</i>],” namely, “the sum of possibilities.” He selected 
          Vitus Bering’s story, recorded in scattered and biased records, for 
          his departure point not because he wishes to resurrect a wronged, neglected 
          hero (such as Pound’s Malatesta or Howe’s Anne Hutchinson) but “because 
          [Vitus’s story] leaves things sufficiently open, because it is unclear, 
          because it is contradictory, because one can falsify (or correct) it 
          without losing the historical backdrop” (<i>Der Kopf </i>168). Falsifying, 
          correcting, contradicting, prizing open, obfuscating — these are boldly 
          interventionist activities, hardly evincing the documentary fidelity 
          to the historical record that is the (ostensible) guiding principle 
          of such Poundian, collage-based works as Olson’s <i>Maximus Poems</i>, 
          Howe’s <i>Birth-mark</i>, William Carlos Williams’s <i>Paterson</i>, 
          and Charles Reznikoff’s <i>Testimony</i>. Waldrop, like Bayer, makes 
          the discourses of history subject to open, crass, and ludic manipulation 
          so as to free her readers from their aura of immediate, privileged access 
          to historical truth. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop, in fact, goes a step further than Bayer 
          in this regard. His rhetoric remains transcendentalist in one crucial 
          respect. While evincing scorn for an archival art, his critical attitude 
          toward “so-called historical fact” nonetheless coexists with longing 
          for mystical revelation, an entrance into a temporality in which “past 
          and future . . . are bound into a single point” (168). As far back as 
          1971, in her study <i>Against Language?</i>, Waldrop had registered 
          her distaste for all traces of vatic self-presentation in mid-twentieth-century 
          European avant-garde art — a category to which Bayer unmistakably belongs. 
          In <i>Against Language?</i>, she had argued that the solution is for 
          a writer to redirect a reader’s attention from airy flights of speculation 
          to the nuts and bolts of language’s functioning (122-23).<i> </i>We 
          find this same tactic at work more than a decade later. Waldrop comments 
          that “I flatter myself that [in “A Form of Memory”] I pushed the juxtaposition 
          of heterogeneous materials farther than [Bayer] had, even into the sentence” 
          (“Between” xvi). That last qualification — “even into the sentence” 
          — is no mere throwaway line. Bayer exposes the contingency of the discursive 
          production of history, but he also leaves open the possibility of banishing 
          history altogether as false artifice in order to inhabit a messianic 
          Now. Waldrop, by pushing her inquiry into history further, by operating 
          at the sentence level and below, focuses more narrowly on the <i>language</i> 
          of history. She begins to speculate less about what transcends the historical 
          record than about the rules of selection (semantics) and combination 
          (syntax) by which that record is assembled. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The third grouping in “A Form of Memory,” titled 
          “Physical Description of Motion, Continued,” contains an early, illustrative 
          instance of the splicing internal to a sentence that would soon come 
          to distinguish her variant of collage. First, there appears a statement 
          that reads as if were lifted from an introductory medical textbook: 
          “The action of a muscle is to contract, or to shorten in length, and 
          thus the two structures to which it is attached are brought closer together.” 
          Four prose blocks later occurs a drastically reworked version of the 
          statement: “Metaphor implies a relationship between two terms which 
          are thus brought together in the muscle” (186). Waldrop has hybridized 
          the diction of two disciplines, literary criticism and gross anatomy. 
          She implies that they are comparable, perhaps equally invasive forms 
          of knowledge. Obviously, this connection again relates to the overarching 
          theme “to know = to master.” It also likely accounts for the recurrent 
          interest in ballet in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, since dance, 
          as an emphatically embodied art, serves as an analogue for fiction writing, 
          both of them for Waldrop <i>aesthetic </i>modalities of disciplining 
          flesh (of bodies, of language) that stand as alternatives to the more 
          instrumentalized languages of the academy (medicine, poetics).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">First producing a Pound-like collage-quotation, 
          and then soon afterwards misquoting it, Waldrop provides readers with 
          an object lesson in how collage will operate in her works. She informs 
          them that they will encounter skewed, ill-sutured, and whimsical reinscriptions 
          of other writings. A statement such as “A vast twilight zone, nearly 
          1500 miles wide, was slipping around the earth as the latter turned 
          on its axis” — which first appears in a section titled “Eyewitness Report” 
          in “A Form of Memory” — is liable to reappear without notice in another 
          permutation, whether it be simply paraphrased (“The vast twilight zone 
          slips around the earth as the latter turns on its axis” [226]) or radically 
          reworked in a spliced sentence (“A later meaning of elegy was a poem 
          in whatever meter in which a twilight zone slips around the globe” [190]). 
          These later near-repetitions, in turn, destabilize our confidence in 
          the original statement. Can we trust that Waldrop has indeed lifted 
          it intact from a source in the bibliography, such as von Humboldt’s 
          <i>Kosmos</i> or David Todd’s <i>Professor Todd’s New Astronomy</i>? 
          The Poundian promise of direct treatment of the thing gives way to a 
          discomfiting, Derrida-like display that all citation is always already 
          potentially miscitation.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One need not, though, jump to Derrida or poststructuralism 
          more generally to help us understand Waldrop’s take on collage. Such 
          a rhetorical move would falsely suggest that there is something uniquely 
          “postmodern” about it. Instead, we can return to the technique’s ur-scene, 
          the <i>avant guerre </i>years when Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso 
          first elevated <i>papier collé </i>from a kitschy popular art into a 
          cutting-edge avant-garde strategy for Making It New. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Poundian collage is akin to the newsprint that 
          Picasso frequently pasted to his canvases during Cubism’s founding “analytic” 
          phase. Both Pound’s and Picasso’s incorporations of borrowed text purport 
          to offer a direct, indexical relationship between the artwork and the 
          social world from which these materials have been drawn. The finished 
          poem partakes in the ephemeral and the social with un-literary bluntness. 
          Any attempts to praise it as a hermetic or autonomous text founder on 
          its unlovely incorporation of mundane, often journalistic writing. As 
          Peter Bürger would put it, such collage furthers the avant-garde project 
          of breaking down the baleful distinction between art and “life praxis” 
          that prevails in late capitalism.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [14] </span></a> </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop’s version of collage — linked, via Bayer, 
          with a non-Poundian, Continental descent line — also recalls Cubist 
          collage, albeit in a very different manner. It aspires to emulate the 
          <i>whole</i> of a Cubist painting. In the years 1912-13, Picasso typically 
          included not only found materials (chair caning, wallpaper, etc.) but 
          also painted patches, stenciled letters, <i>trompe l’oeil</i> wood grain, 
          and other traces of the artist’s hand. In works such as<b> </b><i>Violon 
          et partition</i>, <i>Tête d'homme au chapeau</i>, and <i>Bouteille et 
          verre sur un guéridon</i>,<i> </i>Picasso seeks not simply to undermine 
          aesthetic autonomy but to issue a radical challenge to a complacent 
          viewer’s presumptions about how painting signifies. He quite literally 
          deconstructs his art, employing shading that does not indicate depth, 
          lines that do not suggest edges, superimposition that does not convey 
          protension, and so forth, as Rosalind Krauss has richly detailed.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          </span><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>[15] </span></a> The mixture 
          of found objects, <i>faux</i> found objects (wood grain), and free painterly 
          expression functions within this more general semiotic project of reeducating 
          the eye to perceive the conventionality of illusionism, that is, the 
          “painting = window” metaphor fundamental to the art since the Renaissance. 
          Similarly, in “A Form of Memory” Waldrop suggests that her borrowings 
          have nothing naïve about them. She promises to manipulate, violate, 
          cross-cut, and otherwise render their unspoken assumptions overt. Pound’s 
          collage is evidentiary. Waldrop’s is forensic.<span lang=EN-AU

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After completing “A Form of Memory,” Waldrop proceeded 
          to write the three other sections that make up the remainder of <i>A 
          Form / of Taking / It All</i>. Throughout, she chose to employ as a 
          structural scaffolding a technique internal to “A Form of Memory”: the 
          appearance of quotations that recur in partially or drastically revised 
          forms. She made two changes, however. First, the prose passages in “A 
          Form of Memory” serve as her primary source for this game of repetition 
          and variation. Second, by positioning “A Form of Memory” as Part II, 
          she insures that a reader first encounters these source texts in Part 
          I (“A Form of Vertigo”) in their occulted, spliced forms. As a consequence, 
          Part I is full of unpredictable, fanciful moments that at first refuse 
          easy assimilation into plausible explanatory frames, causal chains, 
          or dramatic scenarios. Much of the narrative’s appeal lies in this uneven, 
          surreal surface. For example, in “Vertigo,” in the midst of a stream-of-consciousness 
          passage, one encounters,</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>A fork in the road. Henry. What a disaster if they 
          had married. Curing stingray bites by having a prostitute urinate into 
          the wound. It leads to a particularly virulent form of syphilis. Does 
          forgetting count as forgiveness or just being forty, holding her face 
          up to the sun? (162)<span

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The thoughts about Henry, marriage, turning forty, 
          and making choices (“fork in the road”) fit the immediate context. Amy 
          Lowell is vacationing in Mexico and musing about the course that her 
          life has taken. The stingrays, prostitutes and syphilis though — these 
          are vivid, intrusive subjects that are less easy to square with the 
          setting and point of view. Is Lowell reaching for a suitable metaphor 
          for the imagined “disaster” wedding? Does she feel prostituted? Diseased? 
          These grotesque metaphors — if they are indeed <i>are</i> metaphors 
          — leave a reader guessing at possible constructions that would accommodate 
          their jolting interruption of the story’s course.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Forty pages later, “A Form of Memory” provides 
          a short passage offering a possible yet oddly tardy answer to the conundrum: 
        </p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>To cure injuries caused by the sting-ray, you must 
          find a woman willing to strip and urinate into the wound. For the sake 
          of completeness it must be stated that, as there are hardly any women 
          here except peasant prostitutes, this cure more often than not leads 
          to a particularly virulent kind of syphilis. (207)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here we are presented with the bemused, condescending 
          tone of a travel writer presenting, and debunking, a folk remedy for 
          the audience back home.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference> 
          [16] </span></a> Perhaps, in the earlier stream of consciousness passage, 
          we witness Lowell’s fleeting, condensed memory of what she had read 
          in this same travel book. Her thoughts about Mexico, as she lies in 
          bed with the shades down, arbitrarily commingle “original” thoughts 
          with words and images that have been lifted from her reading. One is 
          not free of other authors’ voices even in the privacy of one’s skull.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i> gradually takes 
          on the air of a fun house, in which passages recur unexpectedly in new, 
          often distorted guises. Sometimes the changes of context and content 
          provide ambiguously supplementary information, as it does with the stingray 
          cure. Other times the repetition-with-variation estranges the material 
          more drastically. The two narrative sections — Part I, recounted from 
          Lowell’s perspective, and Part III, written first-person from a novelist's 
          viewpoint as she struggles to round off the tale of von Humboldt and 
          Lowell — are pocked with these odd moments. Ada, Lowell’s love interest, 
          is forever being described in stilted, inappropriate terms that “A Form 
          of Memory” makes one suspect have been purloined from Aggrippina Vaganova’s 
          <i>Basic Principles of Ballet</i>. John, Ada’s son, spouts awkward statements 
          about Beethoven and Montezuma that reappear verbatim in Part II. Astronomical 
          and poetological passages from Part II reoccur in the novelist’s stories 
          about Washington, DC. In each of these cases, verisimilitude suffers 
          badly. Would any real person ever spontaneously repeat the bland, fact-choked 
          language of a textbook with such uncanny fidelity?</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Even the most vivid, seeming-profound moments of 
          Waldrop’s story are susceptible to demystification. At the end of Part 
          I, Lowell has a dreamlike vision of herself struggling, physically acrobatically 
          contorting, to escape the burdens and embarrassments of childhood:</p>

          behind. This is why she must learn to walk on her hands. Two older girls 
          take hold of her legs. Her hair is hanging down to the floor, her skirt 
          falls over her belt down over her neck. Thus, legs high in the air, 
          she walks across the stone floor, a moving island surfacing from the 
          music that has spread all over the ground. Again and again, till the 
          teachers turn away: “Her thighs are too fat,” she hears, “and she already 
          has pubic hair.” (180)<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A couple of these details will recur prominently 
          in Part II — the parrots (185) and the thundering (193) — but the bare 
          essentials will reappear in a single narrative outtake, again likely 
          derived from Vaganova’s <i>Basic Principles of Ballet</i>:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>In my new class I was made to walk on my hands. Two

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The first iteration of this incident conveys the 
          intense shame involved in the process of publicly disciplining a vulnerable 
          body. One sympathizes acutely, viscerally with Lowell’s discomfort in 
          her own skin. When, however, one comes across another version of the 
          same story twenty pages later, the anecdote ceases to be Lowell’s unique 
          “property.” Now an extract from a textbook, it loses what had been a 
          florid, revelatory particularity. Also, the scene with Lowell had established 
          a set of expectations — about her psychology, biography, place in society 
          — that are thrown into doubt when the same words (“Two older girls,” 
          “hair . . . down to the floor,” “legs high in the air”) pop up again 
          to describe a different-yet-similar action, another girl walking on 
          her hands. We are forced to go back and attend to the specific words 
          and turns of phrase that had given rise to our first, powerful impressions; 
          we thus look anew at the earlier passage with an eye less to its content 
          than to the details of its composition. Recurrence in <i>A Form / of 
          Taking / It All</i> undermines a reader’s faith that fictions, window-like, 
          grants us transparent access to other worlds. We discover repeatedly 
          that a given “window” is in fact a carefully constructed tableaux of 
          words susceptible to artful rearrangement and re-presentation. Collage 
          decisively enters Waldrop’s <i>oeuvre</i> in a work dedicated to rigorously 
          exposing the troubling power relations that inform every act of communication, 
          even (or especially) the act of creating literature.<span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, Waldrop 
          made rapid advances in use of collage. In her hands, the technique has 
          become increasingly supple and expressive, especially as she has gained 
          more confidence in manipulating her found material. At her best, Waldrop 
          is able to keep a reader deliciously off balance, unsure what is original, 
          what borrowed. Incongruity alone is no guarantee that one has encountered 
          a seam between discourses. Indeed, one of her goals in a book such as 
          <i>Reproduction of Profiles</i> is to expose the gaps and slippages 
          <i>within</i> the language of her source texts (in that case, Wittgenstein’s 
          <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>). Although she has had frequent 
          recourse to the metaphor of the palimpsest to describe this vertigo-inducing 
          writerly surface (e.g. “Between” (xvii) and “Form and Discontent” (61)), 
          a better analogy might be a word processor file that consists of cuts, 
          pastes, deletions, and rearrangements of text originating elsewhere. 
          Unlike a palimpsest, such a file would contain no optical indication 
          of depth that would enable an easy sorting out of past and present, 
          original and copy. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A sample of Waldrop’s more recent use of collage 
          can usefully conclude this article by demonstrating the continuities 
          (and discontinuities) in her practice as she moved from writing novels 
          back to her principle vocation, writing verse. I have chosen “Shorter 
          American Memory of Salem,” a piece brief enough to examine in its entirety 
          that also evinces important thematic connections to <i>A Form / of Taking 
          / It All</i>, namely the ugly, murderous power politics involved in 
          the European colonization of North America.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>Shorter American Memory</i> (1988), in which 
          “Shorter American Memory of Salem” appears, is a collection of twenty 
          two pieces that, as Waldrop explains on the obverse of the title page, 
          “are derived from sources collected in Henry Beston’s <i>American Memory</i> 
          (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1937).” Beston’s <i>American Memory</i> 
          turns out to be an anthology of diary entries, letters, court transcripts, 
          official pronouncements, and other historical documents intended to 
          offer a reader “a mirror of the stirring and picturesque past of Americans 
          and the American Nation,” as the title page puts it. In the book’s preface, 
          Beston states the none-too-covert nationalist thesis informing the anthology’s 
          implicit narrative:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>From its beginning, American has been writing about 
          itself, and writing well. Indeed, it is not in the literary imitation 
          of European models that American literature has its deepest roots but 
          in the vigorous narrative prose of the native-born generation who left 
          us their seventeenth century accounts of Indian captivity . . . [Using] 
          immediate experience still sharp with emotion wherever I found it, I 
          have put together this memory of the adventure of the Republic, now 
          as then in the making. (xix)<span
lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In other words, <i>American Memory</i> celebrates 
          “native-born” Americans who are neither Native Americans nor Europeans. 
          It retells their exciting “adventure” in “vigorous prose” so that we, 
          their patriotic descendents, can relish their “memory.” Intent on establishing 
          (white) American identity as the product of racial and national conflict, 
          <i>American Memory</i> devotes the bulk of its attention to subjects 
          such as the colonization of the Eastern seaboard, war with Indian tribes, 
          war with Britain, and the development of a self-sufficient indigenous 
          culture and economy.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In short, the “memory” enshrined in Beston is archival 
          but also highly selective, adjusting the historical record to serve 
          as a record of the trials, tribulations, and victories of a Chosen People. 
          It is also a resolutely middlebrow version of a Poundian “poem including 
          history,” an epic whose protagonists are multiple and whose significant 
          episodes are related by means of juxtaposed extracts from original documents. 
          Beston serves Waldrop as an occasion to renew the historiographical 
          critique so vigorously asserted in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. 
          Her abridgement and radical revision of <i>American Memory </i>uses 
          collage to expose the violence — wreaked on people <i>and</i> history 
          — when nationalist-prophets dictate how documents and facts are ordered 
          within an official, shared narrative. When a plurality of memories become 
          one <i>American Memory</i>.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">“Shorter American Memory of Salem” corresponds 
          to chapter four of <i>American Memory</i>, titled “Geneva and New England,” 
          which offers a selection of documents illustrative of Puritan religiosity. 
          She boils its fourteen pages down to a scant seventeen lines that serve 
          as a quiet but moving meditation on women’s place in colonial American 
          society: </p>

      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Waldrop here concentrates her attention on the 
          first four documents in “Geneva and New England,” all of which have 
          been taken either from Cotton Mather’s <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i> 
          or from Salem’s surviving seventeenth-century court and civic records. 
          She borrows most heavily from a paragraph by Mather (I have put the 
          relevant phrases in bold and indicated where in the poem they occur):</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div class=Section1>In June 1682, Mary the wife of Antonio Hortado, dwelling 
          near the Salmon-Falls, heard a voice at the door of her house, calling, 
          “What do you here?” and about an hour after had <b>a blow on her eye</b> 
          [14], that almost spoiled her. Two or three days after, <b>a great stone</b> 
          [1] was thrown along the house; which the people going to take up, was 
          <b>unaccountably gone</b> [2]. A frying pan then <b>in the chimney</b> 
          [6] rang so loud, that the people at an hundred rods distance heard 
          it; and the said Mary with her husband, going over the river in a canoe, 
          they saw the head of a man, and, about three foot off, <b>the tail of</b> 
          [4] a cat, swimming before the canoe, but <b>no body to join them</b> 
          [5] and the same apparition again followed the canoe when they returned: 
          but at their landing it first disappeared. A stone thrown by an invisible 
          hand after this, <b>caused a swelling and a soreness</b> [3] in her 
          head; and <b>she was</b> [7] bitten on both arms black and blue, and 
          <b>her breast </b>[10] <b>scratched </b>[7]<b> </b>the impression of

lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></div>
      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>, “Shorter 
          American Memory of Salem” freely alters the order and character of the 
          phrases lifted from its source texts. Waldrop changes “caused a swelling 
          and a soreness” to “caused soreness and swelling”; she omits a run of 
          ten words to produce “she was scratched”; and she decides to associate 
          “the teeth” and “her breast,” despite the fact that, as we see in the 
          original, “she was bitten” not on her breast but “on both arms.” Furthermore, 
          in “Shorter American Memory of Salem” she changes the sequence in which 
          the phrases appear. She may preserve a trace of that ordering — observable 
          in the run [1], [2], [6], [4], [5], [3], [7] in which only two elements, 
          [6] and [3], are out of place — but the first phrase chosen from this 
          paragraph ends up in the next-to-last line of the poem. Again we see 
          that Waldrop’s form of collage is unapologetically interventionist and 
          revisionist.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The most dramatic alteration occurs at the level 
          of historical referent. There is no legible trace of Mary, Antonio Hortado, 
          or Cotton Mather in Waldrop’s poem — none of the impedimenta of citation, 
          marginal annotation, and bibliographic description that litter Pound’s 
          <i>Cantos </i>and buttress Beston’s authority. She treats all her sources 
          for this lyric just as cavalierly. Despite the fact that they span several 
          decades and describe many events, including the discovery of sunken 
          Spanish treasure, she distills from them a continuous commentary on 
          a single historical episode, the infamous Salem witch trials of 1692. 
          She insures that the poem will be read in that light by offering us 
          no other proper name than “Salem” itself, a town indelibly associated 
          in American popular culture with the likes of the dastardly Justice 
          Hathorne, the unjustly accused John Proctor, the slave fortune teller 
          Tituba, and the “afflicted” teenagers Mary Warren and Abigail Williams. 
          In her oblique retelling, however, Waldrop offers not Arthur Miller-style 
          realism but an impressionistic, vaguely Gothic (“mysterious,” “apparitions”) 
          catalog of observations. She culls from Beston phrases that evoke, even 
          invoke, a specter that his inclusion of “The Penitence of the Jurors 
          of Salem” cannot lay fully to rest: the American proclivity to use civic 
          and religious zeal as pretexts for killing innocent men and women.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem’s opening lines introduce the paradoxical 
          imbrication of absence and presence that dominate the piece. The “great 
          stone” in the first line suggests the heavy stones famously used to 
          crush to death Giles Corey, an accused witch who refused to enter a 
          plea. The “great stone” also hints at the weightiness, the imponderability, 
          of the witch trials for subsequent generations of Americans. The poem’s 
          second line — “where unaccountably gone” — suddenly reverses the first 
          line’s assertion of presence, a fact emphasized by the slant rhyme “stone” 
          / “gone.” Has the stone vanished before it could be “counted,” that 
          is, weighed and measured? Or does Waldrop call our attention to “Salem” 
          as a location which combines or juxtaposes the all-too-present (the 
          stone) and the irrevocably lost (that which is “gone”)? The remainder 
          of the poem restates but does not resolve this tension. Suggestions 
          of absence or erasure (“no damage,” “no body,” “no cattle”) jostle with 
          vivid statements about all-too-present, injured female flesh (“a blow 
          to her eye,” “she was scratched,” “teeth on her breast”).</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">One could read this dynamic as an oblique commentary 
          on the events surrounding the witch trials: the young girls who based 
          their accusations of witchcraft on mysterious blows from ghostly assailants, 
          the blameless women and men executed for nonexistent injuries to others, 
          the witches’ familiars presumed but never seen, etc. One could also 
          read into the poem a subterranean narrative of domestic abuse. A woman 
          is repeatedly harmed without that harm ever being publicly acknowledged 
          or the perpetrator called to account. She knows her pain intimately 
          (“knowing her own”) but “pious considerations” — whether hers, her abuser’s, 
          or the community’s — prevent that pain from ever becoming fully real, 
          in the sense that it would then become a problem demanding response 
          or recognition from others. In “Shorter American Memory of Salem,” by 
          selectively excerpting, rearranging, and revising the language used 
          by seventeenth century Puritans to talk about their world and their 
          experiences, Waldrop dramatizes the vulnerability, the violence, and 
          the fear that run just beneath its surface. Moreover, she intimates 
          that the “pious considerations” that they espouse not merely oppress 
          but <i>damage</i> women crushed beneath their “great stone.” The anaphora 
          here (“where . . . where . . . where”) distantly but appropriately echoes 
          the use of another interrogative, “who,” as the backbone for the first 
          part of Allen Ginsberg’s <i>Howl </i>(“I have seen the best minds of 
          my generation . . . who . . . who . . . who”). Like Ginsberg, Waldrop 
          laments the wastefulness of history, bringing suffering and loss to 
          the very people a just or civilized society would liberate and celebrate.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This message is not new. We saw Waldrop making 
          much the same point in <i>A Form / of Taking / It All</i>. But in the 
          few years between that work and <i>Shorter American Memory</i> Waldrop 
          has learned to employ collage with much greater craft. She has ceased 
          to rely upon repetition and variation as a principle of construction. 
          The phrases that appear in “Shorter American Memory of Salem” appear 
          nowhere else in <i>Shorter American Memory</i>. The abrupt jolts and 
          transitions in <i>A Form </i>that lend it the feel of Surrealist <i>cadavre 
          exquis</i> have been replaced by a surface that is simultaneously smoother 
          <i>and</i> more disorienting, insofar as one cannot guess where Waldrop’s 
          contributions end and the found texts in their rawness begin. “Shorter 
          American Memory of Salem” also absorbs, abridges and revises Beston’s 
          anthology with an assurance that permits a greater latitude of tone 
          than <i>A Form</i>. Finally, <i>Shorter American Memory</i> eschews 
          any traces of Poundian parataxis. In place of that giddy form of artifice 
          — dependent on sharp edges and bold transitions, hence a technique well-suited 
          to delivering punchlines and epiphanies — she embraces collage within 
          hypotaxis (“where . . . where . . . where”), an art of relationality 
          that explores nuances of subordination and insubordination, both grammatical 
          and political. <span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt;

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In 1912 Picasso bequeathed to the avant-garde a 
          mode of collage designed to defeat illusionism in painting. At the turn 
          of the twenty-first century Waldrop provides us with a version capable 
          of exposing a different illusionism, the false authority arrogated when 
          prophets have recourse to “history” to justify their visionary dreams. 
          Again, not a new message. It is one we have heard often in the last 
          hundred years. But the last hundred years have also taught that some 
          messages bear repeating. Waldrop has crafted a form adequate to this 
          content. </p>

          its last six pages do concentrate almost exclusively on <i>A Form /

          Amy Lowell (371-72); the novel’s thematics of exploration, conquest, 
          and sexual dominion (372-73); and the anomalous, versified fourth section

          Waldrop recalls that her initial intent in placing “A Form of Memory” 
          second was to set it up as “a fever vision” that Amy Lowell endures 
          while “sick in Mexico.” In other words, Waldrop sought to “normalize” 
          the collage welter of Part II by framing it with Part I’s “interior 
          monologue” (Retallack 375). The particular echo-effect that I detail 
          here may be a trace of this plan. In the book’s final published form, 
          though, the lack, of any transition between Parts I and II, as well 
          as drastic shift in style between them, render it highly unlikely that 
          a reader will consistently read “A Form of Memory” as akin to a medieval 
          dream vision. As I now proceed to explain, the interplay between the 
          first two sections is less stable, more variable, in short, designedly 
          disorienting. </span></p>
