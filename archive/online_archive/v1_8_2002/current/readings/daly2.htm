          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lola Ridge’s first book was published when she 
            was 41; she emigrated to the United States from Australia as a divorced 
            woman, and routinely cut as much as ten years off her age. She lived 
            in the U.S. for over a decade before a major publisher released her 
            volume, <i>The Ghetto And Other Poems</i>. What did Ridge do earlier 
            in life? What kind of influences did she experience? When did she 
            begin to write? </p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Leaving her first husband and New Zealand, Ridge 
            traveled to Sydney, Australia, where she began art studies with Julian 
            Ashton, a painter and forebear of the Julian Ashton who would ultimately 
            rename his school the Julian Ashton School. She is said to have supported 
            herself as an artist’s model and illustrator. About this time, she 
            must have begun writing poems under the nickname “Lola.” She completed 
            a 93-page manuscript which she gave to Alfred George Stephens, a prominent 
            editor and promoter of Australian literature who ran “The Red Page” 
            of the popular newspaper, <i>The Bulletin</i>.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> [2]</a> Under the aegis of <i>The Bulletin</i>, he also 
            published poetry collections and is known for publishing the first 
            volumes of many fine Australian poets.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [3]</a> Among the books Stephens published were three by 
            bush poet and lyric poet John Shaw Neilson, the poet who wrote the 
            manuscript stored at the Mitchell Library with Lola Ridge’s <i>Verses</i>.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [4]</a> A.G. Stephens’ 
            papers are in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. 
            While the poems in Ridge’s manuscript may have been published in Australian 
            journals, newspapers, or in chapbook form, I have found none. Ridge 
            left Australia for San Francisco in 1907, two or three years after 
            the completion of this manuscript.</span></span></span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The poems in 
            <i>Verses</i> are long verses, poems written using iambic pentameter 
            arrayed in a survey of stanza lengths and rhyme schemes. One reason 
            the apprentice prosody in this manuscript is important to read is 
            that the first three books Ridge published in New York (starting some 
            fifteen years after she wrote <i>Verses</i>) are mostly free verse. 
            With the sonnets in <i>Red Flag</i>, her third book, she returned 
            to rhyme and meter. She followed that book with a book-length poem, 
            <i>Firehead</i>, and a sonnet sequence in <i>Dance of Fire</i>, her 
            last book. Ridge’s return to traditional form was partly a response 
            to Arthur Kreymborg, who encouraged a generation of politically active 
            poets to write miserable ballads and sappy sonnets. It was also a 
            return to her poetical roots. </span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">There is a 
            loose category of Australian poetry which is not very familiar to 
            me, but seems necessary to consider when thinking about <i>Verses</i>, 
            that of bush poetry. Bush poetry is not like American cowboy poetry, 
            although some contemporary bush poetry is like contemporary American 
            cowboy poetry, with its humor, doggerel, and slang. Bush poetry readership 
            and poets are obviously not only people with a particular job description 
            or people in a particular region; bush poetry might be usefully, if 
            problematically, termed working class pastoral. It is limited to people 
            who write about a particular ecology and economy. Bush poetry might 
            be compared to western American poetry from the 1880s into the 1930s 
            which focussed on the deserts, grasslands, and prairies. That earnest 
            Lola Ridge, writing in Sydney, born in Dublin, raised in the gold 
            fields of New Zealand, would be writing something that participates 
            in the tradition of bush poetry is a little surprising. She carried 
            many of the traditions of bush poetry to a New Zealand landscape, 
            which is to say, out of the bush, by mentioning Lake Kanieri, New 
            Zealand, and Tuhua, a volcanic island off the coast of New Zealand. 
            Like John Shaw Neilson, Ridge writes a lyric bush poetry. It is perhaps 
            significant that her manuscript should be housed with John Shaw Neilson, 
            who brought to bush poetry some of the first influences of modernism. 
            </span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Another little 
            surprise awaiting the reader of <i>Verses</i> is the way in which 
            the poetry, and older bush poetry, compares and contrasts to the feminized 
            genteel poetry written in America at this time. Genteel poetry largely 
            addresses or approaches a set of subjects which include death, particularly 
            the death of children, aspects of family religious belief under female 
            control, and female domestic culture as opposed to domestic work. 
            Some of the best genteel poetry of the American West is Helen Hunt 
            Jackson’s writing on plants. Some of the best older bush poetry also 
            realistically depicts nature, forming a natural symbolism. Ridge feminizes 
            the bush as she struggles to find a female lyric voice.</span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The first section 
            of <i>Verses</i>, entitled “Voices of the Bush,” begins with the mood-setting 
            “Under-Song.” In 1918, she would include a heavily revised version 
            of this poem in her first book, <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems</i>. 
            The original ending couplet, “The meaning of the song / He faintly 
            hears,” contains the only gendered pronoun in the early draft of the 
            poem, indicating that the reader and interpreter of the bush’s song 
            is male, while the singer of the song, described in the opening couplet, 
            “The mystical, the strong / Deep throated Bush” is the author, Ridge. 
            The second poem in the early manuscript, “At Sun-Down,” begins, “The 
            bush is leaning like a tired child, / Her dear head nestling on the 
            breast of night,” indicating that all parts of nature are female. 
            The bush remains female in the rest of the poems. In the overtly erotic 
            “The Bush,” Ridge begins, “The gay winds fondle with the maiden Bush”: 
            the winds and day are male, but everything earth-bound remains female. 
            While this may seem to be obvious mythography, it is neither a bush 
            poetry or genteel poetry commonplace. Additionally, Ridge was a divorced 
            “New Woman” artist and writer, neither the active wife of a miner 
            nor a mother at home. She would go on, in New York, to be active in 
            such feminist projects as Margaret Sanger’s <i>Birth Control Review</i>. 
            She would also continue to feminize the earth and sea, and maintain 
            the maleness of the wind.</span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">The second 
            section of <i>Verses</i>, entitled “Songs of the Sluicers,” is based 
            on Ridge’s experiences in the gold fields of New Zealand. Later in 
            her career, she will drop the rhyme in her longer poems. Description 
            such as, “the red light from the lant’rns / Lit the faces round the 
            shaft,” will remain. The dialog will go, but Ridge will remain interested 
            in telling slang, unfortunate dialect, and their evil twin, poeticized 
            or heightened language. Toward the end of <i>Verses</i> there are 
            poems which are like bush poetry, humorous rhyming doggerel in slang, 
            but set in the gold fields, not in the bush: “Helblatavesky’s Cow,” 
            which references Madame Blavatsky in its final reference to a golden 
            calf, contains silly puns and slang. Mining, the causes of miners, 
            and marked descriptions of mining equipment and metals continues throughout 
            Ridge’s work. Her half realist-half lyric description of miners and 
            mining begins in <i>Verses. </i>Writing about gold mining allows Ridge 
            to combine her search for real and emotionally moving political actions 
            with her lyricism of light. The labor union organizations and strikes 
            Ridge experienced when first coming to America were miners’ unions 
            and coal and copper mining strikes. Her later writing about mining 
            allows her to write from memory as well as prophetically.</span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">An additional 
            aspect of this unpublished text is that it contains two versions of 
            two poems, “The Flame Flower” and “Song of the Earth [Spirit].” The 
            text is consecutively numbered, including the revisions, but there 
            are markings in the text which indicate them, such as “see page 44.” 
            These revisions are “signed” in typescript “Lola Ridge,” and after 
            the last of them, the second draft of “Song of the Earth,” entitled 
            “Song of the Earth Sprit,” is the note, “I revised these pieces last 
            night &amp; as they seem to sound better am sending you the copy.” 
            The revisions are not major. For example, “The Flame Flower” is in 
            a male voice. A line is revised, “Well men are lust driven fools.” 
            to “We men are desire driven fools!”</span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">Many of the 
            poems toward the revisions and the center of the manuscript, either 
            in the right margin, at the end, or in a stanza break towards the 
            bottom of the page, bear the annotations “Royal 42th / ‘H.M. Greville,’” 
            “Super Royal 52th / ‘H.M. Greville,’” or “Imperial 78th / ‘H.M. Greville.’” 
            These seem to be addresses of British Army units stationed in Sydney 
            harbor. For example, the Royal 42th is The Black Watch of Scottish 
            Highlanders. I don’t know Ridge’s relationship to the H.M. Greville, 
            and cannot find a record of a ship with that name. British army units 
            at that time did act as gold escorts.</span></p>
          <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><i>Verses</i> 
            by Lola Ridge remains a hard-to-find text which will not enter the 
            public domain in the U.S. until 2011, and will not enter the public 
            domain in Australia until Australian copyright laws change. Yet the 
            poems and annotations reveal a great deal about Ridge’s development 
            as a poet, her travels and living situation, and early reception history. 
            She was a poet of considerable dedication, writing a long manuscript 
            using a variety of stanza forms and poetic techniques. These poems 
            are not occasional verse or a mere sampler, but represent an attempt 
            to feminize and even eroticize nature in poetry, to bring the situations 
            she experienced in the gold fields of New Zealand to Australia, and 
            to write in a female voice as well as a male voice. The poems show 
            her attacking the problems of writing poems as a heterosexual woman, 
            such as the problems of voice when describing nature as a woman in 
            lyric and in narrative poetry. She was a poet of sufficient stature 
            in Australia that she was able to submit an entire volume of poems 
            to the leading poetry editor of the time and place.</span></p>
