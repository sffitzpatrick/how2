  basic problem is simple: there are too many one-to-one matchings, and so too 
  many ways that at least <br>
  one of a pair will be missing.One of the pair can be lost in one of several 
  places: If you have to telephone<br>
  a) when you take them off and drop them on the floor someone while you are traveling 
  and need to pass<br>
  b) when you move things around on the floor on personal financial information 
  to the person you are<br>
  c) when you scoop them up and drop them in the laundry enclosuer calling don't 
  do it at an open telephone<br>
  d) in the laundry room booth where passersby can listen in on what you are saying 
  use a telephone booth<br>
  e) in the washer where you can close the door and<br>
  f) in the dryer wait until you are at a less public location to adopt a need-to-know 
  approach although many people need to know mother's maiden name for security 
  verification. There may be adopted several methods to find the other half such 
  as advertisement prayer sentimentality and others may not need to know details 
  such as eye colour colour weight height distinguishing marks clothes first middle 
  last name alias hobbies friends if any</font></strong></p>
