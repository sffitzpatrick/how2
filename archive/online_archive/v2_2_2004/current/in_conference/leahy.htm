<P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">Mark Leahy </P>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>1</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This paper was originally
presented as a Talk in the series organised by Robert Hampson at Birkbeck University.
There was a reflexive element to the presentation, as the Talk referred to its
own form, and drew attention to the shape of the evening. I have retained these
comments in this revised version as they are relevant to the argument such as
it stands. The stage directions or performance notes were read as well as
performed in the presentation. They reference poems of Darragh’s that also
describe their own procedure.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p><b>Step One:</b> <i>Enter space; place small suitcase
    on table.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The title of this talk ‘performing
the familiar sentence’ comes from an original intention to focus only on Tina
Darragh’s poem ‘Raymond Chandler’s Sentence’; the work of hers that Ron
Silliman included in his anthology <i>In the American Tree</i>. I afterwards
moved to include comments on other work of Darragh’s.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Step Two:</b> <i>Open suitcase.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This talk will unpack each of the
terms in its title, more or less thoroughly. It will at times make literal the
metaphors contained in them, as this unpacking literalises a dead metaphor. On
the other hand, a scaling phenomenon is often spontaneously analyzed by the
mind into a hierarchy… Therefore one must not hasten to follow Descartes’
recommendation and begin to subdivide every difficulty into parts. (Mandelbrot,
<i>Fractal Geometry)</i></p>



<blockquote>
  <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Step Three:</b> <i>Remove doughnut from suitcase.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The form of the talk concerned me
slightly, as I was unsure how to pitch it. I felt it should be less formal than
a lecture or a paper, and at the same time, it needed to be more structured
than a 40-minute session of ad libbing. The shape of the event would differ
from a lecture, as my contribution should provide material that would invite a
response from those others present. Unlike the lecture with its obvious
hierarchy, with its central figure of one speaker, this talk might be more
decentred, centreless, like a doughnut maybe.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>I attempt to see whether we can experience ourselves
    as … capable of functioning as fractured parts of a greater, albeit
    oddly-shaped whole. (<i>Moving Borders</i>, 700)</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
  <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Step Four:</b> <i>Remove strip of paper from case,
    and make a mobius strip.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps the mobius strip is a better model, as it also
removes a sense of a hierarchy by having one edge, having one surface. In its
circling back on itself, its returning to the beginning (or absence of
beginning) this model implies speaker and audience, speakers and audiences, in
a reciprocal relationship, with movement in different directions. This model
also removes any pressure I might have felt to come to a conclusion, or to make
particular points in a given order.</p>


<blockquote>
  <p>The mobius strip is part of the “writing as carving”<br>tradition. First, the rectangle is held
    steady at<br>
    one end and given a sudden half twist at
the other.<br>
    The ends then are taped or glued
together resulting in<br>
    a one-sided figure where before there
were two. This<br>
    180 degree turn is much like the suffix “mo” which &#8211;<br>
    after numerals or their names &#8211; indicates the number<br>
    of leaves made by folding a sheet of
paper. (<i>on the corner</i>, 25)</p>
  <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Step Five:</b> <i>Take sheets of text from case.
  Close lid and put to one side.</i></p>
  
</blockquote>
<p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>2</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This talk began to be put together in Somerset in August 1999 on the day of the solar eclipse. I was house-sitting for friends and so happened to be in the band of 95-97% coverage. I had taken several of Tina Darragh’s books with me, as I wanted to get some uninterrupted work done on a dissertation chapter that studied her work. This talk will demonstrate features of Darragh’s work, of her working, and of my engagement with these processes and their outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>                                  The progression to
        this point<br>
        is first academic, then technical. Textbooks give way<br>
        to textiles which lead to T-formations and T-groups. (<i>on
the corner</i>, 7)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The form of the ‘talk’, the ‘talk as genre’, can offer
scope for a ‘personal voice’, a speaker ‘talking’ as opposed to the objective
commentator of the conventional academic paper. This speaker talking may
develop a narrative, with a central character, a character designated as ‘I’.
‘I’ appears throughout Darragh’s work, and for ‘you’, the audience, for the
listeners to the ‘talk’, as I incorporate portions of Darragh’s writing into
this talk, the distinction between the two ‘I’s, (if they are always two, if
they are not aspects of each other differentiated by context), will not always
be easily heard. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was diagnosed as having
    eyes which don’t work together — “wide divergence at near and far.” Eye
    exercises produced no visible difference. (‘Scale Sliding’, 37)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Mark Leahy is not proposing to speak
for Tina Darragh, he does though appropriate some of her lines and re-performs
them without always signalling their source. I follow her lead in letting an
‘I’ into the text, an ‘I’ that is at once ‘familiar’, that you recognise and
attribute, but that is at the same time problematic, and is performed as a
role, as a character. That ‘I’ which might be thought to gather to itself the
characteristics of an individual, the experiences of a familiar person, becomes
a character, a character in the performance, an inscribed stroke, a keystroke,
a letter, unindividuated without (its) context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-right:31.1pt;text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
          became convinced that I was a physiological distorter &amp; that I had<br> 
          to find
        a way to set myself straight. (‘Scale Sliding’, 37)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">‘I’ serves as one signal of the
performance, and in the performance that is Darragh’s writing, the ‘I’ links
works and projects. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>          as puns go<br>
      I’m not playing fair<br>
      piecing my words together<br>
      with a point<br>
      much as I adjust<br>
      the fragments I see (‘Scale Sliding’, 38)</p>
  <p>Some have gotten around this problem by building
  models &#8211;<br>
  ambiguous figures —which purposely distort lines so we
  can<br>
  view “what we do” to see.  (‘Scale Sliding’, 39)</p>
  <p>but by breaking the lines<br>
    I realize<br>
    I’m not the one<br>
    who causes words<br>
    to lie apart<br>
— they come that way &#8211;  (‘Scale Sliding’, 49)</p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>3</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In ‘Procedure’, Darragh’s commentary
on her work, written for <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> magazine, she describes the
performance of the works in <i>on the corner  to  off the corner</i>, as they
come about on the pages of the dictionary, using finger movements, tracing
lines, transcribing results, leaving tracks, traces. The reader follows these
tracks, follows the trace of the movement of making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>                                  Wrist action
    proceeded from<br>
    there — wrist-lock, wrist-pin, wrist-shot, wrist
    wrestle,<br>
    wristy — preparing us “motor-wise” to write: to write
    our<br>
    own ticket, write-down and write-in. (<i>on the corner</i>,
    5)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Several of the poems in <i>on the
corner</i> hold together as paragraphs, with the sentences within them
describing a journey, functioning as a recipe, or a manual for making such
poems. The paragraph relates a narrative of its own construction, using syntax
to link part to part, clause to clause, sentence to sentence, in a record of
the temporal sequence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>                                                                      Then,<br>
      with a little push, “plug” and “stuff” find themselves<br>
      to be classical yet vulgar kin moving warily toward<br>
      herbs having large, silky aments. (<i>on the corner</i>,
    21)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This part to part relationship, is at
times akin to assembly instructions, or a lesson plan. In ‘“long” increased
simultaneously with “fine”’, from <i>a(gain)<sup>2</sup>st the odds</i>, a
Montessori teaching exercise is included, presented step by step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>by putting one foot<br>
      in front of the other<br>
      I expect myself<br>
      to make each step<br>
      a mirror allot               (<i>a(gain)<sup>2</sup>st
    the odds</i>, [18])</p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In ‘adv. fans — the 1968 series’, the
steps of the writing procedure are described, and then the results are
demonstrated. In
the introductory section of adv. fans
Darragh writes how she was thinking of the possibility of a poem in the form of
a theatre (28).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">At the time, I was trying to figure out if
    a poem could be in the form of a theatre with words/sounds in every seat. The
    image in my mind was a Hannah Weiner performance in DC in the early ‘80s in which voices arose from the audience in conjunction with Hannah
    reading alone on stage. I wanted to “build” a poem based on my memory of that reading, avoiding both the “naturalization” and stigmatization of multiple,
    overlapping voices. (28)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A poem as a theatre
involves the blurring of genres, and at the same time the adoption of generic
forms or conventions not usually associated with theatre. Speech or voices
usually located only on the stage and directed from the stage would now also be
found coming from the seats. The theatre form is not just
concerned with performance, though this is important, it concerns the
relationship between stage and seats, the reader/performer and the audience.
Darragh maps the form of the “advertisement fans” onto the shape of the theatre.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fan’s
    folds were the rows of seats; the voice, center-stage, a hand opening and
    closing. (28)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Theatre and advertising
both draw public language into the space of the poem. The language of political
speeches, of the church, of power, is seen to be included in everyday private
language or the personal. The poem considers the development of particular
language terms over time, the introduction of new words and uses into the
language, and the pressures on language that bring about these changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “adv.
    fan” steps are:<br>
    1) Photocopy pages from one or more
    dictionaries (using different ones can help the transcriptions).<br>
    2) Randomly tear one dictionary page and
    then paste it over a whole one.<br>
    3) Fold into a fan and read.<br>
    4) Transcribe a section and place between
    two definitions attributed to having first been said in 1968. (<i>Out of
    Everywhere</i>, 28)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The procedure for the
composition of the fan sequence is given in numbered points. Any reader could
follow these “steps”, and a wide variety of different
results might be produced. This procedure combines the intimate and the remote,
the familiar and the strange. The tearing and pasting and folding of pages
involves the writer’s/maker’s hand, as did the composition of the poems in <i>on
the corner,</i> the writer’s hand or the reader’s hand in close contact, in intimate touch. The framing of this intimate
investigation with “definitions”, brings in public classification of
language, and the ordering of language based on ‘objective’ observation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>shot line  —  1968, A.P. Bolder.   <i>Compl.
    Man Skin Diving</i>. xiii 248.<br>
    A shot line … should be used from a boat when diving in bad visibility. (‘adv. fans’, 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The intimate presence of
the writer’s or reader’s hand does not imbue the made text
with the aura of the individually crafted work, it is not concerned with the
transference of the value of the individual maker to the unique, original
object. Rather, the procedure invites equivalent intimate gestures from other
reader-makers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>teletransport  —  1968, <i>Punch</i>, 2
    Oct. 488/1.<br>
    A Royal Martian Vole … teletransported
    herself to your planet in 1964. (‘adv. fans’, 33)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The inclusion of the generalised,
commodified gestures of language in a public sphere, does not exclude the
personal, but draws the remote or alien(ating) into a space where the
individual can negotiate (with) it.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>4</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Part of Darragh’s work ‘adv. fans — the 1968 series’ is included in the anthology<i> Out of Everywhere</i>, edited by Maggie O’Sullivan. The anthology is subtitled,
“linguistically innovative poetry by women in North America and the UK”. One catalyst for my consideration of the term ‘familiar’ in relation to Darragh’s work, is O’Sullivan’s ‘To the Reader’, her preface to this anthology. In this introduction O’Sullivan uses some terms I have been pointing towards in my discussion of Darragh’s work, though the emphases she makes in reading this work differ from mine. O’Sullivan writes:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Each poet featured here […] does not <i>represent</i>
    a familiar world and therefore cannot be read in familiar ways. Consequently,
    many of them, through brave insistence and engagement in explorative, formally
    progressive language practices, find themselves excluded from conventional,
    explicitly generically committed or thematic anthologies of women’s poetry. […] Rather than perpetuating prevalent notions of writing
    poems “about”
    something, the poets here, to my mind, have each in their own imaginative way
    committed themselves to excavating <i>language</i> in all its multiple voices
    and tongues, known and unknown. (9-10, emphasis in original)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">O’Sullivan is engaged, here, in a polemical differentiation of the writers within her anthology from other writers not included there, in an inverse of the exclusion she claims her selected writers are subject to. Darragh, in her work, uses those factors or categories of writing that organise the ‘other’ sort of anthology of women’s poetry, in particular genre, and the familiar. Her use of these features does not disqualify her from inclusion in an anthology of “linguistically innovative” writing, but it is not marked in O’Sullivan’s comments. The image of “excavating language”, on the other hand, is especially relevant to the works in Darragh’s <i>on the corner  to  off the corner</i>, as well as in ‘adv. fans …’.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The use of excavation as a
model here, recalls Susan Sontag’s use of it in the essay ‘Against Interpretation’ (6). In ‘Against
Interpretation’, Sontag reviews the
history of interpretation and hermeneutics. Then, describing the situation of
the discipline at the time of her writing, she observes that it “excavates”, and as it excavates it destroys the
work in its drive to dig behind the text, to find a sub-text that is the true
work (6). The concept of ‘excavation’ as
used by O’Sullivan, functions as a more positive engagement with the materials
of reading and writing. For Sontag, an otherwise unproblematic emphasis on
content lessens the work of art. She writes:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Interpretation, based on the highly dubious
    theory that a work of art is composed of items of content, violates art. It
    makes art into an article for use, for arrangement into a mental scheme of
    categories. (‘Against Interpretation’, 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The result of the
interpretive drive, for Sontag, is to make of the work of art something
consumable, a product, a meaning that can be admired, exchanged, valued. It
could be subject to taxonomy, classifiable according to its content. Labelled
in this way it will be taken out of active service, made timeless, made into an
object outside history. Sontag stresses the need to historicise the activity of
interpretation itself, to be aware of it as a social or cultural construct, or,
to construct an historical methodology of interpretation (7-8). For Sontag,
excavation is associated with an interpretative drive that would reduce the
work of art to “an
article for use” (10).
Excavation, as Sontag reads it, will shut down options, while in O’Sullivan’s terms it can open up possibilities.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The image of excavation
has been used more than once in relation to Darragh’s work. Both Hank Lazer and
Michael Davidson quote a commonplace from Emerson’s essay ‘The Poet’. The
quotation, “language is fossil poetry”, draws on a sense of writing involved in
a digging out of older senses of words, of refreshing dead metaphors, of
uncovering the hidden at the heart of language. Davidson uses the quotation
specifically in relation to what he terms “lexical archaeology” (<i>Ghostlier
Demarcations</i>, 106), and gives a family tree of twentieth century
practitioners who work in/with this feature, leading back to Pound’s work in
the Cantos. Lazer uses it in relation to Darragh’s “dictionary derived
compositions” (<i>Opposing Poetries</i>, 45). Both these instances consider
that the poetry is engaged in revealing something already there, or in bringing
to light aspects of language not easily perceived. By using the scientific
model of archaeology to comment on the work, they propose a model where options
for reading or writing are closed down, as in archaeological practice finds are
classified, layers are recorded, and the past is made known. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Darragh’s engagement with
the page of the dictionary does not suggest she readily accepts the historical
model, the scientifically etymological narrative of the words on the page. In
place of the proposed biography of words offered by a dictionary, a model based
on Romantic humanist notions of development, a <i>bildungsroman</i> for each word,
Darragh proposes a contextually specific engagement with the material of
language. She quotes Art Berman: “New Criticism, grounded in empiricism,
attempts to account for the formulation in literature of a non-scientific
cognition which is an imposition of Romantic notions upon a purportedly
scientific procedure”. Darragh goes on:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>This is the problem that I’ve
    taken to heart. In my projects, I’ve turned this process around, imposing
    purportedly scientific procedures on Romantic notions, in an attempt to
    challenge this tradition. (‘fractals «-» I-in-error’, 32)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:39.65pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>5</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The various work collected
in <i>Out of Everywhere</i> is unfamiliar, is outside or opposed to generic
classification, is opposed to an easy classification of the work of women
writers. Darragh reassesses the familiar, and recuperates some of the features
of (women’s) writing that O’Sullivan dismisses. In considering the term
‘familiar’, I sense its unpopularity; within ‘innovative writing’ circles it is
too easily a term of censure. In its place, I would like to suggest ‘intimate’.
A sense of ‘intimacy’ or ‘the intimate’ would describe close engagement with
the material of poetry, as writer and/or as reader. This is the proximity of
pen and hand, keyboard and hand, hand and page, screen and eye, eye and text,
the text and I. The specific context of reader/writer in engagement with the
words in/of writing, that intimate contact, exists in tension with the
repetition of that engagement by others or in other times and places. The
particular event is in tension with recurrence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so I twist myself around<br>  
      of my mother chain reading<br>
      mysteries while lying on the couch<br>
      her afternoon “nap” always<br>
      our way of finding her<br>
      when we’d
    come home from school  (‘Raymond Chandler’s Sentence’, 392-393)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Darragh’s image in ‘Raymond Chandler’s
Sentence’, of her mother chain reading mysteries on 1950s schoolday afternoons,
is part of a chain of reading, of readings. Darragh reads Chandler and other
mysteries in the present of the poem, Chandler had been a reader of Earl
Stanley Gardner, and I now read Darragh’s poem. The chain stretches into the
past and future, intertwining with other texts along the way. This familial
reading, this reading in community, does not have to mean the works will be “read in familiar ways” as O’Sullivan puts it (O’Sullivan, 9). Reading as a social
act, rather than solely as a private individual act, offers possibilities of
engaging closely with these writings without reducing their unfamiliarity. The
writer is not with the reader as a mother might be, and so instruction, a
teaching is built into the texts. The texts carry their own pedagogy. The
writing carries tools for operating it, operating on it; it demonstrates its
own functioning. Darragh’s work, in particular, carries such apparatus, as it describes its
making. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Removing a parallelogram from a similar
    parallelogram<br>
    (by taking one of the corners) results in a
    shadow seen<br>
    as a cylinder by squinting.  (<i>on the
    corner</i>, 28)</p>
</blockquote>
 <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Darragh’s fingers moving over the pages of her dictionary, in the writing of <i>on the corner</i>, were physically intimate. Her pinning of one of Raymond Chandler’s sentences above her desk meant that she was in intimate contact with it over a period, she became familiar with it, in close contact with it, she read it closely. Such ‘close reading’ need not only be that of scientific observation, but also the closeness of an intimate relationship. This intimate reading, is a response to texts that are initially unfamiliar, it depends on the reader becoming familiar with the text, so that she can recognise something of what is going on in her reading. There is a danger that this model of intimacy sounds isolated, a private interaction between writer or reader and text. The relationship cannot take place without a context, the writing exists in context, and the reader becomes intimate with it in context. Her negotiation of the text will be facilitated by a range of other readers in the past and present, and the reader will be part of this network of relationships, thus being involved in a social intimacy.</p>

      I realize I needed to create this order<br>

</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps Darragh in reading
detective novels repeats a reading act of her father’s (and of her mother’s) and so “goes to him”, or links up with him in a familial
reading. Hardboiled detective novels are sometimes seen as ‘men’s’ books more than as women’s, and this may link father and
daughter. The fact that Darragh connects to her father through a genre points
to the enduring popularity or wide distribution of detective fiction, and
comments on an essential feature of genre, that it involves repetition or
recurrence. “[A]s recurrent patterns of
language use, genres help constitute the substance of our cultural life” writes Carolyn Miller (‘Genre as Social Action’, 39). The repeated reading act,
recurring over generations, itself can be considered as a genre, and this genre
of action functions to culturally link the lives of Darragh and her father. The
father, in a different way to the mother, can provide a model of reading, is a
model reader. The detective novels are here held out as a possible link, a
bridge to the other generation, the other gender, a connection to the father. </p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Genre as a means of
classifying works allows for their being assigned to families. To this extent,
it depends on the familiar. The notion of a family connection among works can
also be applied to writing not considered generically linked. Ron Silliman in
his commentary on the mini-anthology ‘The Dwelling Place’ published in <i>Alcheringa</i>, calls it a “fix-in-time of writing which bears a
family resemblance” (118).
“Dwelling” is linked to belonging, and to home,
and thus to the familiar. As Freud in ‘The Uncanny’ points out, the familiar
carries with it, its apparent inverse, the uncanny or unfamiliar (220-222). The
reader recognises the familiar, it is in some sense already known. She can also
recognise the unfamiliar, in the distinguishing mark of anagnorisis (the
rhetorical figure of recognition), or in an aberrant occurrence of the known.
The “family resemblance” may offer a familiar place of engagement
with new work, or a variety of unfamiliar works may be grouped by their
difference from the known. Works that are assigned to the same genre may be
considered as borrowing from one another, or perhaps, as each borrowing from
some common source or model. Genre is thus linked to translation and to
re-working, and might be considered a social manifestation of the intimate
collaboration of a writer with a text. </p>

    picture of things I’d never seen before from an archeological dig, neatly
    arranged as an advertisement. I panicked but then I thought, “Well, the

    things by the wrong names?” I pointed to each item in turn and said “SHOVEL  URN 
    TREE  POT  BRICK  BOAT”.  (‘Dream Rim Instructions’, 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In his book <i>Recognitions</i>,
Terence Cave emphasises the presence of recurrence, of repetition within
situations of recognition. There is a “compulsive returning to the ‘same’ place” (489), a return to the familiar.
Within this compulsion is carried that other aspect of the familiar, of the
recurring, that of the uncanny. The return to the familiar is not always easy,
and there are uneasy aspects to the performance of generic action. In Darragh’s engagement with Chandler’s <i>The
Big Sleep</i>, and its translation into film, there is something she “hadn’t expected”, in spite of her familiarity with
the story, and with the genre. This “further confuses” her, and leaves her with the feeling she is “facing something [she] can’t see” (‘RC’sS’, 393-394). Her response is
to work her way out of this, by repeating actions, repeating exercises from
high school Latin class, (re)creating an order that has been disrupted
(‘RC’sS’, 394-395). She then realises that she “needed to create this order” so that she could repeat a series of
generic actions, so that she could return to a familiar situation through
negotiating a generic form (395). The performance of a genre serves to
establish familiar bonds, and at the same time it is in (re)forming familiar
bonds that generic action takes place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so it’s there that I decide to abandon<br>
      the project &amp; leave Chandler’s sentences<br>
      with him &amp; as a parting shot<br>
      look up “abandon”<br>
      as a way to set off<br>
&amp; following it back far enough<br>
      I find it comes from<br>
“to place”    under    “speak”  (‘RC’sS’, 396)</p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>6</b></p>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The talk as a generic form is a performance; and as Bob
Perelman puts it:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>the form of the talk contains possibilities that are not
    explored elsewhere by the ranges of language-writing practice — specifically
    dramatic and rhetorical effects that depend on narrative and an unambiguous
    notion of person, and thus seem to go against the grain of much of that
    practice.  (‘Speech Effects’, 201)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I first typed out this quote, for the written text
of this talk, I was going to leave out the reference to language-writing
practice in particular, and so focus on the form of the talk outside a specific
literary historical context. I then thought of the fact that Darragh in
discussing her own relationship to that practice has referred specifically to
narrative and notions of the person as causing her writerly embarrassment, as
causing a friction between her work and that of language-writing as defined by
certain practitioners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need a narrative structure to be part of my writing,
    but I have to identify that need as “embarrassing” (i.e.: “something wrong”, an
“error condition”) to even begin discussing it.  (‘Error Message’, 703)</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In an interview with Tina
Darragh, published in <i>Aerial</i> 5, Joan Retallack speaks of Darragh’s work as “negotiat[ing …] two extremes”, one of “expression” and the other of “formal kinds of approaches” (69). For Retallack, this means that
Darragh has “personal reasons for why
[she] chose the procedure” (69). I agree that Darragh does join the personal and the procedural,
but what is particular about her joining of them is not that she has “personal reasons” for doing so, but that she often
presents these reasons in the work. These reasons guide the shape or the action
of the procedure. This raises the distinction between the personal and the
private in writing. For me, the private depends on a sense of an isolated
individual claiming ownership of her work, while the personal relates to a
situated person engaged in socially intimate actions.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Later in their
conversation, the two writers associate this personal <i>and</i> procedural
mode of making poetry with questions of gender. For Darragh, the matter of
procedure, of formal approaches, can map very easily onto the working life of a
woman and mother, where there is “this constant negotiation with all these different variables” (76). The writers agree that this is
“about gender” as there is still a different
concern among many male writers.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p><b>T</b>: […] I think I am still sort of angry about it — but
    I think it has to be said — in terms of writing there’s
    still very much a product orientation in this “language” community. You know, “are you just playing with this or are you
    serious about what you are doing?” — as though playfulness and seriousness don’t go hand in hand. (77)</p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What angers Darragh is
that while writers can happily blur the boundaries between genres, between
styles of work, there are limits to this blurring, and these writers feel a
border is needed to delimit serious work from mere play. Darragh’s joining of the intimate and the
public, and of the familiar and strange in both, can strain at those borders.
For other writers in the community, the sense of a Language-writing community
may depend on the maintenance of boundaries just as much as any other style or
form does. If the work is threatened from without by the perception that it is
not “serious”, the presence within the community
of “suspiciously playful” work (77), can further undermine how
the work of the community is viewed by others. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This talk has attempted to
play with aspects of the talk form, with elements of Darragh’s work, in order
to enlarge the possibilities for writing, and for discussing writing. The talk
as a form, as defined by Bob Perelman, would seem to offer a space for those
elements of writing that Darragh feels embarrassed by, for those aspects of her
practice that she feels are not always welcomed by other practitioners. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align:justify">In
    supplementing the monologic voice of poetry, the talks opened a precarious
    space between dominant voices and democracy, auratic performance and group
    participation. (‘Speech Effects’, 215)</p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">On that note I opened the
space of the Talk to participation by the others present.</p>
