<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This paper traces my engagement with the writings of women mystics in mediaeval Europe, which resulted in a series of poems.  I want to stress that this is not an explanation or justification of
the poetry, and also that I am by no means an expert in mediaeval writing.  It was written simultaneously with the poetry, perhaps in sympathy with Jack Spicer’s admonition: “We will use up our rhetoric here so that it will not appear in the poems.  Let it be consumed, paragraph by paragraph, day by day, until nothing of it is left in our poetry and nothing of our poetry is left in
it.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>  So the relationship between
what I say here and what the poetry turned out to be, apart from their common
points of departure, is uncertain; they are perhaps entirely parallel
investigations driven by the same interest.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’ve called it <i>Specula</i>,
mirrors, a common mediaeval trope for the book, because I found reading these
mystic writings generated all sorts of reflections on my own and other
contemporary writings.  My dialogue with the texts has been primarily as a
poet: this means an opportunistic, argumentative, cannibalistic and
disrespectful relationship, organised only by unpredictable structures of
responsiveness and preserving jealously a certain irresponsibility which is
totally at odds with scholarly study. Despite this, my interest led me to some
cogitations which may masquerade as scholarly: and that’s as far as my apologia
for this essay goes.  Here I aim to explore why these writings attract me, to
briefly sketch their context and nature, and also to reflect briefly on a
couple of aspects of contemporary poetics which this essay into the Middle Ages
have highlighted for me.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To read mediaeval texts in
Europe, where everywhere are old stones bearing the mark of human habitation
stretching back thousands of years, is one experience: there one is aware of
the gap of time, but also of concrete continuities.  To read them in Australia,
where European history goes back only slightly more than 200 years, and where
most of the buildings that surround you are much less than a century old, is
another.  It makes reading a uniquely linguistic experience: the writing is
unsupported by the architectures of inhabited landscape, the landscape which
has been shaped by European language and which has shaped it.  I look out my
window, I walk through the suburbs, and nothing in my environment supports
these historical experiences: I see no ruins, no churches below the level of
the contemporary street, no sense of “old stones” beneath the bright commercial
surfaces.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Like its landscape, Australian
history is vast, stretching back 140 millennia, and becomes mythological: myth
being the stories we inscribe across the blankness of geographical time.  This
span of time yawns behind our tiny European history, just as the inner deserts
dwarf our urban habitation.  It’s not unlike how the shadows in an enormous
theatre in which only tiny patches of human activity are lit can create an
enormous poignancy, a physical sense of the mortality and insignificance of
human beings.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A few years ago I paid a brief
visit to Lake Mungo, which is near where the borders of Victoria, South
Australia and NSW meet.  Here it is red earth Australia, an entirely different
landscape to the somewhat Europeanised one I’m used to in Victoria: the
vegetation is aqua, a result I think of the salt content of the soil, and the
leaves have different, strangely primitive shapes.  Lake Mungo itself is
strictly speaking a plain: it was an actual lake 30,000 years ago.  What is
left is miles of level red earth, sprinkled with the low blue fuzz of saltbush
and bounded by high white sand dunes which once marked the shores.  There is a
constant, punishing wind which bruises your skin and continually shuffles the
dunes.  Lake Mungo has now turned into a tourist attraction; there are the
outbuildings of a now deserted sheep property, and a small modern museum which
houses some of the fossils of now extinct species which have been found there,
like the giant marsupial wombat, and Aboriginal relics.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">What struck me with particular
piquancy were the 30,000 year old camp sites which have left their traces in
the sand dunes.  Buried in the sands are the remains of ancient meals: shells
from molluscs which were gathered from the vanished lake, bones of cooked animals,
the blackened earth of a fire extinguished millennia ago.  The wind, in its
constant movement of the dunes, continually brings these traces to the surface:
usually all too briefly, since such exposure signals the beginning of their
ultimate obliteration.  You can stand over these ghostly campfires and watch
the process of the wind eroding them, the sand blasting away at the shells and
bones and blackened earth, until no sign at all remains.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lake Mungo is one of those
places where European language falters.  You can describe the sense of
horizonless space and time beyond a human scale, the overpowering feeling of
human insignificance, mortality and poignant persistence, but really you are
left with a palpable sense of the inadequacy of words.  It throws up a
challenge to the limits of language, and so suggests the edges of mysticism. 
In Aboriginal languages and systems of meaning, this is a landscape of
presence, harsh perhaps, but speaking of vitality and life, impregnated with
myths of creation which are ongoing, a primordial time which exists within, not
before, the present.  But a European mentality ends up describing everything in
terms of absence and negativity: to a European eye, this landscape has an
indescribably desolate beauty, the kind of godlessness which to some minds
invites an image of God, a drastic alienness which shocks the self out of its
comfortable linguistic associations.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This sense of dislocation
extends to my relationship to the English language, as I am a first generation
migrant from England.  That dislocating shock of alienated language is part of
my primary experience and has had a profound affect on how I write poetry. 
Perhaps this partly explains my attraction to the mystical texts.  I discovered
a surprising contemporaneity in these 700 year old writings, in their
displacements of self and contradictorily empowering strategies of speaking, in
their assertion of interiority as a public act.  Without projecting an
imaginary feminism onto them, it seems to me that the writings of mystic women
can be seen as visualisations of possibility rather than, as has been often
said, simply expressions of “hysteria” or sexual lack, or the self indulgent
expressions of the frustrated egos of women.  The fantasies of the female
mystics could go so far as to reshape an obdurate reality to more rightly fit
their desires, however temporarily, and functioned as expressions of freedom in
a world in which women’s voices were “stifled, imprisoned by an ethic that
treated sins of the tongue as gluttony and as harbingers of worse, of lust and
pride.”  In such a society, “women who presumed to speak out publicly only
compounded the sin” of speaking at all.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> 
They remain potent traces of a successful struggle by the silenced against
silence.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Historically, Western woman
has been, by definition, not a literary being, a maker of original texts: at
best she was a helpmeet to male fertility; at worst, she simply didn’t exist. 
To confidently assert the right to speak against this historical weight can be
mentally taxing, even now; in the Middle Ages, when the legal rights of women
were minimal, and their right to speak in public barely extant, it is
surprising they managed to speak in this way at all.  Yet there are dozens of
texts in which women articulate their desire to speak, from educated
aristocratic women like Christine de Pisan to the often anonymous hagiographies
of Beguine nuns and the estimated one per cent of female troubadours.  The
creative ways in which women have attacked and subverted the prescription of
silence are manifold and have been traced in many ways by many people, and it’s
not my intention, nor within my ability, to do more than look at a very small
part of what is an enormous subject.  Specifically, I want to look at the
energising freedom to be found in the extremities of the female mystics, a
throwing off of linguistic constraints in the midst of the very act of bowing
to conventions.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Here I simply intend to make a
couple of very sketchy general observations of the institutionalised cultural
misogyny in the West, and its venerable history.  In Christian society, the
myth of Eve is a dominant symbol in the representation of women and their
relation to language.  Eve, Dante said in <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>, was the
institutor of language; she was, after Satan, the first to use language to
seduce and mislead, and her tongue was the originator of her sin and of
humankind’s misfortunes.  In Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Eve addresses the
fruit of the Tree of Knowledge as the “best of Fruits”, “whose taste… at first
assay / Gave elocution to the mute, and taught / The Tongue not made for Speech
to speak thy praise”.  Significantly, in Milton’s version the most tempting
quality of the fruit is rationality: Eve sees that the Serpent “knows, and speaks,
and reasons, and discernes” and, desiring this “intellectual food”, she eats
the apple, greedily gorging “without restraint”.  A woman’s intellectual
curiosity, inseparable from sensual abandon, precipitates the Fall of Mankind,
instates the central myth of nostalgia in Western symbology, and is a synonym
for disaster.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A major expression of this
myth has been the traditional prescription of silence for women, a silence
posited in relation to women’s reputed loquacity.  It is important to remember
that the language and rationality of men has never held the same dangers as
that of women, although of course heretics of both sexes (both within and
outside the church) have always been persecuted and murdered.  Heretic men
chose to speak outside a public arena already prescribed for them; women had no
such arena.  In Mediaeval France women were not even allowed to testify in
court; the only case in which their word was considered reliable was if they
had to attest (a word in itself derived from male sexual organs!) which of
twins arrived first.  “Teach women neither reading nor writing,” said the
theologian Philippe of Novarre.  He was more extreme than many, but
nevertheless the untrustworthiness and triviality of women’s tongues is a
byword: we still, for example, speak of trivial timewasters of either sex as
“old women”. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The Romantics’ spin on
traditional misogynistic ideologies was their appropriation of feminine
qualities, metamorphosed into the ability to give birth and nurture, into the
male body of a Genius.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> 
The Romantic relationship of Genius to the patriarchal God is clear in Thomas
Carlyle’s description of the Man of Genius: </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>The most precious gift that
    Heaven can give to the Earth: a man of ‘genius’ as we call it; the Soul of a
    man actually sent down from the skies, with a God’s-message to us ... A
    messenger he, sent from the Infinite Unknown ... We may call him Poet, Prophet,
    God ...” <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> 
    </p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Male Genius, however,
appropriated into itself the feminine qualities of sensitivity and nurturance,
even morbidity and hysteria; great artists “gave birth” to their work,
gestating them behind their magnificent foreheads.  Women’s bodies were too
fragile to sustain the fiery daemon of Genius without causing harm to
themselves; talented women, like Elizabeth Barrett Browning, were condemned to
illness and early death.  If by some freak of nature they survived their Genius
they were held to be, like George Sand, deviant men.  Women’s creative impulses
were totally fulfilled in childbirth and any woman seeking fulfilment in art
was a freak of nature, a perversion.  It is not, alas, an idea which has
vanished.  As recently as 1989, George Steiner was able to ask seriously:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Is there in the almost total
    absence from drama of any major woman writer some formidable hint?  Is the
    biological capacity for procreation, for engendering formed life which is
    cardinal to woman, in some way, at some level, absolutely primordial to a
    woman’s being, so creative, so fulfilling, as to subvert, as to render
    comparatively pallid, the begetting of fictive personae which is the matter of
    drama and of so much representative art? <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
title="">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Aside from Steiner’s apparent total
ignorance of the fact that theatre is the most social of all the arts, and that
this might have implications for women’s participation in it, he rather
traditionally couches male genius as an envy of female procreation (and the
creativity of a patriarchal God), and metaphorically assimilates the act of
“birth” to the male.  This infusion of female potencies into the male corpus
was an idea carried forward enthusiastically into modernism through such
writers as Nietzsche, although, as we shall see, it is an ancient trope.  A
typical C20<sup>th</sup> explication of male and female creativity is Jung’s
analysis, in which he permits a woman the role of helpmeet, and reserves
originatory creativity for men:  </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Just as man brings forth his
    work as a complete creation out of his inner feminine nature, so the inner
    masculine side of a women brings forth creative seeds which have the power to
    fertilise the feminine side of the man.  <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
title="">[6]</a> 
  </p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The confusion of the ideas of
female and feminine and the almost non-existent interrogation of notions of
masculinity in relation to men make this a particularly confused area in post
modern thinking, where femininity has sometimes been valorised despite an
almost total exclusion of the female in a depressingly familiar way.  This
appropriation works through a mask of neutrality, an apparent genderlessness
which permits the male to stand as the signifier for all humankind and to deny
his maleness, putting the burden of sex wholly on women, who are defined
continuously by their sexual status.  I’d like to orient my discussion by
quoting from Maria Black and Rosalind Coward’s 1981 essay, <u>Linguistic,
social and sexual relations</u>:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>We do not see the problem [of
    sexism in language] as one of the suppression of female meanings, nor do we see
    the solution as simply validating everything produced by women, as the
    expression of pre-existent feminine values.  We see one of the major political
    problems confronting feminism to be the need to force men to recognise
    themselves as <i>men</i>.  The discursive formation which allows men to
    represent themselves as non-gendered and to define women constantly according
    to their sexual status is a discursive formation with very definite effects. 
    It allows men to deny the effect of their gendered subjectivity on women.  ...
    What is available to them is a discourse where gender and sexual identity
    appears to be absent.... Men are sustained at the centre of the stage precisely
    because they can be ‘people’ and do not have to represent their masculinity to
    themselves. <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The mystic texts captured my
attention initially because of their often amazing sensuality and eroticism. 
But they are also interesting because they are instrumental in inaugurating a
new Western vocabulary for inner consciousness which has been influential to
this day.  Historian Danielle Régnier-Bohler points out that lexical studies
have shown that Meister Eckhardt and Ruusbrook would not have written as they
did had it not been for the women who preceded them.<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a>  These influences can be traced
in later writings, such as those, for example, of St John of the Cross in the
erotic mysticism of the <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, the more famous descendants
eclipsing their forerunners in much the same way as Elvis Presley appropriated
and obscured the music of black musicians.  “They invented a novel diction,”
says Régnier-Bohler of the Beguine nuns: “a comprehensive language that made
room for the body in the spiritual vocabulary”.  This has clear resonances with
contemporary ideas about writing the body: but there are important
differences.  One is the emphasis placed on rationality in many of the
Mediaeval texts, and another is the mystic erasure or elision of self, which
can be seen, rather than an abnegation of power, as an appropriation of the
male right to be sexless and ungendered: the right to represent humankind.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is commonplace to attribute
the sometimes extreme mysticism of the women of that time to hysteria, the
madness traditionally supposed to be caused by vapours rising from the womb
which cloud and destroy judgement.  Julia Kristeva’s take on mystical elements
in literature is not, I think, inaccurate, but it is incomplete: “...literature
is probably a version of the apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no matter what
its sociolo-historical conditions might be, on the fragile border (borderline
cases) where identities (subject/object, etc.) do not exist or only barely so —
double, fuzzy, heterogenous, animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject.”  <a
href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>  However, Kristeva’s analysis
of abjection and its relation to the excluded maternal/female “filth”, which is
at once violently rejected and sacralised, takes the male subject as its
normative centre.  The female, or the feminised Jew, is the “Other”, dealt with
only in its distorted relationship to a normative male subjectivity.  This
refuses the possibility of another subject, a female subject which asserts
itself as its own centre.  (I use male and female advisedly here, since I do
not wish to enter into discussions of masculine and feminine as free floating
values, as they seem to adhere stubbornly to a male norm.)  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is this re-placed subject
which interests me, because I see its possibility shining fitfully through
these texts, obscure and difficult and ambiguous as they are.  It is precisely
in these ambivalences and violations of social norms that I believe this
subject situates itself very carefully in relation to the prevailing orthodoxies.
Adducing these strategies as a kind of sexual hysteria elides and trivialises
their possibilities, by focussing on the pre-linguistic feminine at the expense
of the desire towards the forbidden fruit of intellectual rationality.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In discussing the rash of
prophetic outbursts which occurred during the Interregnum after the English
Civil War, the historian Keith Thomas notes that women were denied access to
any public expression in church, state or university.  He says, a little
myopically, that women who attempted to break into these male preserves were
“very liable to develop a bizarre exterior”.  “Indeed, the prominence of women
among the religious prophets of this period is partly explained by the fact
that the best hope of gaining an ear for female utterances was to represent
them as the result of divine revelation”.  And he adds, though this time not in
relation to female prophecies:  “The claim to divine inspiration was an
accompaniment to radical politics... the overwhelming majority of those who
claimed divine authority for their utterances were seeking authority for a
religious or social program”.  <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without suggesting that these
women had any sense of modern feminist consciousness, it seems a fair
supposition that female prophets were asserting their right to be articulate
and public human beings, able to comment on and perhaps influence public life,
and using what resources were then available to them: in this case, that of
divine revelation.  I think this strategy is particularly clear earlier in <i>The
Book of Margery of Kempe</i>.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the Middle Ages, despite
the prevailing misogynies, gender and sex were fluid concepts: </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Medieval medical views of sex,
    inherited from Aristotle and Galen, suggested that one’s sex category was
    located along a continuum; the distinction between males and females was
    essentially that the genitals of the males were outside and the (identical)
    genitals of the female were enclosed...; hermaphrodites were that rare instance
    of a place in the middle of the continuum (emblematic of the Adamic state).
    Moreover, the Patristic assertion, attributable as far back as Jerome and
    repeated in the Middle Ages, was that a woman could in some way become a man by
    vowing chastity and living an ascetic life. This commonplace of spirituality
    itself would suggest that gender was viewed in the Middle Ages at least as much
    as a performance, a construction, as it was viewed as a biological given, an
    essential or ontological state of being. The history of medieval transvestism
    would also seem indicative of such a performative notion of gender.... Bynum
    concludes that medieval theory acknowledged the “permeability or
    interchangeability of the sexes,” although “the male body is paradigmatic” <a
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This suggests a window of
possibility which was fully exploited by the Beguines and other women who
wanted to adopt the “male” role of speaking in public or obtaining spiritual
authority.  Educated humanists such as Christine de Pisan could battle for the
right to speak in the narrow arena of letters and had no hesitation in picking
up the battle to defend her sex, especially in her famous arguments against the
<i>Roman de la Rose</i> and in her epic poem <i>The City of Women</i>.  But in
order to do so, de Pisan first transformed herself into a man, “unsexing”
herself, like Lady Macbeth, in order to be a literary male: <i>Insignis Femina,
Virilis Femina</i>.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The mystics were in many cases
doing something even more subversive.  They developed what Danielle
Régnier-Bohler calls an “emotional dialect, well adapted to vigorous self
expression, to spontaneity and immediacy.  They “aspired to speak not the
language of men, but a language that was at once less and more”.<a
href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>  They demanded that language
express the inexpressible and in so doing stretched its boundaries to include
their own experiences and desires.  In theatricalising the self, as did Margery
of Kempe, or erasing it, as in the immolatory love theologies of women such as
Beatrice of Nazareth, they challenged the central supremacy of the male subject
and placed their own desires and passions centre stage.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Considerations of these texts
must also take into account the politics of the vulgate: of which, more later. 
And it is important to remember that they were heavily mediated and reviewed by
Church authorities.  Many mystics were illiterate, and had to rely on male
scribes to relate their experiences, some of whom ingeniously sought to
“improve their style”.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> 
Their decision to write down their experiences so others could read them always
followed mediation with a confessor, which confuses the provenance and
transparency of the texts still further.  Almost all the writings begin with
protestations of the woman’s unworthiness to speak: quite often, this melds
with a surprising confidence in the woman’s divine vocation for revelation.  A
typical example is this passage from Hildegard of Bingen’s <i>Scivias</i>:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>And I, a human being, neither
    ablaze with the strength of strong lions nor learned in their exhalations,
    remaining in the fragility of the weaker rib, but filled with mystical inspiration,
      <i>saw</i>:  [emphasis mine]<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">where Bingen’s confession of innate
female weakness and her lack of scholarly credentials serves rather to
intensify the force of her mystical inspiration, and the authority of her
vision.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Underneath the tropes of apology
and humility, the unworthiness, the necessary abjection of a woman daring to
speak at all, one reads again and again the making of a new space, a gap, which
constitutes an assault on the language of the times.  Usually unlettered in
Latin, and without the intellectual tools of educated men, they wrote in the
vulgate: Dutch, French, German, English.  Into the semantics of written
language, and drawing on the established traditions of “love mysticism” and
courtly poetry, they introduced a powerful and vivid metaphoric vocabulary of
sensual perception.  Marguerite d’Oingt describes a vision of a tree with five
branches, on which were written the names of the five senses; the texts again
and again resort to erotic imagery to describe the ecstasy of union with the
Godhead.  Spiritual states are described in terms of hunger, intoxication, and
physical passion, and in terms which made of the body a theatre of violence:
Beatrice of Nazareth, for example, speaks of love which “wants and devours all
things” which causes “the heart to beat so fast and furious that it feels
wounded through and through ... The veins seem to open, the blood to run out,
the marrow to wither.  Bones crack, the chest explodes, the throat is
parched...”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>   
</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">For these mediaeval women, the
articulation of emotional and spiritual lives was the reverse of private: it
was their means of un-privatising themselves, of moving out of a domestic or
cloistered sphere in which they were habitually confined into a public space
inhabited almost exclusively by men.  This had practical force: as a result of
her writings, Hildegard of Bingen embarked on a lecture tour of Europe when she
was sixty, and corresponded with the important European leaders of her time,
and Margery of Kempe made herself both adored and reviled, and most certainly
noticed, by her behaviours.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, the subversiveness of
these writers does not exist simply in the assertion of feminine values against
a phallic logocentric dominance.  This assumption has led to some misleading conclusions:
for example, in this statement, which suggests a mediaeval “proto-feminism” in
Julian of Norwich’s visions of a feminised Christ who gives suck and endures
pregnancy:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘mother-text’ does not
    manifest itself merely by the production of maternal imagery, but maternality
    and the text seem to become inextricably interwoven.  Further, I wish to
    illustrate that femininity and femaleness fuse with matrifocality — ‘the voice
    mixed with milk’ — forming a counterdiscourse which disturbs the patriarchal
    discourse of Christian theology.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">This ignores the established
Christian-Judaeic tradition, prevalent in Mediaeval times, of the appropriation
of feminine imagery of fertility into a male figure.  Dr Thomas E. Long traces
this image from Beothius’ <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, in which Philosophy
gives suck to the feminine soul, and also as a long recognised trope of
Jesus-as-Mother deriving from Anselm.  He points out that the three stereotypes
of motherhood used in this tradition — pregnant and sacrificial, loving and
tender, and nurturing — are also tropes used most often by male writers in
describing <i>themselves</i>. <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a> 
Which is to say that Julian’s vision of a maternal Christ disturbed no patriarchal
discourse but rather, existed comfortably within it.  As I noted earlier, the
potent feminised male is also a trope of Romantic genius and, as Luce Irigaray
comments, a characteristic of Jacques Lacan, who reserved to himself — and not
to women — the authority to speak of female pleasure.<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A simplistic view of feminine
assertion trivialises the ingenuity of the tactics used by writers such as
Julian of Norwich or Margery of Kempe, who worked creatively within the limits
of contemporary orthodoxies, appropriating their authorities to validate their
own experiences and their right to speak.  In order to escape accusations of
heresy they had to work within recognisable conventions, on pain, literally, of
death, while pursuing an agenda which, even within its limits, was radical
enough: to speak publicly as women.  On more subtle levels, it’s possible to
find ingenious inversions of gender stereotypes.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">A suggestive example is Julian
of Norwich’s insistent coupling of moisture with life, and dryness with
death.   Mediaeval Aristotelian and Galenic definitions based the innate
inferiority of women on their moistness and coldness.  Heat and dryness were
male virtues, signifying wit and <i>ingenium</i>, but females were, as Galen
said, “imperfect, and it were, <i>mutilated</i>” due to their coldness and
wetness; assumptions which underlie later Romantic ideas of fiery male Genius.<a
href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>  In the light of this
assumption, it’s interesting to read Julian’s vision of Christ dying:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>I saw His sweet face as it
    were dry and bloodless with pale dying. ... </p>
  <p>This was a pitiful change to
  see, this deep dying. And also the [inward] moisture clotted and dried, to my
  sight, and the sweet body was brown and black, all turned out of fair,
  life-like colour of itself, unto dry dying. </p>
</blockquote>



<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:28.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:28.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>Bloodlessness and pain dried
within; and blowing of wind and cold coming from without met together in the
sweet body of Christ. And these four, -- twain without, and twain within --
dried the flesh of Christ by process of time. And though this pain was bitter
and sharp, it was full long lasting, as to my sight, and painfully dried up all
the lively spirits of Christ’s flesh. Thus I saw the sweet flesh dry in seeming
by part after part, with marvellous pains. ...</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>And methought the drying of
    Christ’s flesh was the most pain, and the last, of His Passion. </p>
  <p>For this word was shewed for
  the bodily thirst: the which I understood was caused by failing of moisture. <a
href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Throughout these passages, again and
again, the word “dry” occurs as a motif of deathliness, while moisture
signifies life.  Later Julian associates fluidity with prayer and godliness. 
This qualitative shifting of activity and life to moisture and passivity and
death to “drying” inverts a dominant metaphor about femininity and femaleness. 
But, as Dr Thomas E. Long warns, it is notoriously difficult to untangle Julian
of Norwich’s discourse from the surrounding traditions to find a “feminist”
consciousness.  What counts is her assertion of her authority to speak at all:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>What is irreducible... in
    Julian of Norwich’s <i>Shewings</i> are the traces of [an] authorized voice,
    insistent upon its authenticity against the canons of the male-dominated
    religious establishment, the besouled body from her cell empowering other more
    public women like the vexed and vexing Margery Kempe. <a href="#_edn21"
name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps the most significant
elision imposed by simply seeking a feminine imaginary in the texts is the
common assertion by mediaeval women of their right to the “intellectual fruit”
of rationality.  In her 12C adaptation of the Latin text of the life of
Catherine of Alexandria, <i>Vie de sainte Catherine</i>, <a href="#_edn22"
name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> written in Anglo-Norman
octosyllabic couplets, Clemence of Barking was described an intelligent and
eloquent woman whom “no dialectician on earth could defeat”.  When Catherine
took the Emperor to task, to “prove to him by logic” that his law was wrong, he
called on rhetoricians to “confound her so that she can make no further reply
and has to surrender publicly” and “maintain his honour and his law” against
this “powerful woman”.  She not only defeated the rhetoriticians, but converted
them to her point of view.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Elizabeth K. Schirmer, in her
essay <u>Orthodoxy, Textuality, and the “Tretys” of Margery Kempe,</u> looks in
detail at Kempe’s strategies of appropriation and subversion of the Church’s
textual authorities.  “By 1413,” writes Schirmer, “any layperson who claimed that
his or her spiritual welfare was independent from the institutional structures
of the church, or whose theology seemed independent of its teachings, could be
tried for heresy and persecuted for treason”.  The church sought to protect its
authority by strictly controlling lay vernacular spiritual texts.  Bishop
Arundel was the architect of the Lambeth Constitutions, which sought “to bring
the spread of reading and writing among laypeople firmly under the control of
Arundel and his church, thus preserving the clear distinctions between cleric
and lay, <i>literatus</i> and <i>illiteratus</i>, upon which rested so much of
that institution’s spiritual and temporal authority.”</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>In doing so, he sought to
    establish and enforce an implicit dichotomy between two ways of reading the
    Bible as text: the laity were to read the Bible as a structure of narratives,
    narratives that do their work in the realm of the devotional imagination; the
    clergy were to read it as a structure of words, words that provided them with
    the basis for developing and defending orthodox theology and doctrine. It was,
    to risk a simplification, an attempt to enforce a strict division between
    propositional logic and emotional response, intellect and affect. <a
href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In this context, Kempe’s
bounteous weeping and assertion of a direct relationship with God were clearly
dubious, and she was in fact accused of lollardism, the heresy deriving from
John Wyclif which demanded vulgate translations of religious texts so lay
people could develop their own unmediated experience with God, directly
threatening clerical authority.  In one episode in her book, Kempe is brought
to task by Bishop Arundel himself.  The result is that Kempe, like Catherine of
Alexandria, converts the Bishop, who commends her “manner of living” and proclaims
her to be “hyly inspyred wyth the Holy Gost”.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Again and again, she defends
    her orthodoxy in ways that work against the very heart of Arundel’s project:
    attacked for living a life deemed inappropriate for a married woman (her
    detractors often mention her wearing white and travelling alone, and at least
    one fears she will persuade other women to follow in her footsteps), and
    accused by clerics of heresy due to her “preaching” and her knowledge of the
    scriptures, she successfully defends herself by citing the scriptures, once
    even in Latin, in the course of remarkably theological-sounding debates. And
    just as Kempe proves her orthodoxy by appropriating a discourse (theological
    debate) that could prove her heresy, so she uses her ... meditations to legitimate
    exactly the behavior that calls her orthodoxy into question in the first place:
“preaching,” travelling alone, living chaste as a wife, and so forth. <a
href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Schirmer argues, like Lynn
Staley, that Kempe is properly “author” of her text, whether or not she in fact
wrote it (it is possible that she wrote it herself, using the intervention of a
priest merely as a necessary distancing trope but, like most of the book’s
claims, it is impossible to verify either way.) Arguing that many of Kempe’s
stories are fictional, Staley claims that the Book is a carefully composed text
that makes use of strategies such as appropriation and manipulation of generic
conventions to the deployment of deliberate ambiguities, familiar from post
modern literature. <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>
Such techniques recall the literary strategies of Merrano Jews in Inquisition
Spain, the tradition which inflected Spinoza’s texts, and which permitted him,
for example, to propose ideas such as the historical reading of the Bible in a
context of Judaeic orthodoxy in Holland.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Schirmer argues further that, through her
Book, Kempe gives textual status to her life:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>The text is not unlike Kempe’s tears, in
    that both authenticate her experiences and make them public, linking her
    interior and exterior, her spiritual and worldly lives and serving as a
    publicly visible conduit between them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Kempe was not alone among the
mystics in introducing a new range of language to the written word: the
language of sobs, cries, sleep, tears, screams, the “interstices of language”,
which shifted written language beyond mere words.   Margery of Kempe’s
excessive tears and screams drew priestly disopprobrium, a sign she converted
into further proof of her holiness and used as an occasion to voice severe
criticisms of the church.  It was <i>women</i> who understood Kempe’s extreme
behaviour, which perhaps expressed what they wanted to say themselves, and they
“only loved her the more”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a>. 
This wordless emotional identification and its reactive expression against
gendered silencing is not confined to mediaeval women; for example, Andrea
Brady notes, in her essay <u>100 Days, Poetic Pathos and Political Apathy</u>:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>In Cretan funerals in the
    early 20th century... the lament of the widow was instrumental rather than
    resigned: her complaint caused others to identify with her suffering, and thus
    subverted the misogynist authority which consigned her to poverty and
    diminished status.  Widows linked their own personal experience to collective
    representations of grief in order to sadden their audience; for them, the lament
    stalled the social invisibility which creeps over an isolated (unmarried)
    woman. <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Through its expression,
emotional identification becomes an instrument of belief and action.  When
Kempe was dictating her biography, it moved the priest to tears himself, so
much so that his vestments were drenched in them, and converting him to the
deep empathy required to write her story.  And this investment of the body with
spiritual authority extends into eroticism.  Sometimes the language can take a
modern reader aback: one of the high points of Margery of Kempe’s Book is a
conversation with Christ in which he tells her, using the intimate “thy”, that
“you may boldly when you are in your bed take me to you as thy wedded husband
and your dearworthy darling and you may boldly kiss my mouth”.   This invests
the metaphor of “Bride of Christ” with an intriguing literalism, and when taken
in tandem with Kempe’s struggle to attain chasteness and the somewhat comical
bargain she finally strikes with her husband (she agrees to pay his debts in
exchange for relinquishing his rights as a husband) begins to suggest a
fascinating possibility of female satisfaction, rather than abnegation, in the
idea of chasteness.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is clear throughout her
Book that Kempe’s erotic attraction to men does not disappear with her
enlightenment, but it begins to take another form: when she sees handsome men
in Rome, for example, she is overborne with emotion because of their similarity
to Christ.  The focus of her desire is her relationship with Jesus, an ideal
lover who is “always pleased” with her, and in whom she finds bliss
unattainable elsewhere.  (Perhaps it is important to remember at this point
that Kempe had already had thirteen children when she began her mystic
visions).  By asserting her orthodoxy and the direct nature of her divine
inspiration, Kempe clears a space in which her own desires take centre stage.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Georges Bataille’s history of
eroticism in the Christian church is somewhat eccentric, since it ignores the
rich history of sacred erotic writing through the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance and its expression, for example, in the work of Bernard de
Clairvaux, based on the Songs of Songs, which was a crucial starting point for
the mystic love theology of the Beguines.  He asserts, however, the central
place eroticism holds in religious experience:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Eroticism is the most moving
    of all realities; but it is nonetheless, at the same time, the most ignoble. 
    ... the contradictory aspects of eroticism appear in some way innumerable;
    their profundity is religious — it is horrible, it is tragic, it is still
    inadmissible.  Probably all the more so because it is divine.... In casting
    eroticism out of religion, men reduced religion to a utilitarian morality.<a
href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Bataille is discussing, as he
makes clear, <i>male</i> eroticism — the “essence of man”, as he describes it —
which he carefully divides from an implicitly anerotic female sexuality of
childbirth, care and nurturance.  The dark depths of sexuality, its sadism and
connection with death, are clearly a male concern, and Woman, as represented in
text and picture, is merely the object of inadmissible desire and fear, the
Other on which is projected or enacted male desire.  For all Bataille’s
eccentricity, he reflects a conventional discourse which dominates discussion
of eroticism, the central male subject and the object of desire (boy, girl,
Woman) predated by Death or the fixing gaze of the male onlooker. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The sacred eroticism in the
writings of mystic women is often no less violent than that lauded by
Bataille.  But it includes a strikingly wider range of sensual reference than
permitted into Bataille’s definitions: for example, Julian of Norwich’s rich
descriptions of fluidity and flow in her lactating Christ, whose blood is milk;
the places of all the senses in the writing, vision, touch, smell, taste,
hearing; its insistence on “delight”, however it might be placed in the midst
of suffering.  Gertrud of Heflta rehearses a typical trope:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>O most lovable radiance, when
    will you satisfy me with yourself?  If only I might here perceive the fine rays
    of your Venus-like beauty for a little while, and at least be permitted to
    anticipate your gentleness for a short time and pleasantly beforehand to taste
    you, my best share.  Ah, turn around now a little so that I may fix my look on
    you, flower of flowers.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">And until recently
commentators have treated tended to skirt around such visions as Margareta
Ebner’s suckling the infant Jesus:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>I have a statue of our Lord as
  a child in the manger.  I was powerfully attracted to it by my Lord with
  delight and desire and by His gracious request.  This was spoken to me by my
  Lord: “If you do not suckle me, then I will draw away from you and you will
  take no delight in me.”  So I took the image out of the crib and placed it against
  my naked heart with great delight and sweetness.... </p>
  <p>I am set afire by the ardent
    love coming from Him and am filled up by His presence and by His sweet grace so
    that I am drawn into the true enjoyment of His divine essence...</p>
</blockquote>
<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The eroticism of breast feeding has been
so suppressed in contemporary life that a few years ago newspapers reported the
case of a woman who rang an American radio station distressed by her sensual
feelings while she was feeding her baby, and was arrested for child abuse.  (If
that isn’t tragic, I don’t know what is.)  But this points to one reason why
many expressions of female eroticism have been overlooked by commentators,
apart from androcentric myopia: they are collected and neutralised under the
anerotic rubrics of “motherhood” and, more complexly, those of “wife” and
“bride”.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I do not have the space here
to trace the suppression of female sexuality through the ages, from Aristotle
to Freud, nor to examine in any but a schematic way the writerly intrigues
inherent in the mystical texts.  But I am suggesting that these texts show
women authorising their right to express themselves in writing and to speak in
public as women in a multiplicity of ways: as neuter representatives of
humanity in general; as rational and logical intellects; and as erotic, sensual
women.  They do so by skirting the orthodoxies which limit their expressiveness
with a variety of creative strategies.  To examine their works from a singular
point of view is not enough; they must be read with a multiple awareness which
takes into account the orthodoxies which surrounded and limited them.  And, as <i>specula</i>,
as mirrors, these texts suggest intriguing ways of looking at contemporary
practices.  They are most subversive in how they assert their rational basis
within contemporary orthodoxies, which permits them to clear a space for a
largely unheard female vocabulary which then becomes its own authority.  Mere
emotion is not enough; mere intellectuality would not satisfy their desires nor
permit a language for female expressiveness.  I find myself admiring the
ingenuity of the mystics I’ve considered here in negotiating these
contradictory necessities.  It seems to me a deeply poetic praxis.</p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Between the realities of the
written text and the read text, what was experienced and what is imagined,
there remains an unbridgeable gulf: historical, geographical and experiential. 
I can refer only to the words on the page, and what is primarily communicated
to me, as a secular contemporary reader, is a world of feeling.  But it is a
singularly displaced experience of emotion, very far from the communications of
feeling that are experienced, for example, in reading contemporary
“confessional” poems: there is a sense in which these texts are radically
impersonal, using distancing techniques and un-selving strategies in ways that
can strikingly recall some contemporary poetics.  And there are other
affinities with mysticism: for example, in his tract <u>The Poetics of
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</u>, Bruce Andrews demands “abjection”, a “humble and often
ingratiating spirit”, for the act of reading.  He wants “The self, the imagined
integrity, wrecked”, to release a state where “subjectivity gets felt as a
complex bodily surface, with the familiarities of the person subject to an
ecstatic clearing and extension”.  He asks: “Inscription on the body: shouldn’t
we admit that this is how radical texts work?”   Andrews writes of the “flesh
igniting”, as the mystics wrote of being devoured by the fire of love, and
defines reading as atemporal, just as mystic texts assert visionary experiences
exist “outside time”.<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a></p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">However, Andrew’s approach
differs from the mystical “aesthetic”, if I may call it that, by eschewing
meaning and rationality as harbingers of the textual authority his poems wish
to disrupt.  This idea derives from the feminist practice of writers such as
Helen Cixous and Luce Irigaray, who have explored the Lacanian notion of the
feminine imaginary as a liberating focus for female expressiveness.  I am not
saying that this is not a rich field for work, since I also work with some of
these principles.  But I find a certain problem in this valorising of the
pre-linguistic state as uniquely feminine, in that it does not greatly disturb
traditional female ascriptions.  In the case of Bishop Arundel, it is clear
that a purely emotional reaction to texts and scripture by lay people was
considered desirable by the English Church, because it left intellectual
textual interpretation to the authorities.  It is no accident, I believe, that
writers as diverse as Gillian Rose and Lyn Hejinian have recently defended the
idea of Reason, in different ways both severing reason from authority; they
perceive that not to do so is to leave rationality as the unquestioned property
of power.  Feminine irrationality courts the seductive danger of appearing to
be subversive while in fact satisfying all sorts of time-hallowed prejudices
about femaleness, and, if valorised within an implicitly male subject, can
easily become again a category which leads to the exclusion of dissenting or
strong female voices.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">To conclude with a brief
sojourn in the present, I have begun to think that the biggest effect of
September 11 on me personally has been a return to concentrated thinking about
gender and sex.  I was taken aback, in the days after the event, by how
gendered arguments were hastily, even aggressively, dismissed on listservs, as
if the issue of gender and sex is just a secondary, somewhat wimpish
consideration in such extremities and has nothing to do with “important”
discourses on the mechanisms of power.  I clearly think otherwise, and in
looking into the mirrors of women writing 700 years ago, perhaps I was trying
to clarify for myself some questions about what I see operating around me, in
different ways, admittedly, but also in patterns which have a depressing
familiarities.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Female silencing, as I hope I
have shown, is a complex matter, and I add that such silence must be thought of
in terms which admit aphasia as a possible silence.  The most potent silencing
of women is, in a liberal democracy, that censorship observed by themselves. 
David Howard’s recent complaint on the Poetryetc listserv is not untypical of
many comments I’ve heard from poetry publishers over the past two decades:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>When I founded ‘Takahe’ in
    1989 the submissions in poetry were overwhelmingly from men — however the
    fiction submissions were far more balanced between men and women. This was the
    case for the five years of my stewardship. I pursued a policy of ignoring
    gender (and race, religion, height, weight, sexual tastes, colour of hair,
    favourite football team etc) in determining the make-up of any given issue.
    This meant that some issues featured work by nine men and three women, while
    others (generally through fiction contributions from women) reversed the
    statistical bias. It was, of course, only a statistical bias — something a few
    critics, including my successor as poetry editor, didn’t appreciate. After my
    retirement an unspoken quota was put in place which, in my view, undermined the
    fairness of the editorial process and reduced the overall quality of the
    journal. As Berenice Rubens commented, “I don’t want to be regarded as a Jewish
    British female novelist, I want to be regarded as a novelist who happens to be
    Jewish, British and female.’<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’ll gloss over the question
held in the words “statistical bias” here, because I want to focus on the
question of women moving into public space.  My personal experience of editing
shows me that the ratio of manuscripts submitted vary between one third and one
quarter from women, and <i>Voices</i>, the magazine once published by the
National Library of Australia, which kept records of all submissions, recorded
a similar disparity.  I am certain that this is more the norm than otherwise. 
This suggests that the prescription of silence for women is still active and
still working, but it seems to be primarily activated by an inner censorship
which makes it both difficult to define and very complex to trace.  And the old
Romantic model of the male Poet is still alive and well, as Frances Presley
points out:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Linda
    Russo’s point that “to be human and male is to write Poetry; to be female is
    talk and to grieve” holds true in England as in America. We even have a male
    poet laureate for such occasions. It seemed hardly less true of the avant-garde
    when at a large benefit performance held in London there were very few women
    performers.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The avant-garde of its nature
  suggests a male militaristic activity, and historically has tended to exclude
  women even more than its conservative counterparts. <a href="#_edn32"
name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>




<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The problematic public
articulations of feeling over the past year or so suggest other areas of
conjecture.  In her discussion of the political manipulation of public grief,
Andrea Brady says public expressions of feeling inevitably are manipulated by
conservative interests: “the reduction of political motivation to feelings,
like maternal care, and political thinking to intuition, effectively restricts
the political imaginary to local amelioration.”&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Grief and other emotions are
    (if anything) over-articulated and indulged on the box.  The soft-focus morning
    interventions for housewives, the ‘spirit’ sections in Borders, the ‘Awareness
    Movement’ have raised an army of consumers of emotional health. <a
href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>


<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Without arguing with Brady’s
principal analysis, with which I agree, there is here an equation between
“feminine” feelings (over-articulated and indulged housewives, maternal care)
and the sentimental, which it would be well to wary of: it is uneasily close to
traditional exclusions of women and women’s concerns from public discourse.  
If sentiment can be thought of as a coarseness, failure or even <i>absence</i>
of feeling, which I believe it is, then it is the sentimentalisation of public
articulations of feeling which is the problem, rather than the expression of
feeling itself.   Motherhood is not <i>a priori </i>an area of sentiment: and
it might be interesting to inquire why its public portrayal almost always is
sentimental, in the spirit of wondering what possibilities are hidden beneath the
vaseline.  The commodification of feeling implicit in the phrase “consumers of
emotional health” points to the reasons why this might have happened.
Articulations of emotion in popular media often seem to me to be <i>suppressions</i>
of feeling, rather than its articulation — they are expressions, rather, of
aspirational material goals remarkable for their lack of connection to the
complexity and liberating possibilities of actual emotions.  The constant
conflation of these popular sentimental clichés with actual experiences no
doubt accounts for a large percentage of the profit margins of pharmaceutical
companies. </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In calling for a “language of
feeling”, Frances Presley implies that the one we have is inadequate: what we
have available is a discourse too easily hijacked by authority.  This suggests
to me that the orthodoxies we are working with and against are so dominant as
to be barely challenged within their own domains.  On the other hand, there are
languages of feeling available to us: poetry being a major expression of them. 
How poetry is marginalised and discounted within the wider culture is a whole
other story.  I don’t believe this problem is unconnected with many of the
questions I’ve raised here, but I’ll leave that for further discussion.  </p>



<P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I’d like to thank Robert
Hampson and the Centre for Contemporary Poetics for giving me the chance to
think about all this, and all of you for listening.</p>
