      <P CLASS="TITLE1">Inappropriated Others</P>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Perhaps there is nothing more reassuring to existing 
        social orders than a love story in which boy pursues girl and they live 
        happily ever after.  This romance plot has been criticized by multiple 
        feminist, and now queer, critics—not only for how it is gendered, but 
        also for how it authorizes heteropatriarchy.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Yet, while it is easy to criticize this 
        plot for how it typically produces gender and sexuality, what about love 
        itself?  Is the very plot of a lover intensely pursuing a beloved inherently 
        retrogressive?    Many psychologists and cultural theorists, particularly 
        those who study object relations theories, would seem to wish to correct 
        for intense, obsessive love through an emphasis on relations of reciprocity 
        and exchange.   And, many avant garde writers attempt to void positionality 
        itself, opting for an erotics of language.</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            But is this cultural transformation so 
        simply in the offing?  Or even desirable?  Roland Barthes in <i>A Lover’s 
        Discourse</i> responds to this dilemma by turning a lover’s heightened 
        utterances into an array of discourses.  He would seem to want to have 
        it both ways, inscribing intense love declarations, singularly experienced 
        and delivered; yet dispersing (if multiplying) their energies by arranging 
        them as fragments through alphabetized topics.   Taking his discourses 
        from some of the most revered literary sources from classical times onwards, 
        Barthes barely hints at the difference his own homosexuality might make 
        to these writings. Nor does he address the complex cultural and historical 
        realities from which these love writings are produced, side stepping political 
        and social issues in order to locate an entirely delicious love, “warranted 
        by no one.”  </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            The writers in this section actively 
        take on the position of a lover besotted by a beloved.  And, in each piece, 
        the writers transgress those lover and beloved relations that serve to 
        underwrite existing social orders.  This happens, in part, because each 
        lover is not a heterosexual male who through his love for his female beloved 
        constitutes his literary authority.  But also, perhaps more importantly, 
        the lovers are drawn to inappropriate beloveds—engaging in intense acts 
        of inappropriation. </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            In his pursuit of the elusive Australian 
        pop singer, Kylie Minogue, Kevin Killian extols her precisely because 
        she “will never win any awards, for nothing.”  Kylie “is a second-or third-rate 
        talent more precious than any of a number of big time genuises.”   In 
        his familiar patois, eschewing the proper in all its manifestation, including 
        stately diction, Kevin decamps his own camp gestures, attempting to keep 
        Kylie from being consumed by a culture-making machine—or at least keeping 
        a place within cultural formation that doesn’t overwrite unsettling desires 
        through an appropriating, finely wrought expression.  Speaking of himself 
        and other gay admirers of Kylie, Kevin writes, “Kylie fans re-settle the 
        unsettling haunt of sexuality by our insistence on customization—adapting, 
        subverting its broad strikes to our own homey use.  It’s this impulse—gears 
        shifting downward from public to private—that Kylie understands and illuminates 
        beautifully… there’s an empty, spooky sigh at the heart of this work.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Dodie Bellamy also takes on an inappropriate 
        other—only to deliver him and her female narrator, Carla Moran, to further 
        inappropriation.  In having a relationship with a man she met through 
        email, Carla, a poet, meditates on how this relationship is “writing made 
        flesh.”  Attempting initially to disguise her love connection with Ed 
        from even casual bystanders—because he is fat—Lala, as Carla is sometimes 
        called, comes to identify with him: “I watch fat men now, this secret 
        ostracized world of ridicule and invisibility.  I feel scorn for the mainstream, 
        the hip, the cool.”  As Ed comes to distance himself from Carla, the narrative 
        exfoliates into brilliant phantasmagoric passages in which Lala explores 
        what it means to be rejected by the culturally abjected:  “I dreamt I 
        was having trouble shitting and began pulling whole cabbage leaves out 
        my butt.  I showed them to Ed and he said I needed to chew my food better…. 
        The specially attuned don’t realize I’m a ghost—until one day they wake 
        up and the mansion we’ve been flirting through is burnt out and strewn 
        with leaves.  A little girl in an antique dress leads Ed to my tombstone.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Christine Stewart pursues an inverse 
        strategy to Kevin and Dodie, telling how her anonymity, her illicit love, 
        constitutes St. Augustine’s holy reverence. She draws attention to how 
        his cultural dignity and power are constituted through her “lush obscurity,” 
        remarking “I did not kill your corrupt authority—I gave it life.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She addresses St. Augustine:</p>
      <p style='line-height:150%'>            Do you recognize your own unique 
        cupidity,</p>
      <p style='line-height:150%'>            your over-souled package</p>
      <p style='line-height:150%'>            that central radiating genitalia,</p>
      <p style='line-height:150%'>            that generates mutiny in my vehicle. 
      </p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">She breaks down his dignified removal by “moving 
        towards” him:  “St Augustine, if you speak the words father or kitchen 
        / you will split the sides of your mouth./  Instead I will kiss the sides 
        of your mouth.”</p>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">            Roland Barthes concludes <i>A Lover’s 
        Discourse</i> by considering the subject of  “<i>vouloir-saisir / </i>will-to-possess.”  
        Quoting Nietzsche, he writes, &quot;I do not want to replace the intense 
        throes of passion by ‘an impoverished life, the will-to-die, the great 
        lassitude.’ The N.W.P [the non-will-to-possess] is not on the side of 
        kindness, the N.W.P. is intense, dry….”   While if in the concluding section 
        of his book, Barthes offers a number of sublime considerations to the 
        issue of how possessive or non-possessive one should be with respect to 
        one’s beloved, he does quite clearly state how overly chastened desire 
        may not be “on the side of kindness.”    And here “kindness” should be 
        read, as a dispensation of the subject toward others, toward kind through 
        kindness.  If there is one quality that all three inappropriating writings 
        in this section share it is their kindness toward,  rather than binary 
        differentiation from, the others they pursue.</p>
