      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">A Review by Catherine Daly</P>
      <P CLASS="TITLE2" ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><blockquote>
      <div class=DOUBLESPACE> 
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In her first book, Genevieve Taggard writes poems 
    recognizable in theme:  they are poems of a young woman in a poetry community 
    where she finds few positive female examples for writing or being, yet wishes 
    to write from her experience as a woman, wife, and mother.  Although I have 
    read disparaging comparisons of these lyric poems to those of Sara Teasdale, 
    Elinor Wylie, or Edna St. Vincent Millay, including those made by the poet 
    herself later in her life, I find key differences:  Taggard is not a member 
    of the middle class during this period of her life, as Teasdale and Wylie 
    were; she is political and feminist, but her politics are not Ridge’s anarchism 
    or Millay’s flapper version of the “new woman”; she is well educated, with 
    a degree from UC Berkeley; she is a versifier, but she is not a particularly 
    fine sonneteer or notable epigrammatist.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, Taggard genericized 
    her unhappy relationship to Robert L. Wolf in a series of poems where a female 
    speaker alternately pleads to see the beloved / lover and begs to be left 
    alone, “Married,” “Leave Me Alone a Little,” “Black Laughter,” “The Quiet 
    Woman,” and “Unacknowledged Dedication” among them.  Marital discord is depicted; 
    phrases including “thick vowels,” “black laughter,” and “words too thick to 
    say” are used in different poems to indicate words spoken in anger.  In “Black 
    Laughter,” she writes:</p>
  <P>            See what a cripple our love is!<br>
                It is sullen; sometimes it makes walls of black laughter;<br>
                It is fond of words, fond of thick vowels,<br>
                It mimics thunder.<br>
                Between us it limps…</p> </p>
 <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the poem which follows “Black Laughter” in the 
    collection, “The Quiet Woman,” she seems to describe a woman having nonconsensual 
    sex:  “If you knew…” how the narrator thought and felt, “You would not lean 
    . . . to kiss my body, quivering and cold.”  In “Little Hamlet,” she switches 
    roles:</p>
          <P>           Over you, over you, over,<br>
                I hang like a wave, like a lover,<br>
               Like a scimitar edged with hate. . .</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>For Eager Lovers </i>is, among other things, 
    a warning to young women.  In the poems, Taggard does not show only romanticism 
    and the personal, as do Wylie and Teasdale.  She is not interested in showing 
    the “suffering of love,” but rather, the ways in which personal or emotional 
    suffering imperils a woman writer.  While <i>For Eager Lovers </i>is dedicated 
    to her then-husband, she writes, in “Unacknowledged Dedication,”</p>
  <P>           These were his songs.  Now he has broken them.<br>
                 All he has made, that he has also slain;<br>
               Seeing my beauty budding, broke the 
    stem . . .</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Taggard’s first husband, Robert L. Wolf, was a poet 
    who never published a book of poetry.  By contrast, during the period the 
    poems in <i>For Eager Lovers</i> were written, Taggard worked for a major 
    publisher of poetry in New York (Huebsch, which published Lola Ridge, among 
    others) and was a founding editor of a well-known journal, <i>Measure</i>.  
    Wolf seems to have been ambivalent about parenthood; Taggard supported the 
    small family so that he could write. </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poem “Everyday Alchemy,” one of the two Taggard 
    chose to reprint in <i>Calling Western Union, </i>to give the poem an impersonally 
    political context instead of the personal and political one here, is a poem 
    in which Taggard defines her metaphysic.  Because Taggard edited an anthology 
    of metaphysical-influenced verse and was the first to argue that Emily Dickinson 
    was a latter-day metaphysical poet, critics suggest that Taggard was influenced 
    by the metaphysicals.  Taggard explicitly uses John Donne’s extended metaphor 
    and unusual imagery in his love poems in <i>For Eager Lovers</i>.  In “Everyday 
    Alchemy,” she sets out the binary relationship between nature and “worn men” 
    who will never know nature.  </p>
  <P>           . . . There<br>
                      Is all the meager peace men get—no otherwhere; <br>
              No mountain space, no tree with placid leaves, <br>
              Or heavy gloom beneath a young girl's hair,<br>
              No sound of valley bell on autumn air,<br>
                      Or room made home with doves along the eves . . . </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Nature has peace.  Women can create peace, but not 
    for themselves.  Men cannot know the peace of nature or create peace.  In 
    “Ice Age,” in which Taggard extends her rhymed lyric across several pages, 
    she imagines a future ice age that  will destroy the abundant and always tropical 
    and Hawaiian nature which is her moral good.  In this cold dystopia, only 
    “singing” matters.  As in “Everyday Alchemy,” men are the singers, but only 
    worn women can create, and only a little bit, and this creation ultimately 
    saps their strength:</p>
  <P>            Men will go on<br>
                Making vague love, kissing wan faces.<br>
                Trying to make<br>
                Children with women . . .</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The poems in the pamphlet <i>Hawaiian Hilltop</i>, 
    published a year after <i>For Eager Lovers</i>, continue to develop these 
    ideas.  Although Taggard does not identify either gender with nature,  she 
    sets men in binary opposition to nature while she represents women and children 
    interacting with nature’s bounty.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Motherhood, in Taggard’s view, is embedded in the 
    fecundity of nature and the necessary communality of marriage.  In “With Child,” 
    she identifies the period of pregnancy as one during which her body, not her 
    desiring self, is associated with nature, while her fetus, not her body, is 
    associated with beauty.  The poem begins as Taggard distinguishes herself 
    from standards of beauty:</p>
  <P>            Now I am slow and placid, fond of sun,<br>
                 Like a sick beast, or a worn one:<br>
                No slim and languid girl . . .</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In the center of the poem, she carefully delineates 
    her relationship to nature and to the child:</p>
  <P>            Earth’s urge, not mine – my little death, 
    not hers;<br>
                 And the pure beauty yearns and stirs 
    . . .</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is important to note that, as on the page, in 
    life she never seems to have shirked her responsibilities as a mother.  She 
    depicts the economic effects and social ramifications of childbearing and 
    rearing in her writing, but she always writes positively about and for children 
    of both sexes.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After Wolf was institutionalized and the couple 
    divorced, Taggard remarried.  It is not until this remarriage, to an American 
    working for Tass, that Taggard became middle class, with teaching jobs at 
    small liberal arts colleges and a farm in Vermont to use during vacation periods.  
    Taggard displays a great deal of tendentious sympathy for working poor and 
    poor blue collar workers, as well as for urban immigrant women, but quite 
    little for the rural poor whites and white collar working class people of 
    her own experience.  </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">* * * </p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There are three “girl poems” in <i>For Eager Lovers</i>:  
    “Tropical Girl to Her Garden,” “The Enamel Girl,” and “Tired Girl.”  This 
    type of descriptive lyric of a part-icon, part-muse, part-self is fairly common 
    to find in twentieth century first books of poetry by women.  This type of 
    poem represents an attempt to objectify poetry itself.  However, the Lady 
    of Shalott, Laura, or any number of other female muses / female stand-ins 
    for poetry itself in poetry written by men are almost “ready mades” in terms 
    of objectification.  When a woman is the poet, the objectified woman is an 
    aspect of self as well as a muse or poetry.  This figure is most often a “girl” 
    – younger, dumb/mute or less intelligent, and less experienced – partially 
    because she is objectified.  In some respect, these figures of Taggard’s are 
    her children – creations, and she is mothering these aspects of herself; she 
    very clearly repeats in the poems that it is men who “sing,” “name,” or write 
    poems – while the collection includes “song” poems with refrains and choruses, 
    most of her poems create worlds or instruct rather than identify or describe.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">In “Tropical Girl to Her Garden,” the girl is nature, 
    speaking against cultivation.  While the Hawaiian girls in the poems in <i>Hawaiian 
    Hilltop </i>are native “others,” this girl is an “I,” the narrator:</p>
   <P>            Withhold your hand!<br>
                   My boughs are bent with gold  . . . <br>
                 . . .<br>
                 My heavy fruit will fall without a touch</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Only by speaking as nature can Taggard, as a human, 
    relate to nature, and only a woman, in her view, could relate to nature.  
    In “Enamel Girl,” Taggard discusses beauty and artifice.  The girl who speaks 
    is afraid of beauty, which is always outside or “other” for a female.  She 
    would be a fragile object among fragile objects, except that she has learned 
    she has power to destroy beauty.  The “you” – addressee, lover, reader – has 
    taught her to fear her power:</p>
   <P>            . . .<br>
                        . . . I wound a wing <br>
            <br>
                       With one caress, with one kiss<br>
               Break most fragile ecstasies . . .   <br>
    <br>
                       Now terror touches me when I<br>
               Dream I am touching a butterfly.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">and to fear poetry-writing.  In “Tired Girl,” the 
    girl is in the third person.  The narrator is asking nature to let the girl 
    rest or die (recalling the saying, “you can sleep when you’re dead”) so that, 
    reborn, she can become a woman like those in “Everyday Alchemy,” who, while 
    tired, can create “peace” for men, and also write:</p>
   <P>           After she ponders under silent hills,<br>
               Beneath your swarming bosom, Mother Earth,<br>
               She will have words for her beloved one.</p>
  <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">The girl poems contain the same metaphysical meanings 
    Taggard began to develop in this first book and continued to develop throughout 
    her career.  They display some of Taggard’s struggles to write as a female 
    poet with few female poet forebears as well as her struggles as a working 
    mother.  She struggles not to romanticize her experiences.  She addresses 
    different audiences in different poems.  She attempts various forms of address 
    and depiction as she searches for a form and content beyond male standards 
    of “beauty” and civilization’s association of women with natural beauty and 
    untutored artifice.  The poems are political and feminist, but they are also 
    individualistic.  </p>
