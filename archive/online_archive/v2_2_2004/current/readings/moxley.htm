      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Steve and I had been living in Providence for about 
          seven months when we were requested to present ourselves at five o’clock 
          sharp at the door of that renowned address, 71 Elmgrove, for <i>drinks</i>. 
          As we knew our destination to be but a five-minute walk we at first 
          thought to set out on foot, but it was mid-January and the weather was 
          raw and so we decided to take the car. Past the nineteen-fifties era 
          shops lining Wayland Square we drove, until we came upon the long, straight, 
          and peaceful Elmgrove Avenue, which though naked of elms for many years 
          yet boasted other fine trees and many neatly manicured houses. We had 
          been told that if we should pass “University” we would have gone too 
          far, but in our California optimism we had not accounted for the fact 
          that many Providence streets remain totally free of signage. We could 
          not find “University” nor see the numbers on many of the houses and, 
          after some minutes and several long blocks, it became distressingly 
          apparent that we were lost. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">We were now going to be late. We turned our car 
          around and headed back towards Wayland. Finally, behind a great, bold, 
          holly tree we espied an empty brick driveway that lead to the desired 
          number. The house awaiting us was dim and brooding, painted the darkest 
          of browns, with a forest green trim, as if it were dressed to be camouflaged 
          behind the masculine holly standing guard out front. No curtain was 
          drawn, no sound nor light emanated from within, all was totally quiet. 
          There was a strange metal box sitting by the door and an outdoor thermometer 
          reading 38 degrees nailed into a shingle. Steve pushed the doorbell 
          beside the heavy wooden door but, hearing no sound from within, he also 
          lifted the heavy brass knocker and gave it a few loud raps. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Though Keith stood in the hallway to bid us welcome 
          it was Rosmarie who opened the door. She was a small woman who looked 
          to be in her mid-fifties, with short, gray, attractively soft hair and 
          childlike eyes and smile, her youthful features temporarily distorted 
          by a look of worry provoked by our lateness. “Come in, come in,” she 
          said, in a somewhat hurried fashion, throwing one hand up into the air. 
          She seemed impatient to dispense with niceties and get quickly to real 
          conversation. It was then I noticed that she spoke with a slight accent 
          which, though I knew it to be German, did not sound German in the traditional 
          way. It was high and merry with what might be described as a <i>slight 
          growl</i> underneath, most evident when she chuckled. We were led through 
          not one door but two, to be greeted by Keith, a delicate looking man 
          with a long white beard and moustache, dressed in a diamond checked 
          pullover, dark trousers and house slippers. Before we could take two 
          steps he lifted aside a heavy curtain and, with a graceful sweep of 
          his hand, escorted us into the living room. All during this introduction 
          I had the distinct impression that I was walking through a large Victorian 
          curio cabinet or a Joseph Cornell box, the walls of which were made, 
          not of lathe and plaster nor dry-wall, but of thousands of old books. 
          These “book walls” tested our <i>politesse</i>, for it was all that 
          Steve or I could do not to turn our eyes from our hosts and begin, as 
          though we had come upon some bibliophilic paradise, to peruse the volumes 
          in earnest, searching, as one does in a used bookstore, for all the 
          books you suspect exist but have yet had the luck to find. Once inside 
          the living room, I saw to the left, in front of the fireplace, a long, 
          low, wooden bench. Every inch of this rough-hewn piece was burdened 
          with tall, rather precarious stacks of even more books. The right wall 
          of the room was entirely covered by many swathes of multi-colored fabric 
          hanging in soft sacs like some great organic anomaly, a vertical bed, 
          or a rare and rather sensuous three-dimensional wall-paper. Using her 
          reading glasses for a pointer, Rosmarie directed us to the two chairs 
          next to a little coffee table made out of tree stump with a piece of 
          Lucite on top of it. Steve took the Windsor and I the one that appeared 
          to have been stolen from a cinema, for it had the tell-tale fold-down 
          seat and holes in the base through which it had most likely been, in 
          its former life, riveted into a gummy floor. From there I could see 
          that the wall above the fireplace was covered with framed artworks, 
          many of which appeared to be collage. With the exception of one table 
          lamp and the luminous glow from a rather precarious and somewhat outdated 
          space heater, the room remained in shadow. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As soon as we were seated Keith nestled down into 
          the facing rocker in such a way as to give the impression that he had 
          <i>only just left it</i>. Rosmarie remained standing and, clasping her 
          hands together asked, “white wine, red wine or scotch,” then, to our 
          baffled looks, responded, “why don’t we start with the white.” “<i>Start 
          with the white!</i>” I thought, “will she require us to drink it all 
          before the evening is through?” She disappeared, her light steps trailing 
          down the wooden floorboards of the hallway into some mysterious region 
          hidden from the strange, if surprisingly comfortable, book lair in the 
          middle of which we were now ensconced.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Rosmarie left us to the quiet of Keith’s rocking 
          for but a minute before returning with wine for us and a small glass 
          of orange juice for him. She also set between us, on the tree-stump 
          coffee table, a plate containing a dish of olives, salted almonds, and 
          a few rather challenging looking cheeses which soon seemed to be glistening 
          and ripening under the light from the goose-neck lamp hovering over 
          the table. Refreshments arranged, she then perched herself on the smaller 
          rocker to the side of the fireplace. After a welcoming toast, she began 
          the conversation by questioning us about our circumstance. As we had 
          come with a “verbal introduction” from our former professor Michael 
          Davidson, he was our first topic of discussion, after which Steve, being 
          a first-year graduate student, had plenty of fresh “department business” 
          to aid his initial remarks. Keith, though a full professor, was immediately 
          keen to differentiate himself from any talk of “the academy.” With a 
          marked delight he mocked the seriousness of his higher degree and then 
          told us that he had once been dismissed from an esteemed Connecticut 
          college for lecturing on DADA. I was under the burden of thinking myself 
          a talented young poet, but had little sense of how I might make this 
          known to my hosts, for I had no “official” role other than that of “Steve’s 
          girlfriend.” The incredibly diverse entourage of objects and books rescued 
          me from this awkwardness, for as titles caught my eye I could say, for 
          example, “<i>Zuleika Dobson</i>, is that any good?” Or, “I’ve heard 
          of <i>Botteghe Oscure</i>, but I’m not exactly sure what it is.” To 
          which Keith would respond, “Oh, that’s a wonderful novel,” or “that 
          was one of <i>the</i> great magazines.” Soon, however, this recourse, 
          and Keith’s confident responses, began to make me feel rather queer. 
          The wine had gone to my head and my eyes were starting to swim and drift 
          until, around the forty minute mark, I could scarcely distinguish between 
          book, collage and curio. The cheese filled my nose with some vague Parisian 
          memory and, when I noticed the sun had set and it was quite dark outside, 
          I began to feel as though Steve and I had been sitting in that living 
          room not for several hours, but for several days. The more great novels, 
          authors, places, operas, magazines and poems were brought up, very few 
          of which I had ever heard of, the less I seemed able to convince myself 
          of the uniqueness of my person. What I did not realize was that I was 
          becoming a victim of a serious malady which Steve has since coined as 
          “The Waldrop Effect,” the main symptom of which is the acute undoing 
          of one’s cultivated pretense. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Steve and I knew that our hosts were the publishers 
          of Burning Deck Press and, before we took our leave, we did not hesitate 
          to question them about this printing venture. At our interest Rosmarie, 
          who, unlike Keith, seemed hard-pressed to remain at rest, jumped up 
          and said “well, you must visit the dungeon!” Given my growing disorientation, 
          exacerbated by the onslaught of strange, literary references and the 
          several glasses of wine, I need hardly tell you the effect this dictum 
          had upon my psyche. “To the dungeon then!” Propriety would admit no 
          refusal. Out past the heavy curtain, down a dark hallway, through a 
          door, down a narrow flight of stairs, through several more doors, dim 
          lights illuminated <i>only as needed</i>, we descended in tandem to 
          the labyrinthine basement, the walls of which, I was astonished to find, 
          were also lined floor-to-ceiling with books. Seeing my bafflement Keith 
          gestured towards the dank volumes and then said, “European History.” 
          In a small room on the right we were shown their Heidelberg press, proudly 
          standing like the forgotten skeleton of some by-gone race of mechanical 
          beings. It was dark with ink and oil. There were two other, smaller 
          letter-presses and boxes upon boxes of metal type. How clean printed 
          volumes of delicate appearance issued from this dusty underground cavern 
          was mysterious indeed. But Rosmarie showed us several such chapbooks 
          before we made our ascent, stopping mid-way at a cold closet from which 
          she pulled some twenty-odd Burning Deck books to heap upon our outstretched 
          arms as a parting gift. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is now some eleven years since that first visit, 
          and I have sat in the living room of 71 Elmgrove more times than I can 
          possibly count. I have even spent a year in France undergoing an assiduous 
          course in alcohol consumption in order that I might someday keep up 
          with Rosmarie’s regime of “we’ll start with the white.” And yes, I have 
          matured. Since that first visit I have studied. I have read many books, 
          I have listened to many operas, I have tasted of many strange and odiferous 
          cheeses. Nevertheless I am still susceptible to succumbing to “The Waldrop 
          Effect.” And though I cannot tell you, dear reader, how to avoid this 
          curiously undocumented malady, I can describe the symptoms. The first 
          manifests itself mid-way through the evening when, slightly tipsy, your 
          insecurities awaken and your tongue loosens to such a degree that you 
          begin to pour all sorts of gossip into Rosmarie’s ear. The second arises 
          more slowly, but is more long lasting. You will know you are in the 
          midst of it when you feel that, no matter how broad and deep your education, 
          you know nothing at all. Nothing about film, nothing about dance, art, 
          opera, jazz, language, and especially nothing about literature. The 
          full dangers of “The Waldrop Effect,” however, only become apparent 
          once you leave that legendary living room. If, upon returning to your 
          private apartment, you fall face first onto your bed, head spinning 
          and belly full, and protract your misery with thoughts of the countless 
          books that Keith has read and you have not, then you know you are under 
          its sway. In that unflattering moment you may vow never to subject yourself 
          to its perils again. But I can with confidence assure you that, should 
          you recover your senses and break that vow, you will eventually grow, 
          if not immune, then at least more tolerant of its effects, and in time 
          you may even, as I confess I have, develop an <i>acute dependence</i> 
          on the rare company at its origin.&nbsp; </p>
