        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>The impulse to write about Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
          work came before my censoring mind could stop me. It came from a bubbling 
          up of appreciation and admiration for work which has inspired me for 
          many years. But, in the end, all my efforts at finding a way to write 
          “about” Waldrop’s work met with nothing but resistance. I wanted to 
          explore this resistance within myself. After reading Rosmarie Waldrop’s 
          “Meditation On Certainty,” I took a few notes.</i> </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>MEDITATION ON CERTAINTY</b> </p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The more a proposition hardens its glassy simplicity 
          tilts all fluids away from the body, all thoughts into sudden white. 
          A paralyzing excess of focus, and you know you'll never marry.</b> <i></i></div> 
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><em>I want to write about the humor, sense of playfulness, 
        openness and experimentation in Rosmarie Waldrop’s work. I want to write 
        about her signature use of the fragmented “I” which gives me the sense 
        that I am standing inside the words themselves. It is clear to me as I 
        think of these things that “what” I “think” of Rosmarie Waldrop’s work 
        is not a “what” or a “process of thinking” at all. I am made increasingly 
        aware of how the gaps in Rosmarie Waldrop’s descriptions seem to hover 
        over some unnamed edge which forces me to stop thinking for seconds at 
        a time and brings a sense of wholeness in the reading itself. I sit down 
        and try to describe this. At turns I feel I am getting too analytical, 
        then too intellectual, then it seems I am becoming too mystical, too abstract, 
        and then, in the end, too ridiculous.</em></p>

      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I map out the linear arguments I have invented 
        for myself. I try to stay within the margins I have created. I feel stressed 
        by the need for logic and intellectual epiphanies. The magic of poetry 
        leaves me. </i></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Certainly so cold in the knees the words faint, 
          amputated. The wood dries, the door starts creaking, the darkroom is 
          opened too soon. It is the lowest point gathers. A host on the tip of 
          the tongue equals worse than any pied piper.</b> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I argue with myself. My focus keeps getting narrowed. 
        My arguments feel artificial, disrespectful in their assumptions. I feel 
        I am a fraud. Rosmarie Waldrop’s work itself is other than all of my accumulated 
        descriptions. Her writing is a teetering between inside and outside, between 
        comprehension and mystery. I put everything aside hoping I will find clarity 
        when I return to this project in a week or so.</i> </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The house as if you could draw your character 
          from it, incest of immobility and sedentary adventure, breath sealed 
          by sediment of ghosts. So inferred, daylight trickles from a high window 
          the larger the absence of puddles on the floor.</b> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>I re-read my notes on Rosmarie Waldrop’s work. 
        I see that while she offers possibility, I offer conjecture. I realize 
        everything I have written is about “me” defending my invented position. 
        I cannot do this. What I love about Rosmarie Waldrop’s work is that she 
        allows misunderstanding, she offers herself the freedom for that. </i></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>The eye both hungry and </b></p>
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>begins to weep </b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><i>In consistencies in every proposition. I have 
        enslaved myself because to write “about” is to limit the experience “of.” 
        By defining her work I feel I am narrowing my sense of it. Who do I think 
        I am and why would I do this? I am not an intellectual or an academic. 
        I am that nebulous, insistent thing, “a fan.”</i> </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>This wider lens restores confusion, fingerprints 
          and weeds. Relations alter. Not just the river, the bed, too, shifts. 
          Your mother takes a lover. Slow oscillation of lips, as between hide 
          and seek, magnetic and field. Speeds red without limit through tree 
          tops, leaves flowing through veins.</b> </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Hour of glass, pillar of salt. The words come 
          to their senses. It is the lowest point gathers love. Doubt, sometimes 
          called world. It spills your heart.</b> </p>
