      <div class=Section1> 
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">When I requested and received my scanner, as a 
          Christmas gift, it was mostly for this; I firmly believe public domain 
          texts should be available free on the internet. Mine is a fairly common 
          attitude among people who have used the internet for a relatively long 
          time or who use the internet a great deal. I am interested in making 
          poetry written and published before 1923 by women, especially academically 
          overlooked women, available. There are certain ramifications to this, 
          of course. While not striking a blow against global capitalism in the 
          publishing industry, I would affect, negatively as well as positively, 
          the people I wanted to help: overlooked female poets and the female 
          academics who study them.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">At the time I found the first two Lola Ridge books, 
          <i>The Ghetto </i>and<i> Sun-Up</i>, originals, I was reading from and 
          circulating a list of roughly twentieth century proto-modernist or modernist 
          female poets writing in English who seemed to be overlooked. A large 
          number of these women were from the UK diaspora. Ridge was born in Dublin, 
          Ireland, raised and first married in New Zealand, and moved to New York 
          after her divorce. My list of poets was derived from a discussion on 
          the WOMPO listserv, Kim Lyons’ Poetry Project list, the <i>HOW(ever)</i> 
          archive, the Light &amp; Dust Books online anthology, and other similar 
          sources. Many of these women published before 1923, but their works 
          were unavailable online. I have scanned and uploaded, or am in the process 
          of so doing, volumes by Marjorie Allen Seiffert, Evelyn Scott, Hazel 
          Hall, Eunice Tietjens, and Genevieve Taggard. I will probably also make 
          <i>Sour Grapes</i> and <i>Kora in Hell</i> by William Carlos Williams 
          available, and for non-poetry, Vachel Lindsay’s book on film. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">It is important to proceed rapidly: some firms 
          are making electronic copies of public domain texts available and reserving 
          “electronic copyright.” </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Negative ramifications of online publication of 
          public domain texts include possible lower distribution of in many cases 
          long-awaited collected volumes. As-yet unplanned collected books would 
          most likely continue to be unplanned, once the works begin entering 
          the public domain. If the internet becomes a library for out of print 
          texts, as I believe it should, it would have a different effect on book 
          publishing and buying, especially in the specialized arena of poetry, 
          than library availability does, because electronic copies may be assigned 
          reading in academic courses. In fact, because I teach online, this is 
          one of my motives. It simply doesn’t make sense to have my students 
          buy physical texts. Students can print electronic books at will, rather 
          than signing up to read them at the reference desk. Further, my own 
          students, who are online, would have access to this work, which is long 
          out of print. I remember my own student poverty: I never bought any 
          of the books. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Lola Ridge’s writings are scheduled to be published 
          by the University of Maine Press. The editor of this volume, <i>Collected 
          Poems: Lola Ridge</i>, Elaine Sproat, is the Ridge literary executor. 
          As an independent academic, she had also written and presented papers 
          related to her project. She also plans a biography. Her project hasn’t 
          proceeded rapidly. If establishing ownership of an overlooked writer 
          makes an academic career, here is one to be made; yet, here is one not 
          being made. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Other problems of making these volumes available 
          include distorting perceptions of these poets writings by making only 
          first books available. This concerns me a bit more than it might ordinarily 
          since, for example, I prefer the poetry in Lola Ridge’s first two published 
          books to her other work. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">I began scanning <i>The Ghetto</i>. It was difficult 
          not to correct the errata and spelling. I didn’t exercise my editorial 
          pet peeves, such as not capitalizing each line, and not capitalizing 
          the first word in each poem. But these are fairly mundane considerations. 
          What was more difficult was reading and “cleaning up” the scans. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Scanning and cleaning up the scans is a completely 
          different way to read poetry. I have typed poetry to force myself to 
          read it, written it out longhand, listened to it on books on tape, made 
          readings recordings of my own poems and myself reading other poems. 
          I recommend these sorts of chores to inclined students, especially those 
          finding poems don’t reveal themselves adequately when read silently 
          or memorized. Normally I might be more interested in things which mis-scanned 
          — examples of those include “like the eyes of corn” and “inlay babies” 
          — and things I accidentally scanned more than once, such as the page 
          beginning “Life in the cramped ova.” There was plenty of pleasure in 
          the frangible pages aside from the text. It is common to note these 
          pleasures when “running down” electronic texts. Here’s my example: someone 
          had scanned this passage in blue ink (from “The Song of Iron,” 52) I 
          wouldn’t have picked out: </p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <div class=Section1>/ x x / x x / x x / x<br>

      </blockquote>
      <div class=Section1>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">As I scanned, I became interested in my overly 
          politically correct reactions to Ridge’s glorifying all-male construction 
          crews, Brotherhood, etc., as well as out-and-out racism. The only exception 
          to common gender roles seems to be mentioning sex before marriage and 
          pink collar jobs. This in a poet praised as a leftist activist and early 
          gender heroine. As I read more, especially in <i>Sun-Up</i>, I was surprised 
          to read about a modern single mother working at home when her child 
          is small, then hiring a less-than-preferable nanny to go to work after 
          that. I was surprised because she describes the same wretched child 
          care / pink collar job situation thousands of (especially politically 
          conservative) women working in the technology industry are discovering 
          as though it were new.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">There is a mammy poem in dialect about white women 
          throwing a black infant into a bonfire during an East St. Louis race 
          riot. A critic at the time called this the only poem in the volume also 
          containing the recitative “The Ghetto” in which “Miss Lola Ridge” becomes 
          “a full poet.” It’s truly bad. The very questionable irony is undermined 
          by the baby’s parents’ depiction as drunk or missing. These flaws sit 
          alongside complex characterizations and beautiful images I had chosen 
          to attend on early readings. Some of these poems I wanted to cut or 
          supply with female pronouns, without attention to any sort of archival 
          record. </p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">After that, I began to worry about italic. Ridge 
          uses left-margin capitalization sometimes deliberately, left-margin 
          proper case sometimes deliberately, and sometimes the left margin seems 
          to reflect no poetic or editorial decision made by this poet-editor. 
          Similarly, she makes extensive use of three and four dot ellipses, but 
          does not consistently capitalize after four dot sentence-ending ellipses. 
          She uses a great deal of italic, for quotes and voices, but again, not 
          consistently. While I ignored the Project Gutenberg welcoming of editing 
          in favor of being as letter-perfect to the print edition I could be 
          as a single volunteer scanner / proofer with a jillion other tasks at 
          hand, there is a problem with .txt files. They are overly considerate 
          of below-par browsers. In other words, the .txt file, which allows no 
          italic, standard was set years ago, when most IT professionals felt 
          a hierarchy of browsers would be in use, and that everyone, at least, 
          would be able to read .txt files. This, five to ten years later, is 
          not the case: the problem is everyone has a browser, but the server 
          the Project Gutenberg files reside upon is too slow to serve them effectively 
          without either a great deal of patience and forbearance or a corporate-speed 
          TCP/IP connection. In other words, the poet’s intentions run awry the 
          “e-publisher’s” intentions because the “e-publisher” was overly solicitous 
          towards the audience, and has ignored poet’s intentions in many respects 
          in order to serve a case which is untrue about the audience. There are 
          not thousands of old 386 machines in Nepal being used to access English 
          public domain texts on the internet.</p>
        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE">Since I began this project, more and more texts 
          are being made available: H.D.’s <i>Hymen</i> is now online. Additionally, 
          unpublished US materials written before 1922 will enter the public domain 
          in 2011, a loophole which, if not closed, would make this aspect of 
          US Copyright law more liberal than that in other countries. Copyright 
          was extended by a law sponsored by Sonny Bono before his death in order 
          to protect Mickey Mouse and other works of late modernism. It is time 
          to get a fuller picture of first wave modernist women’s writing, much 
          of which was used to replace earlier genteel writing, while its authors 
          were derided as “feminus scriblerus.”</p>

        <P CLASS="DOUBLESPACE"><b>Bio:</b> Catherine Daly lives in Los Angeles. 
          Tupelo Press will publish her first book, <i>Locket</i>, in 2003; another 
          manuscript, <i>Heresy</i>, was a finalist in the 2002 National Poetry 
          Series competition. She is at work on two collections of criticism: 
          one on contemporary experimental poetry written by women and one on 
          early modernist poetry written by women.</p>
