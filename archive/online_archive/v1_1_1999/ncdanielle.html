still struggling with it &#8211; because it would be easier to       keep<br>      going with them than pick up my life where it left off &#8211;<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these months speak years &#8211; many new things &#8211; to be       completely current with<br>      present events &#8211; living the news as it happens &#8211; with no time lag &#8211; now<br>      it's difficult to become nothing but a spectator again &#8211;<br>      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what counted was the immediate &#8211; objective justification       was impossible &#8211;<br>      for what I was doing &#8211; theoretical questions useless &#8211; when I make theory<br>      for others &#8211;
