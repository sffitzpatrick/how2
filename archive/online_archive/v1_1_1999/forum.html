Other readers are invited to reply with their       written views of the announced FORUM question; those views will be considered       for publication in this section and may be e.mailed to managing editor Jo       Ann Wasserman, <a HREF="mailto:twoswirl@aol.com">twoswirl@aol.com</a>, who       will forward them to the next issue's guest editor. FORUM remarks will,       in most cases, be excerpted if included and will be chosen with an eye for       introducing new points-of-view that have not yet been expressed.<br>      <br><hr><br><br>Kathleen Fraser posed the first FORUM question: <br><br>&quot;In 1983, there was clearly a need for women poets to take responsibility for bringing attention to the neglected pursuit and development of innovative poetic practice followed in both modernist and contemporary writing by women.  HOW(ever) was born out of that need. Is a gender-specific journal, edited by women and focused on works of modernist and current innovation, still relevant? If so, why? If not, what problems do you see and what alternatives would you propose?&quot;<br><br>      Members of HOW2's Editorial Advisory Board were invited to respond electronically       to this question. The dialogue that follows is an edited selection of comments       from each of the responses, in the order received.       <hr><br><br>KORNELIA FREITAG<br><br>I think its a good idea&#8211;even given the dangers and fears of &quot;re-enforcingthe gender gap.&quot; What I find in my reading of criticism with regard to&quot;language-centered writing&quot; is still a predominance of talk about maleexperimentalists and an occasional call upon women who are then treated (a)as if not different at all from their male counterparts or (b) read in avery superficial manner as displaying traces of women's writing. &quot;A room ofone's own&quot; might still be a good starting point for an informed engagementin the structuring of the &quot;house&quot; (to stay with the metaphor) of Americanexperimental writing. What I would always stress is that&#8211;no matter what wewish and how far we have gotten in our efforts of mutual respect&#8211;genderdoes make (and will go on making) a difference. I often feel that theresentment against separate venues of women's writing is based on theassumptions that this separation is centered on the belief that women areand write NATURALLY differently from men&#8211;which, I believe is not theissue. The important issue for creating a separate forum for women'swriting is that women are CULTURALLY different&#8211;they are represented, seen,appealed to, constructed (add to this list!) differently (also and verymuch so in experimental writing). It is a cultural issue, not one dependingon the choice or treatment of women in a particular community which mightbe more or less patronizing and/or understanding. These cultural problemsconstitute a major subject of experimental women's writing (also true inthe writing of women who prefer notto be separated from their male colleagues). I think it makes sense to havepublications which concentrate on this issue in writing.<br><br><b>BIO</b>: Kornelia Freitag is an assistant professor for American literature atthe University of Potsdam, Germany. She is working on a book-length projecton U.S. Women's Experimental Poetry and Cultural Criticism.  She haspublished articles on contemporary American writing including a recentessay on Art Spiegelman's <i>MAUS</i>. <br><br><hr><br><br>CYNTHIA HOGUE<br><br>      Freitag makes a good point that I too find gets easily overlooked, or forgotten.       That is about the cultural positioning of women, the difference in their       positioning&#8211;even their socialization. Too often, when I hear arguments       that we've gotten beyond gendered issues, or that attention to gender widens       the gender gap, it seems simply an elegant way of eluding the issues altogether.       But I also don't think it should be forgotten that the &quot;moment&quot; in which       HOW(ever) came of age was a moment dominated (at least in feminist circles)       by the consolidation of all women into that symbolic category of (white)       woman. One of the aspects that makes HOW2 most appealing is that it would       have the chance to be a forum for and of differences&#8211;the ways women variously       culturally positioned enact or inscribe difference(s). If it seems to white       women that white men still dominate the discourse, I cannot help but think       that it seems to women of color and lesbians that white, heterosexual women       still dominate feminist venues. We need an active forum to build more dialogue       among us all, to extend the thinking of the past two decades. Re: a room       of one's own: why not rooms of our own among other rooms? Rooms have doors.       Why should anyone suppose our rooms' doors are closed rather than opened,       with concourse and discourse expanding between the rooms? We can see this       project as part of the house (so to speak) of &quot;poetry.&quot; <br>      <br><b>BIO</b>: Cynthia Hogue teaches modern American literature at BucknellUniversity and directs The Stadler Poetry Center.  Her recently publishedbook, <i>SCHEMING WOMEN</i>, is reviewed in this issue.<br><br><hr><br><br>HANNAH MOCKEL-RIEKE<br><br>      First of all, I would like to say that one of my major motivations in supporting       a gender specific magazine for experimental writing is that HOW(ever) was       such an important and interesting project, and I would simply love to fuel       energy into its electronic revival. <br>      <br>To create a magazine for experimental writing by women (mostly for womenalso?) is a political rather than an aesthetic decision that Ithink&#8211;together with Kornelia and Cynthia&#8211;is still legitimate for manyreasons. Although for many women writers associated with &quot;languagewriting,&quot; gender does seem to be an issue, their work certainly pressesmore in the direction of transgressing or questioning traditional genderstereotypes or boundaries. Of course we don't live in the seventies anymoreand we have, meanwhile, witnessed and profited from the production of acomplex body of theoretical and historiographical writing on gender issues.Nevertheless many of the most basic problems raised even by liberalfeminism in the early seventies have not been solved, and part of theculture shock for a European living in the US is realizing how fundamentalthe rupture between the sexes is in this country and how strongly and, attimes, subtly it is reinforced. Of course this permeates all kinds ofcultural institutions and certainly the publishing business.<br><br>      There are a variety of functions I can think of for HOW2. For young writers,       it could be a temporarily sheltered space, a place to learn to speak up,       a place to turn to in submitting their work, and a place to look for literary       prefigurations. For all writers involved, it could be a communicative and       a communal space, certainly also an experimental space. Publishing in a       magazine for experimental women writers creates community; even recontextualizing       one's own writing in such a context might bring out aspects previously not       emphasized. The virtual medium allows dialogicity to a very high degree,       and I would hope that contributors would attempt to make use of these possibilities       and experiment with the medium. <br>      <br>      HOW2 would also be an archival space. I was just reading what Derrida has       to say about archives and patriarchal power and that reminded me how important       it is to disturb, disperse and distribute this control. HOW(ever) has been&#8211;among       other things&#8211;a wonderful archive of women's experimental writing. <br>      <br>      <b>BIO</b>: Hannah Mockel-Rieke has taught at the Free University, Berlin       and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt. Mockel-Rieke's recent       publications include &quot;Media and Cultural Memory&quot;, Amerikastudien/American       Studien. 43.1.1998, and &quot;Entgrenztes Subjekt - Liminaler Korper: Cyborgs       und Ihre Beziehung zur Korperkultur in der amerikanischen Popularkultur       der Gegenwart&quot; in: Harald Wenzel Die Amerikanisierung des Meidenalltags.       Campus, 1998. Mockel-Rieke has translated the work of many women poets including       Rosmarie Waldrop's, <i>Die Reproduktion der Gefuhle </i>(<i>The Reproduction       of Profiles</i>) and Susan Howe's, <i>Der Prager Fenstersturz </i>(<i>The       Defenestration of Prague; Excerpts</i>). <br>      <br><hr><br><br>FRANCES PRESLEY<br><br>I would reinforce many of the comments made by Freitag, Hogue and Mockel-Rieke.Only this week in the latest issue of <i>Angel Exhaust</i>, a Britishexperimental poetry journal, there is an editorial bemoaning the lack ofwomen poets in its endeavors, and blaming it on the male bar culture.  TheInternet discussion list for British and Irish poets is also bemoaning thefact that it too is male-dominated. It often seems impossible to make anybreakthrough in these arenas, and that we have to start from somewhereelse, from a woman's room. I am currently working on an e-mailcollaboration with Elizabeth James, and like Hannah I find this virtualmedium does encourage dialogicity. As a way of overcoming geographical andeven human distances it can work better than phone or letter. I have foundthis with male poets, too, but not to the same extent.<br><br>The success of virtual collaboration has to do with a desire for dialogueand in our care for each other, which does not preclude argument! As Cynthiareminds us, our differences and degrees of oppression should not beforgotten.  I have been reading the collection of writings from <i>Tessera</i>,the Canadian journal of women's writing, as well as Ann Vickery's talk oncollaboration, and both emphasize that the differences between women shouldnot be eluded. We do need to recognize that there are many rooms that womeninhabit in the house of poetry, but we should also remember that most ofthese are in the attic or the basement.<br><br>      <b>BIO</b>: Frances Presley lives in London. Her most recent publications       are <i>Linocut</i> (Oasis, 1997) and <i>Hula Hoop</i> (Other Press, 1993).       'Private Writings' will appear shortly from Maquette. She is currently working       on a collaboration with the poet Elizabeth James. <br>      <br><hr><br><br>LINDA KINNAHAN<br><br>      When I think about the need for a gender-specific website for innovative       writing, I go back in time to my first encounter with HOW(ever) in its print       form. As a graduate student (late 80s), I discovered in this slender publication       a wealth of material on and by women and, just as significantly, I was given       important tools for thinking about and altering my reading practices. Now       in 1999, HOW2 will continue to investigate relations among gender, language,       and poetics not just as a critical exercise but as a way of understanding       how we read and what our reading practices have to do with our (diverse)       social and cultural positions, our political agencies, and our opportunities       for creative/critical intersections. <br>      <br>      Clearly, for me, the feminist work performed by HOW(ever) has been of primary       importance, both in practical and in theoretical realms. A journal focused       exclusively on women demands that we think continually about the implications       of gender in relation to publication practices, to contemporary theory,       to poetic traditions, to social history, to processes of writing and reading,       to communities of readers. An obscuring of these relations has produced,       in the past, obviously masculine-centered readings of innovative writing       in this century, whether intentionally or not. Even the inclusion of women       does not necessarily reshape the paradigms that continue to evolve in considerations       of &quot;experimental&quot;/modernist/ innovative poetries; lineages, histories, and       reading practices need to continue to be explored in ways attentive to gendered       dynamics affecting them. HOW2 can be instrumental in helping to (re)shape       both a history and a future for women's/feminist experimental writing through       encouraging new work while exploring the intellectual, poetic, and material       contexts attending the cultural labor of women writing innovatively in this       moment, in this century. <br>      <br><b>BIO</b>: Linda A. Kinnahan teaches literature and feminist studies at DuquesneUniversity in Pittsburgh where she lives with her husband and daughter. Shehas published recent articles on twentieth-century American and Britishpoets, including: Kathleen Fraser, Denise Riley, Carol Ann Duffy, WendyMulford, and Geraldine Monk.  Interested in relationships between modernistand contemporary poets, she is currently completing work on a book onwomen's experimental poetry and economics that will consider Mina Loy,Marianne Moore, and a range of recent poets.<hr><br><br>MEREDITH STRICKER<br><br>      Since the completion of HOW(ever)'s first series, gender has not ceased       to be an issue for many women writing&#8211;nor is ethnicity, sexual orientation       or economics, which will continue to be articulated differently through       what has been said or left unspoken in the past. <br>      <br>      What has shifted and what engages me at this juncture is the site of reading.       Previously, HOW(ever) was available in print, on paper, distributed by mail       to hundreds of readers. The current HOW2 exchanges will be available to       anyone on the planet who has access to the Internet and perhaps keys in       &quot;women,&quot; &quot;writing,&quot; or &quot;innovative.&quot; <br>      <br>      At the same time, since the first HOW(ever), distribution of printed matter&#8211;as       opposed to cyber texts&#8211;is imploding, gasping for air. Several independent       distributors such as Segue have folded; independent bookstores are swallowed       up like tiny minnows, and the shelf life of books themselves becomes increasingly       short. Barnes &amp; Noble is trying to buy up Ingram, the largest book distributor       in the country. Amazon.com is now as big as CBS. This paradoxical explosion       and implosion of the sites of reading is what comes to mind when I consider       the relevance of a gender specific web site. <br>      <br>What happens if increasingly diverse work by women is available, but no onecan find it?<br><br>      Current antitrust struggles between Microsoft and Netscape demonstrate that       the issue is not only who is engaged or present in the market, but who controls       or directs the finding of what is available. A navigator is required as       in the case of HOW2, one that is multiplex, interactive, acute. <br>      <br>      There is no way I can count on Microsoft or AOL to open to the sites of       new writing I need to encounter. HOW2, then, can be envisioned as a site       that confronts the chaos of free-market hyperbole&#8211;where being gender-specific       is a device that enables us to select, direct, pay attention&#8211;toward inclusion.       <br>      <br>      <b>BIO</b>: Meredith Stricker lives on the Pacific Coast near Monterey and       works in the fields of visual arts and poetry. Her new work will appear       in the Spring 99 issue of <i>Conjunctions</i> and is featured on their website.       <br>      <br><hr><br><br>MEREDITH QUARTERMAIN<br><br>The question arises, do we encourage women to clamor in the male way, inthe culture of male dominance that we are accustomed to, where shouting theloudest the oftenest obtains the most heed, or do we try to develop a styleof community and interpersonal relations different from that culture ofhierarchical dominance?<br><br>      The same dynamics that continue to keep most political representation male       and most corporate management male (among other things, general undervaluing       of care-giving and human welfare) operate in the publishing world. How many       times have you picked up a journal and found yet another male sexual fantasy       deemed ground-breaking, cutting-edge literature by the editor&#8211;fantasy that       often demeans women? Recently in Canada, an anthology, <i>The Concrete Forest</i>,       was described in the <i>Vancouver Sun</i> as getting back to the gutsy male-tough       real Canadian lingo, a clear dig at the outstanding women currently popular       in Canada's fiction scene: <br>      <br>        &quot;the sentences are blunt and quick. They use the same Dick and Jane        syntax many of us use. And if a lot of the stories contain dirtywords,  well, that's because Canadian males in particular talk like that.Yet     amazingly, talk of this kind has rarely appeared in the work of our        best-known writers. Where the speech of Canadian men should havebeen there has just been a hole. Now that hole is being filled. In theterrific prose of Michael Turner's piece from <i>Hard Core Logo</i>, theworld his rock 'n rollers inhabit becomes clear right down to its EastHastings sidewalks littered with smashed whisky bottles and soggy        pieces of hot-dogs.&quot;<br><br>This reviewer assumes there is one Canadian male voice&#8211;only one can be ontop, can be the voice of the nation and that the mere fact that womenwriters are capturing public attention means that other voices cannot havethe attention they deserve&#8211;a view that sees the world as limited and toosmall for everyone. We need forums free from this attitude.<br><br>      Any social subset may well wish to provide a forum for itself to hold conversations       between persons who are similarly situated, whose lexicons involve some       shared meaning, conversational forums that are free from dismissal by those       who are not similarly situated, but at the same time open to new languages,       open to diversity and experimentation. <br>      <br>Gradually we are seeing that masculinity is only one social orientation andmacho masculinity is only one subset of that social orientation. There aremany masculinities. There are many femininities. Each with a differentlanguage. There should be room for all of them....Those who are situated inthe feminine gender need a protected space to experiment with ways aroundthis dilemma, to discover ways toward that language of tolerance, thatallows new languages and new usages of language to develop.... providedthey are not harmful. Mainstream language usage is notpolitically neutral. It reinforces the idea of one dominating others,reinforces the idea that dominance is normal and right.<br><br>      HOW2 is a place where we can work on undoing this. <br>      <br>      <b>BIO</b>: Meredith Quartermain is the author of <i>Terms of Sale</i> (Meow,       1996) and <i>Abstract Relations</i> (Keefer Street, 1998). She lives in       Vancouver and teaches at Capilano College (<a href="mailto:mquarter@capcollege.bc.ca">mquarter@capcollege.bc.ca</a>).       <br>      <br><hr><br><br>ANN VICKERY<br><br>      The first series of HOW(ever) not only supported innovative poetry by women       but made available an informal forum for sharing news and information across       regional and national borders. Furthermore, it strove to collapse the theory/praxis       divide by encouraging a creativeness and diversity of critique. All three       areas still need to be addressed today. <br>      <br>On the first front, there have been a number of journals which have whollyor strongly represented experimental women's poetry since the demise ofHOW(ever).  Some have even featured valuable critical forums on genderissues, such as the <i>Chain</i> issue on gender and editing, and the earlier  <i>Raddle Moon</i> issues on collaboration as a feminist strategy. Yet, there isstill a need for an ongoing and sustained series of these kinds of debates.<br><br>A space is also required for more informal exchange. As Meredith Strickerpoints out, the Internet would seem, in many ways, an obvious andconvenient space. Editing such space is still a necessary task, as certaindiscussion lists have shown only too clearly how the virtual duplicates thereal in silencing rather than opening access to the marginal. There is alsothe further problem of negotiating with and convincing an institution ofthe continuing value of such a project.<br><br>On the third front, the discourse of poetry and the discourse of criticismcontinue to be divided in many recent publications. While the <i>MovingBorders</i> anthology did much in its collective presentation of Americanwomen's innovative writing practices, it is an example of how suchdivisions still structure some feminist poetic projects.<br><br>The most pressing issue is to critique what it means to be gender-specific.While I am in favor of a space devoted to women's experimental poetry, I amless easy about what other kinds of restrictions might be imposed oncontributions. Are contributors, for example, to be restricted according togender? What reasons are there for such restrictions and what limitationsdoes this then impose on how gender issues can then be approached? The samequestion arises for the structure of the editorial board. Lastly, arecontributions to be gender-specific, i.e. somehow relating specifically togender? How is this to be decided? Of course, these are all issues pressingto the definition of feminism itself. I believe it is still valuable todebatesuch basic issues.<br><br>      Kornelia Freitag rightly points out that cultural positioning through gender,       as much as other identity formations, influence who gets heard and what       gets heard and by whom. I would like to explore more contexts (and sliding       contexts) of such positioning&#8211;how exactly gender is imagined, constructed       and contested? Since the first series of HOW(ever) we have seen the arrival       of queer theory. Much of queer theory foregrounds the risk that comes in       simplifying the sex/gender system and has examined strategies of subverting       it. I hope that HOW2 might be willing to engage with the complexities this       new field offers&#8211;particularly in exploring the gender crossings practiced       by many modernist women writers and writers today. <br>      <br><b>BIO</b>: Ann Vickery lives in Sydney, Australia where she is a Research Fellowat Macquarie University.

I am a poet and care about language and poetry and women'spoetry and many other forms and configurations of discourse. I care about&quot;women's&quot; poetry in a way that seems to be special, favoritist and maybeeven elitist because women are still (despite post-feminist rhetoric)defined within patriarchy against the norm of male. This is not to make anyargument about men&#8211;all men&#8211;dominating women, or how &quot;hard&quot; a femaleacademic's life may be.  I'm not complaining about my life. I'm complainingabout what I'm reading, what I can read and what I want to read, what Ineed to read. About the readers and writers I can talk to through my ownwriting. About audience and readership; circulation and marketing;productivity and capitalism.<br><br>I'm complaining about everything, but I don't want <i>just</i> to complain&#8211;I<i>need</i> to complain: about the world and how it's run. About who's runningwhat and who's in charge of whom. About grammar and who controls it. Aboutlanguage and who is listened to. About the passive voice, and why I avoidedagency in the last sentence. I need a literary journal such as <i>HOW2</i>because <i>HOW(ever)</i> made me pause and ask questions in the first place,because I read intelligent, wonderful, thoughtful, engaged writers andtheorists who made me question hierarchies and line-breaks, the avant-gardeand pronouns. Because I still need to hear the questions. Because I am awoman about to enter the 21st century and I'm looking for literarycompanionship, rather than leadership.<br><br><b>BIO</b>: Nicole Markotic is an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgarywhere she teaches Creative Writing and Contemporary Poetry. Herpublications include a novel, <i>Yellow Pages</i> (RDC Press), and a recent bookof poetry, <i>Minotaurs &amp; Other Alphabets</i> (Wolsak &amp; Wynn).<br><br><hr><br><br>LINDA RUSSO<br><br>      I would like to address the issue of accessibility as some ^forum^ responses       have left me confused (&amp; perhaps this is just a logistical problem). Meredith       Quartermain mentions the need for a &quot;protected space to experiment with       ways around this dilemma, to discover ways toward that language of tolerance&quot;&#8211;the       &quot;behavioral goal&quot; of valencey. Meredith Stricker points out that as a result       of HOW2's cyber-situation, its gender-specifity is a &quot;device that enables       us to select, direct, pay attention&#8212;toward inclusion.&quot; To any web rover       who has the right &quot;key/words,&quot; HOW2 will reveal herself. <br>      <br>      It is with interest that I find this discourse comes back to the issue of       attractiveness and protection and at the same time visibility and accessibility.       My question is, if anyone can access HOW2, and if HOW2 is (I am making presumptions       here) on the other hand accessible as a medium (of display) only to women       contributors, is HOW2 at risk of producing so many more (attractive, yes)       objects? Of reinforcing a gender-inflected subject/object binarism? <br>      <br>      Not to suggest that I see HOW2 as potentially passive&#8211;this forum, for example,       is sustenance to me at the beginning of another semester of courses (without       a single female professor at head). I'm looking forward to HOW2 because       it is a place where women will be talking. HOW2 wouldn't be HOW2 if it didn't       follow somewhat in the steps of HOW(ever<i>)</i>. But at the same time its       contributors, like in any written forum, can only be gendered in name and       to that extent a forum that proposes to be gender-specific opens itself       up to the hacking of a female Yasusada (though maybe he was a she after       all?)&#8211;that slippery slope of gender mentioned most recently by Ann Vickery       (and her questions and comments that get at the heart of what I'm at here).       I wonder if, rather than forcing one to comply to the contortions requisite       to the positioned as feminine, HOW2 could be an interactive space&#8211;let those       who have a serious interest in interacting with this discourse do so (for       they will get in anyway by putting an &quot;a&quot; at the end of their name). <br>      <br>      Nicole Markotic notes &quot;I find myself responding to the presumed 'attack'       of HOW2 being a 'feminist' journal and what, exactly, such an accusation       <i>means</i>.&quot; I wanted to ask who exactly is presuming the/to &quot;attack&quot;?       I admit I feel the &quot;enemy&quot; to be within me. If so, such perhaps means I       wish to see a change in what a feminist &quot;space&quot; and feminist boundary-devices       might consist of. I too would like HOW2 to be a woman-centered space, but       not at the risk of saying who or what is or isn't allowed to test itself       out in the discourse of the feminine&#8211;that is, who is allowed to position       him/her/itself as &quot;feminine&quot; in a space that calls itself &quot;feminist&quot; by       contrasting itself to more masculine, more aggressive sites of interaction.       I'm sure there are few men who would be actually interested in contributing       their thoughts to HOW2, but I too wonder how many will be fearlessly or       even fearsomely willing? That, I think, is a question that a forum such       as HOW2 can confront. Confronting that question thus is tantamount to &quot;the       questioning, through poetic [&amp;/or editorial] methods, of the authoritative       structures of our society...useful to both men and women... We will       have our say, we will have our space, and we will, with our words, protect       it. But I for one never qu ite enjoyed the manners in which I have been       protected (who's the agent of that verb?) unless my physical well-being       were at stake. I urge you to consider the medium and the sort of built-in       protection and opportunities (and loopholes) it provides. <br>      <br><b>BIO</b>: Linda Russo's  poems were recently published in Potes &amp; PoetsPress New Chapbook Series.

Interest among mainstream       publications &amp; among scholars/poets toward experimental writing in general       has burgeoned amazingly in recent years&#8211;perhaps even to the point of appropriation.       But how much of the attention to recent feminist writing concerns experimental       writing? What journals represent feminist explorations of innovation in       poetry? HOW2 is very much needed and will serve a crucial function for poets       &amp; scholars and poet/scholars. <br>      <br>      To respond to Cynthia's excellent critique: if &quot;mainstream&quot; feminist thinking       has been revolutionized by the on-going need to conceptualize difference,       the issue of cultural (and formal) hybridity (the mix, the &quot;mongrel&quot;), in       anti-essentialist terms, still needs to be explored&#8211;and without fixing       narrow parameters on either &quot;theory&quot; (all approaches imply a &quot;theory&quot; or       set of assumptions) or &quot;identity&quot; (too often simplified or essentialized).       I think this area of exploration can be among HOW2's contributions&#8211;to provide       a space for questions concerning not just language and gender, but also       the workings of our hybrid selves &amp; culture. It seems to me that Ann Vickery's       astute point about exploring post-colonial perspectives also speaks to this       issue. <br>      <br><b>BIO</b>:  Elisabeth Frost lives in New York City and teaches contemporarypoetry at Fordham University.

Their FORUM question is: <br>        <br>        &quot;Thanks to the efforts of feminist poets, critics, and editors, it is         now possible to identify a discourse &#8211; both scholarly and creative &#8211;         of gender and poetics. In the 1980s, journals such as HOW(ever) put the         spotlight on these issues, particularly as related to innovative or experimental         practices and how these intersected with issues of publication, erasure,         and canon formation.</font></p>      <p><font FACE="Palatino">A decade later, we find ourselves trying to define a vocabulary for addressing         complex issues of class in the formation of an innovative poetics. As         Kathy Lou Schultz asked in her Tripwire (N.1, Fall 1998) essay, &quot;What's         a working class poetic, and where could I find one?&quot; How do we make         present the &quot;absence&quot; of class in discussions of gender and         the poetics of innovation? Where are the intersections         of race in discussions of class? How are these forces fused on CON-fused?</font></p>      <p><font face="Palatino">How do/can we picture/trace working class issues         in formally innovative ways?
