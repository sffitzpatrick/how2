Ultimately, mis </nobr><br><nobr>comprehension leads one to reassess how a text is being constructed; it brings one to a  </nobr><br><nobr>Brechtian distanciation from the text where one can then </nobr><br><nobr>rethink how meaning is being performed by language </nobr><br><nobr>and how, subsequently, </nobr><br><nobr> </nobr><br><nobr>the reading subject is also being performed by language. </nobr><br><nobr> </nobr><br><nobr>		<img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="54" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Space is something that I do not see as a neutral abstraction that is </nobr><br><nobr>&quot;a-logical&quot; and &quot;without explanation,&quot; as one critic writes of Mallarm&eacute;.

Space constructs the inside/outside </nobr><br>      <nobr> dynamic that is neither culturally un </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> iversal nor absolute. To misread a </nobr><br>      <nobr> text such as one of Cole's is to become de-centered, </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> de-stabilized, to experience a sort of violence because of it utilization       of space. To </nobr><br>      <nobr> misread is also to become dislocated in space. </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">My thesis will explore through Cole's       poetry and other primary sources the </nobr><br>      <nobr> translation of space(s). Using Henri Lefevbre's <u>The Production       of Space</u> and Teresa de </nobr><br>      <nobr> Lauretis's <u>Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, and Cinema</u>,       among other texts, I will stage </nobr><br>      <nobr> the conflict between the homogenous representational space of ideology       (Lefevbre) and the </nobr><br>      <nobr> heterogenous spaces that are unaccounted for by ideology (de Lauretis)       and how this </nobr><br>      <nobr> conflict is manifest in Cole's poetry. It is this moment of conflict       that is pertinent to the </nobr><br>      <nobr> phenomenon of misreading. What misreading implies is that a reading       subject is </nobr><br>      <nobr> experiencing a mis-identification with what is being read, either       because s-he as a reading </nobr><br>      <nobr> subject is not written into the text or because the text purposely       writes its own misreading. In </nobr><br>      <nobr> this sense, the position of mis-identification can be one of empowerment,       especially where </nobr><br>      <nobr> ideology is concerned. Mis-identification reveals the presence of       a dialogic, an active almost </nobr><br>      <nobr> aggressive interaction between a reader and a text, in which the       result, as Judith Butler </nobr><br>      <nobr> writes in &quot;Sex/Gender/Desire,&quot; &quot;may entail acceptance of divergence,       breakage, splinter, </nobr><br>      <nobr> and fragmentation&quot;(14-5). </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">In <u>The Production of Space</u>, Henri       Lefevbre shows how space is a production of </nobr><br>      <nobr> ideology, how the very basic and often times unacknowledged factor       of space, that in which </nobr><br>      <nobr> we live (absolute space) and that in which we think (abstract space),       is a pervasive and </nobr><br>      <nobr> powerful structuring force. However, he also points out that space       is not homogenous, </nobr><br>      <nobr> meaning, we do not all live and experience our spaces in the same       way, but that space is </nobr><br>      represented as homogenous. Similarly, in <u>Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics,       and <br>      Cinema</u>, Teresa de Lauretis argues that &quot;semantic fields&quot; or &quot;non-linear       semantic spaces&quot; <br>      <nobr> are not constructed by a one system language but &quot;by the multilevel       interactions of many </nobr><br>      <nobr> heterogeneous sign-vehicles and cultural units&quot;(35). This is to say       that language and space </nobr><br>      <nobr> are neither universal nor linear, although they both are represented       as such by ideology. </nobr><br>      <nobr> The crucial factor that is often unacknowledged by ideology is that       identity, unlike its </nobr><br>      <nobr> representations of homogeneous space, is not a stable or conclusive       unit. On the contrary, </nobr><br>      <nobr> identity is replete with often times contradictory elements that       can neither be totally </nobr><br>      <nobr> fulfilled nor completely accounted for. In other words, the moment       of conflict that I have </nobr><br>      <nobr> described as instigating a subject's mis-identification also includes       the conflict between </nobr><br>      <nobr> his/her social and personal histories. </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> It is in this sense that I would like to examine how space, both       the spaces </nobr><br>      <nobr> within and outside of the text, function in Cole's poetry. I will       explore the cinematic, </nobr><br>      the poetic...[and finish with a discussion of the ever more pertinent topic       of cyberspace--<i>not <br>      included here</i>.

Eventually, I found that I could locate </nobr><br>      <nobr> it in many spaces. Although not all of them &quot;literary,&quot; I have </nobr><br>      <nobr> found it crucial to branch out into other disciplines such </nobr><br>      <nobr> as architecture and film in order to effectively create the </nobr><br>      <nobr> foundation for an analysis of Cole's poetry. As a </nobr><br>      <nobr> Comparative Literature thesis, this work seeks to explore </nobr><br>      <nobr> the relationships that exist between disciplines and by </nobr><br>      <nobr> doing so argue that the finite distinction between them is no </nobr><br>      <nobr> longer relevant. (I do not mean to imply that the disciplines are       </nobr><br>      <nobr> irrelevant, but that the boundaries separating them are). Architectural       </nobr><br>      <nobr> theory may be just as appropriate for a discussion of </nobr><br>      <nobr> poetry as one of poetry may be for architecture. In the </nobr><br>      <nobr> introduction of his book, <u>Architecture and Disjunction</u>, Bernard       </nobr><br>      <nobr> Tschumi argues that his use of theory from disciplines </nobr><br>      <nobr> such as film and literature in his discussions about architecture       </nobr><br>      <nobr> is necessitated by the fact that any cause-and-effect </nobr><br>      <nobr> relationship between form, use function, and socio-economic </nobr><br>      <nobr> structure has become both impossible and obsolete (4). This </nobr><br>      <nobr> phenomenon can be said to be the result of a postmodern </nobr><br>      <nobr> culture that perhaps is best characterized as a culture </nobr><br>      <nobr> of representation in which &quot;authenticity&quot; has been supplanted </nobr><br>      <nobr> by the simulacrum. Despite the array of definitions, (or non-definitions),       </nobr><br>      <nobr> that surround Postmodernism, it, as a theory of culture that includes       </nobr><br>      <nobr> theories of the media, cyberspace or otherwise, foregrounds </nobr><br>      <nobr> the importance of the visual for late twentieth century Western European       </nobr><br>      <nobr> culture. What the numerous arguments surrounding Postmodernisms </nobr><br>      <nobr> show is how much this period is concerned with </nobr><br>      <nobr> crisis, whether it be the crisis of the subject, the crisis </nobr><br>      <nobr> of meaning, the crisis of captialism, of authority, etc. In the late       </nobr><br>      <nobr> twentieth century, nothing seems to be real, everything </nobr><br>      <nobr> is a simulation of difference, an image of an image. </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">According to Lefevbre, the visual is       that which </nobr><br>      <nobr> represents: &quot;in space, things, acts, situations are forever </nobr><br>      <nobr> being replaced by representations. The Ego no longer relates </nobr><br>      <nobr> to its own nature but only to things bound to their own signs </nobr><br>      <nobr> and indeed ousted and supplanted by them&quot; (311). </nobr><br>      <nobr> The visual, the fragmentation or dissolution of boundaries </nobr><br>      <nobr> between various genres and the crisis of the subject are </nobr><br>      <nobr> all very pertinent to not only Cole's poetry, but to my </nobr><br>      <nobr> discussion of it. Writing about writing, about poetry, is as </nobr><br>      <nobr> much about the poetry as it is about the writing itself. The goal       </nobr><br>      <nobr> of my thesis is not only to analyse and interpret Cole's poetry,       but </nobr><br>      <nobr> also to explore what it means for me to write about it. In </nobr><br>      <nobr> <u>Woman Native Other</u>, Trinh Min-ha states that &quot;to write is       to </nobr><br>      <nobr> become. Not to become a writer (or a poet), but to become, </nobr><br>      <nobr> intransitively&quot;(19). The idea that writing is intransiate, </nobr><br>      <nobr> is constantly in the process of becoming, is something that is </nobr><br>      <nobr> integral to Cole's poetry and to my understanding of it. To conceive       of </nobr><br>      <nobr> writing as process, as a continually forming and reforming act without       </nobr><br>      <nobr> conclusion is to not only recognize the inconclusiveness of language,       </nobr><br>      <nobr> but also to recognize that this inconclusiveness contributes to the       argument </nobr><br>      <nobr> that there is no one language through which meaning is conveyed.       </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">It is significant that both Roland Barthes       and </nobr><br>      <nobr> Jacques Derrida have focused on the crisis of criticism when </nobr><br>      <nobr> confronted with avantgarde or difficult writings. In <u>S/Z</u>,       Barthes </nobr><br>      <nobr> writes that &quot;to interpret a text is not to give it a meaning, but       </nobr><br>      <nobr> on the contrary to appreciate what plurality constitutes it&quot;(5).       </nobr><br>      <nobr> However, Barthes also writes that the work of the </nobr><br>      <nobr> commentary, once it is separated from any ideology of </nobr><br>      <nobr> totality, consists precisely in &quot;manhandling the text, </nobr><br>      <nobr> interrupting it&quot;(15). This manhandling is precisely what </nobr><br>      <nobr> I will inevitably do. Nevertheless, I do not necessarily </nobr><br>      <nobr> agree with Barthes's description of manipulating a text, </nobr><br>      <nobr> because it does not acknowledge the general crisis of criticism </nobr><br>      <nobr> that difficult writing inspires. For his part, Derrida, explains       </nobr><br>      <nobr> that for rhetoric or criticism to have something to do before a text,       </nobr><br>      <nobr> a meaning has to be determinable (114). However, in referring </nobr><br>      <nobr> to Mallarm&eacute;'s writing, Derrida illustrates that when a simple       </nobr><br>      <nobr> decision is no longer possible for the critic or the reader, the       choice </nobr><br>      <nobr> between opposing paths is suspended. This suspension instigates a       crisis </nobr><br>      <nobr> of criticism that obstructs the critic's ability to decide on a meaning.       </nobr><br>      <nobr> As for my thesis, the non-traditional handling of a poet and </nobr><br>      <nobr> her poetry is all perhaps in recognition of the crisis of criticism       and </nobr><br>      <nobr> the intransience of writing, both of which are essential components       </nobr><br>      <nobr> of Cole's poetry and of the act of reading and writing about it.       </nobr><br>      <nobr>       <hr>      </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"> In creating a visual poetry, (a poetry       that utilizes movement much like cinematic </nobr><br>      <nobr> images do, which through their movement on the screen, create a narrative,       or, in some </nobr><br>      <nobr> cases, a non-narrative), the way in which the words function upon       the blank space of the </nobr><br>      <nobr> page becomes essential. In <i>Memory Shack</i>, a poem from <u>Moira</u>,       Cole cites the reader as a </nobr><br>      <nobr> spectator: &quot;a string shadow or space / the spectator is alive / as       a messy site&quot; (20). Words </nobr><br>      <nobr> understood visually on the page can become much more then signifiers       that are locked </nobr><br>      <nobr> onto a specific manner of signification, but they can, like images,       move on the page creating </nobr><br>      <nobr> multiple readings, readings that are both visual and connotative.       In his essay on Mallarm&eacute;, </nobr><br>      <nobr> Derrida describes this phenomenon as <i>&eacute;criture</i>: </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&quot;the marks and white spaces on the page       [which] are only one realization of the articulations and </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">systems of difference upon which the       operations of significations rely and which prevent signification </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">from ever closing on itself or on the       world.&quot; (7) </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> &#201;criture is language that understands or includes the spaces       that already exist in language; </nobr><br>      <nobr> &#201;criture is about writing the spaces back into language, exposing       the systems of difference </nobr><br>      <nobr> that make up language. However, unlike images, words are classically       understood to </nobr><br>      <nobr> function not in a pictoral or visual manner, but in a stricly signifying       sense. Words are, in a </nobr><br>      <nobr> way, locked into the manner in which they are supposed to be read.       In a fax that I received </nobr><br>      <nobr> from Norma Cole, where she refers to her recent struggle with an       editor concerning the </nobr><br>      <nobr> layout of some of her poetry, she writes: </nobr><br>      <br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The titles of these poems are sometimes       onomastic in their function, sometimes like introductory or </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">prestanzic, or, in some cases, want to       be read into the first lines of the text, as text.

A poetry that is visual, that is exploring the visual       and seeking to create the </nobr><br>      <nobr> space for other reading experiences, becomes a poetry that feels       &quot;cinematic&quot; </nobr><br>      <nobr> &quot;architectural,&quot;or &quot;textural.&quot; It also becomes a poetry that can       no longer be read as </nobr><br>      <nobr> &quot;poetry;&quot; it becomes a poetry that entices misreadings, that runs       over the poetic parameters </nobr><br>      <nobr> of stanza, verse, rhyme and rather then evoke readings, evokes experiences       of readings. </nobr><br>      <nobr> The poetry becomes writerly rather than readerly, to use Roland Barthes's       distinction. </nobr><br>      <nobr>       <hr>      </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Misreadings, in their renaming or re-experiencing       of images or words, can ostensibly </nobr><br>      <nobr> create the space(s) in which seemingly homogenous meaning and experience       can radically </nobr><br>      <nobr> be undermined. Misreading can bring to the surface differences that       are hidden by ideology </nobr><br>      <nobr> and consequently underscore transparency as the artifice that it       is. It is my argument that </nobr><br>      <nobr> radical poetry such as Cole's constitutes a remapping of meaning       as plural and </nobr><br>      <nobr> inconclusive, as open and therefore always subject to change, as       above all heterogeneous. </nobr><br>      <nobr> However, this remapping entails a certain condition of being lost,       of accepting the horror of </nobr><br>      <nobr> being lost. Really, it entails nothing other than what is already       there. But to foreground it, </nobr><br>      <nobr> to make this the ground from which to work, is to not only defy certain       standards of </nobr><br>      <nobr> readability, it is to create a space of destitution with which the       reader and writer are </nobr><br>      <nobr> confronted. The reader can no longer be a passive spectator expecting       a condition of </nobr><br>      <nobr> meaning that is predetermined and hence readable, but the reader       must learn to reread the </nobr><br>      <nobr> spaces in which meaning is formed and therefore reread new spaces       in which new forms </nobr><br>      <nobr> and or meanings can be created. The reader must examine the power       relations that make </nobr><br>      <nobr> certain dialogics possible and perhaps question these dialogics in       the hopes for new ones. </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr>       <hr>      </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> Poetic Space: Paper House</nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="90" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">&quot;moving about in worlds not realized&quot;</nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="216" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">- Norma Cole <i>Paper House </i></nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> Paper House - space of violence, space of destitution. House of a       book made of paper, paper </nobr><br>      <nobr> housing spaces, spaces inhabiting the house of paper. Paper House       a space of fraility where </nobr><br>      <nobr> the structures are showing through the decor. The House threatens       to fall, to cease being </nobr><br>      <nobr> the protective structure that it is desired to be. A House is a space       of shelter, one that like </nobr><br>      <nobr> the apparatus seeks to veil all signs of turmoil from both the inside       and the outside. Once </nobr><br>      <nobr> the structures are bare then the inside and outside are no longer       protected from each other. </nobr><br>      <nobr> The outside can see in and the inside can see out but be seen by       the outside seeing. A Paper </nobr><br>      <nobr> House is one that does not promise shelter. It promises transparency,       not the transparency </nobr><br>      <nobr> of meaning, but the transparency of structure. The apparatus is thus       seen as structure that is </nobr><br>      <nobr> structuring the internal and external spaces. The idea of the Paper       House indicates the </nobr><br>      <nobr> importance of the boundaries that separate the inside from the outside.       This distinction is </nobr><br>      <nobr> one of the fundamental bases for our understanding of our world;       it allows us private and </nobr><br>      <nobr> public space divisions. It attributes to our understanding of our       bodies and their relation to </nobr><br>      <nobr> the space that they inhabit and are subsequently framed by. If this       division is weakened </nobr><br>      <nobr> then bodies are exposed, violence is exposed, the boundary between       private and public </nobr><br>      <nobr> space is eradicated. </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The notion of the House functions on       various levels in Cole's poem. It is that in </nobr><br>      <nobr> which we live and that with which we speak. It is a structure, symbolic       of the apparatus of </nobr><br>      <nobr> language, symbolic of the nation. The House structures us, it defines       our notions of the </nobr><br>      <nobr> spaces in which we live. In <u>The Politics of Poetic Form</u>, Bruce       Andrews writes that political </nobr><br>      <nobr> or &quot;radical&quot; writing &quot;reads the outside, it doesn't just read itself&quot;       (24). In many ways, the </nobr><br>      <nobr> House is the boundary marker between inside and outside space or       between private and </nobr><br>      <nobr> public space. A Paper House is a visual manifestation of language.       It is the walls, the floor, </nobr><br>      <nobr> the doors that we shut, for without language they all disappear.       The House reveals the </nobr><br>      <nobr> architectural importance of space and of language. It is a rudimentary       structure like that of </nobr><br>      <nobr> the alphabet which structures Cole's poem. The House reads the outside       because it defines </nobr><br>      <nobr> it. Similarly, Cole's poem reads the outside because it reveals it.       </nobr><br>      <nobr> </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The form of <i>Paper House</i> incites       many issues concerning the structure of language in </nobr><br>      <nobr> poetry. There is indeed a poetic architecture that constructs how       a poem can be read. Be it </nobr><br>      <nobr> stanza, verse, fragmentary form, the architecture of words builds       the walls of the poem, or, </nobr><br>      <nobr> in this case, takes those walls apart. Cole's poem is divided into       twenty five small poems, </nobr><br>      <nobr> one for each letter of the alphabet except for y and z. Almost instinctively,       one looks for the </nobr><br>      <nobr> logical correspondance between each letter and its poem finding that       the connection, if </nobr><br>      <nobr> there is one, is not obvious, perhaps is not even there. Under the       seemingly elemental </nobr><br>      <nobr> structure of language, the alphabet, there lies a heavy and complex       network of signs and </nobr><br>      <nobr> meanings that pull with it numerous histories of memory, experience       and violence. That </nobr><br>      <nobr> the poetry consists of the same letters as the simply laid out alphabet       reveals the inherent </nobr><br>      <nobr> inconsistencies within language. Which is to say that the process       by which meaning is </nobr><br>      <nobr> conveyed and constructed is neither linear or clearly maintained:       there is always a certain </nobr><br>      <nobr> violence inherent to the act.

To a certain degree, it is easy to throw       around theories about </nobr><br>      <nobr> gender, the crisis of meaning, the crisis of the subject and so forth,       without recognizing the </nobr><br>      <nobr> important role that theory, art, literature, poetry, architecture,       etc., play in actively shaping </nobr><br>      <nobr> our conceptions of the spaces in which we exist and subsequently       the ways in which we </nobr><br>      <nobr> define ourselves and others. It seems like such an inconsequential       thing to write a thesis on </nobr><br>      <nobr> an avant-garde poet and admittedly it is. At least, to a certain       extent. Who reads Norma </nobr><br>      <nobr> Cole anyway? Certainly not academia. Certainly not the general public.       Whoever that is. </nobr><br>      <nobr> Her poetry is difficult. A difficulty, however, that must both be       understood in relation to its </nobr><br>      <nobr> opposite and in relation to a specific historical moment that happens       to discourage </nobr><br>      <nobr> difficulty. At least at the level of the arts. A difficultly that       must be examined in order to </nobr><br>      <nobr> ascertain why it is that it is named difficult and why it is that       clarity is important to begin </nobr><br>      <nobr> with. Clarity, as does everything, has a price and that price is       arguably paid for by those who </nobr><br>      <nobr> are excluded from the vision / representation that defines it/. </nobr><br>      <nobr> <img SRC="0.gif" HSPACE="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">I began my thesis with a simple statement:       I do not understand Norma Cole's poetry. </nobr><br>      <nobr> What this means exactly is, of course, unknowable, but what this       means for me to say it is </nobr><br>      <nobr> that I freed myself from the responsibility to have to know something       enough to write </nobr><br>      <nobr> about it. This confession has, ultimately, enabled me to write. And       as it has enabled me to </nobr><br>      <nobr> write, it has enabled me to write &quot;intransitively,&quot; as Trinh T.

To move in </nobr><br>      <nobr> different spaces and to rethink the spaces with which I thought I       was already familiar. </nobr><br>      <nobr> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       </nobr><br>      <nobr> <b>Bio</b>: Wendy Tronrud has recently finished her B.A. degree in       Comparative Literature at </nobr><br>      <nobr> Barnard College of Columbia University.
