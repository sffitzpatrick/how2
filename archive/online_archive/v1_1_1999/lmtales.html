But diverseinfluences came roiling through me in a necessarily genre-blurring workwherea reading of Bakhtin (how wrong he was about the lack of the dialogic inpoetry!) mixed with Williams'<i>Paterson</i> and James'<i>The Sacred Fount</i> andturned back towards the feminine, indeed the maternal: the books my motherandI had read together, even though in separate rooms, those piles of librarybooks knee deep by the side of each bed (the site of the guilty pleasure:reading...because it was selfish...). I speak, of course, if I speak (andstill I feel&#8211;more so than with the dirty laundry of any meredisfunctionality&#8211;guilty, when I speak) of Renault, Stewart, Whitney,Heyer:novels with thinly clad women on their well-protected dust jackets, out insome storm in the middle of the night at the base of sheer cliffs on whichacastle...&#8211;etc.. Oh yes, Radcliff, oh, yes, &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis, but I was goingbackto those modern gothics Tania Modleski differentiates from Harlequinromancesby just this much: &quot;the Harlequin heroine's feelings undergo atransformationfrom fear into love, whereas for the Gothic heroine the transformation isfromlove to fear.&quot; (<i>Loving with a Vengence</i> p.60) From love to fear and outagain, and in again and out again and whew: a familliar story. It works, asthey say, by breaking down. The failure of narrative (the narrative of thefamily just for starters) interested me, intensely, personally: I'd come topoetry as a site (articulated audibly for me first by Plath) of resistancetothe social (cultural as well as familial) narratives in which women playedsuch silent, terrified, confused and endangered roles, a site at whichLyotard's announcement of the end of the grand narratives came as a note ofhope, for it was&#8211;as I more and more realized&#8211;not my house which wascomingdown, and just might come more obviously down if I stopped participating inall the rituals that helped to prop it up. It: &quot;illusions of ordercongealedby fear&quot; (Taussig,<i>The Nervous System</i>). Well out of it for a little whileIbecame its entrance and exit, its wind tunnel, its open door: an apertureforwhat horror had, in a mutitude of tongues, to tell&#8211;and toll as stillunspeakable.<hr><h3><i>from</i> The Tales of Horror</h3><h4>by Laura  Mullen</h4><br><br><nobr>She touches me and takes her hand away abruptly, it's so clear that there is no one there.</nobr><br><nobr>&quot;But it's always been like that!&quot; Nervous laughter. The picture</nobr><br><nobr>Of a headless man falling headlong hangs at the head of the stairs.</nobr><br><nobr>&quot;Why I must have been dreaming!&quot; All this in the tone of one</nobr><br><nobr>Who desires to convince himself or herself. The maroon silk smoking jacket, the yawn,</nobr><br><nobr>The fists rubbed into the eyes. Sensuous detail is wonderful, wonderful,</nobr><br><nobr>But when the sheets twist themselves up into that slug-like form</nobr><br><nobr>In the sticky moonlight, becoming a lady who goes for the throat,</nobr><br><nobr>I check out of this hotel, apartment in a crumbling villa, mansion that no one...</nobr><br><nobr>Et cetera. &quot;I won't stay another minute, I tell you!&quot; Fireworks.</nobr><br><nobr>And if the marriage breaks up it's the fault of the house (the body</nobr><br><nobr>Goes out on a stretcher). &quot;I tell you it's the same woman after all this time!&quot;</nobr><br><nobr>There is a shocked gasp perhaps? Could you give us a, ah, yes&#8211;</nobr><br><nobr>Thought that was your tongue, no need to worry about that any longer.</nobr><br><nobr>&quot;I say old chap, it didn't seem to you, for an instant, did it, that that <i>choir</nobr><br><nobr>Of summer insects </i> was doing Verdi?&quot; &quot;On the contrary....&quot; You have to wonder</nobr><br><nobr>Why he didn't just donate the goddamned (whoops, literally) thing to a Museum.</nobr><br><nobr>He put his head in his hands. &quot;May I make a suggestion?&quot; &quot;We shall have to</nobr><br><nobr>Arm ourselves carefully for this deed!&quot; <i>And in fact he would not have lived</nobr><br><nobr>If we hadn't moved him here. </i> The thing, with a piercing shriek of unearthly laughter</nobr><br><nobr>Fled away. &quot;Why it's been 'to let' forever....&quot; You can tell that a beautiful</nobr><br><nobr>But evil woman once lived here. Well the house was thick with terror. (&quot;I say,</nobr><br><nobr>What is this goop on the stairs?&quot;) Let's have another, shall we? I don't think</nobr><br><nobr>I could bear to be left alone just yet. I don't think I can stay here.</nobr><br><nobr>These candles have a habit of going out. Ah yes, here's that little something</nobr><br><nobr>I've been telling you about. There, do you see that? And it's headed</nobr><br><nobr>In our direction. &quot;Why, I would have sworn they...no, I'd better not have another&#8211;</nobr><br><nobr>Preposterous!...that those birds and insects (in the tall grasses and green-</nobr><br><nobr>Leaved trees at the beginning of summer) were producing a most sophisticated</nobr><br><nobr>Tune.&quot; Shaking his head as if to clear it. Gentle, slightly amused</nobr><br><nobr>Laughter, &quot;in fact, I think I'll just turn in.&quot; Things are bound to look better</nobr><br><nobr>In the morning. (I believe you can shed a little light on this professor!)</nobr><br><nobr>Nothing simpler. The marks of teeth at the throat. But humming to himself</nobr><br><nobr>As he went back upstairs. Have you seen it? No, but I felt something, I distinctly</nobr><br><nobr>Felt some, as it were, breath of.... Yes, exactly: now you know I'm not mad.</nobr><br><nobr>I was just so grateful to find lodgings I could finally afford! As though her hand</nobr><br><nobr>Had frozen at the touch of my shoulder, she quickly took it&#8211;stiffened as though</nobr><br><nobr>Around an invisible...&#8211;away. Voices, voices, out of the walls</nobr><br><nobr>And the ceilings and floors. And then nothing stays where you put it.</nobr><br><nobr>&quot;Why I would'na live thar sur fra hunert pound!&quot; No Bill, nor I either&#8211;</nobr><br><nobr>This said kindly (condescendingly). &quot;Tip him,&quot; this hissed out from, no doubt,</nobr><br><nobr>The Collective Unconscious. It had an unpromising aspect, but my funds were low,</nobr><br><nobr>And I wasn't, I told myself, lifting my head, one to be easily frightened.</nobr><br><nobr>&quot;Just put those boxes down anywhere.&quot; And your name? <i>Burning eyes, eyes like.... </i> </nobr><br><nobr>Ah yes, my name. I checked the mirror quickly, expecting&#8211;I'll admit it&#8211;</nobr><br><nobr>To find only one of us there.</nobr><br><br><nobr></nobr><br><br><nobr></nobr><br><hr><b>Bio: </b> Laura Mullen is the author of <i>The Surface</i> (U.
