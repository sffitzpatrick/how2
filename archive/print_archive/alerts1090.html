The structure of the sonnet, for instance, is a way of organizing, channeling, and making familiar, a way of teaching us how to cope with the processes of consciousness that our changing culture forces on us, the realigning patterns of the psyche. . .<p align="justify">I have been in my brain when it was a thing of total fear, and come out to write, clutching like a half-drowned woman, a sonnet with the wistful closure or the triumphant one not at the end, but in the middle. And then looked back on my former poems and saw that they could be that way too, that they had a pattern in them. . . that might be called a female pattern, based not on seeking but surrounding. And it made me reinterpret the male tradition of the sonnet as a love by the one, the signing ego, for the flat, unrepresentational, the multi-perspectival anima. . . All paralleling the coming of women into their own, the making conscious of the women who were repressed. . .</p><p align="justify">Maybe the fear of these engines that surround us has only been fear at repressing my (our?) own writing efficiency, technology during this long search for a form. . . a sonnet-trophy, which could help women build our consciousness alive and our dreams real as the old sonnet helped the men to do. Our sonnet seems different; it has a small i in it instead of a big one. But perhaps any sonnet at all is a big i. That's something I have to fear. . .</p><p align="justify">How can anyone hear me if I write so fast that only the journal form will do, if I have so many ideas that they keep pace with life and then I dissolve?. . . Don't play with me cause you're playing with fire. The animus is fire. Peewee Herman running out of the petshop holding snakes like a cretan goddess. The anima is water, but the animus is fire. That's the volcano Pele and electronic technology. And now it will be under control, and as Jesse said on the radio today the desert will bloom. . .</p><p align="justify">--can I do anything to this fire? or just trust it, since I am the small i, the clitoris, and it is the big I, in this i am bic pen driven to meter world now?. . .</p><p align="justify">The more you write the more you write this way. </p><p align="justify">The more you write this way the less you write??</p><p align="justify">Maybe I will just let it carry me along the waves of life.</p><p align="justify">Will that make it blow me up in a nuclear blast?</p><p align="justify">Fear of the fire has made that a problem.</p><p align="justify">Maybe if women can ride the fire, call it our animus and ride it with its big romantic I, just get on top of it and ride along, it won't be so awful any more.</p><p align="left"><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Annie Finch</i></p><p align="justify"><br>Annie Finch is finishing a study of &quot;The Metrical Code and the Fate of Iambic Pentameter in American Poetry&quot; for her PhD at Stanford. Her poems, essays and reviews appear in many journals. Her first book of poems, &quot;From the Menstrual Hut&quot;, is in circulation.

This conference focused on the writing of the last twenty years by Québécoise poets, novelists, and playwrights. </div><p align="justify">A rebel (masculinized in English) is one who refuses allegiance to an established government, party, law -- the mainstream, in short, yet rebels have their own allegiance to each other and just because this allegiance is to something other than the accepted, it can be erased in the dictionary definition. The question of allegiance or loyalty or even comradeship (frustration that these words, so heavily freighted with patriarchal values, seem to have no cognates in the feminine): all right, to re-word, this question of connectedness, of for whom, with whom am i writing, has been very important to me as a woman writer.</p><p align="justify">With her coining of &quot;re-belle&quot;, Susanne de-Lotbinière Harwood has retrieved &quot;rebel&quot; for women's use by turning the word from its war-oriented root to a revisioning of beauty. This seems to me to have an important connection with my answer to the question of for whom, with whom do i write. . . .</p><p align="justify">Feminist critical theory has amassed pages on why women find hybrid forms, nonlinear structures, a processual and fragmentary approach most adaptable to our sense of the real (and this includes our imaginary). It wasn't till i started reading feminist literary criticism that i understood why these structures and techniques were so adaptable to what i have to say as a woman and as a lesbian writer. Coincident with this awareness came an extraordinarily vivid sense of audience, and this is where Susanne's &quot;re-belle&quot; becomes important.</p><p align="justify">As i continued reading my work to live audiences, as that almost tactile sense of an audience being <i> with    </i> the work began to be apparent, as woman after woman came up afterwards with the excitement of having heard verbalized some perception that confirmed her own silent one, or elicited some making sense of her own mutedly different experience, i began to be aware of an unspeakable beauty in women. Not just the unspeakable beauty of our bodies that don't conform to standard sexist notions of female beauty, and not just the beautiful strength of women freed from the confines of suitably &quot;feminine&quot; (read repressed) behavior, but the unspeakable beauty of our coming into words, the words that struggle to convey what language cannot, without subversion, confirm: the affirmation of our embodied and multiphasic being <i> from where we stand,  </i> aside, astride so many versions of difference, from where we stand, in resistance to so much on all sides, everything has to be re-envisioned. That is the beauty and the terror of the place from which we speak. . . .</p><p align="justify">Perhaps what i'm trying to articulate here is the beginning of a lesbian theory of writing, but i know that it also embraces women who are not lesbian, as the result, it may be, of what Luce Irigaray calls our &quot;plural&quot; sexuality. I know that it also embraces our connectedness to what surrounds us, the matter, the matrix of our shared lives, our ecosphere, the very &quot;ground&quot; we stand on and with. . . .Louky Bersianik speaks of Virginia Woolf as her literary mother and it seems to me that as women writing now, our work goes on mothering each other in continuously generative circuits of thought, both within French and within English as two distinct cultures waving to each other across the language divide, and as common ground differently arrived at. . .</p><p><i><img src="../Images/spacer.gif" width="25" height="10">--Daphne Marlatt</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">Daphne Marlatt's most recent publications are a novel,        <i> Ana Historic        </i>  (Coach House, 1988), and a poetic collaboration with Betsy Warland,        <i> Double Negative        </i>  (Gynergy, 1988).
