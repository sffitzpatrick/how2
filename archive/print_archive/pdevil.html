<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15"><font FACE="Palatino">What the girl saw was an excavation of the site of the feminine in the black hanging

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">down. It permitted insight and concealed. It took on a feminine history that begins with

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">the particular and goes back to beginnings. Like any object a woman has touched:

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">needle, cup, iron.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Notepaper, carpet, field. An excavation, a surface suddenly lost. What then? There's

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">more than appears in a chair! Wood, batting, thread, springs.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Overwhelmed, she avoided her mother's room. If she went in--she had to--she looked

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">straight ahead and made up surfaces: white, smooth. A bathroom.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Horses, a tree. She didn't look at her mother or think &quot;mother,&quot; &quot;woman,&quot; and stopped

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">anyone who said words that were about her: &quot;Silver.&quot; Sshh.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">She banged her shovel. She stuck to it like a soldier to his gun. Excavate. Sshh.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The face in the veil was indistinct. Kind. The air sighed. It moaned the moans of gener-

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">ations. Women's and children's eyes were clear. Their noses indistinct. Their mouths a

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">series of coverings and uncoverings that filled with earth and emptied themselves in

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">words. &quot;Good .&quot; &quot;Work.&quot;

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Here was an opportunity. But there was too much to go through. More than a simple

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">door. The key was caught in the veil. In generations of feminine history, in the net, a

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">tree. Things. The richness was overwhelming. There was too much time.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Boredom took her by the throat. There was no time for mercy.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Damn, she should have killed him with the scissors, gone to the spot in his back when

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">he was bending over to wind the dock.
 <i> She
</i>  could have rid their days of him and made

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">it a safer world for generations of women and children crying to be free of the prison of

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">his body, all waving guns.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Poor girl. Lost. Poor mother. Stop.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Sshh. &quot;I don't think of my mother. There'll be no more house, or things that open. They

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">will be opened, without more 'in' or 'out' or traps.&quot;

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Any word was a trap. &quot;Late.&quot; &quot;Early.&quot; Sshh.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">She'd come in in the middle, she thought. She'd planned to stay on top and not disap-

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">pear. But she'd been caught on the corner of the walk to the front door of her own house.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">On a path she herself had cleared, the shovel in her hand part of her shadow.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">And her mother was receding, her face a veil over something that was sweet and vague.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">And whole and sticky in the girl's mind as a candy apple at the county fair, where skin

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">had been a temptation behind a tent flap. She'd heard sighs and had fallen asleep,

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">her cheek on the canvas in the lights of the ferris wheel.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Love takes a woman's skin. It lifts her flesh and takes it from her. Stop. Don't look.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">The girl stood with her eyes ahead. She developed a glance that stopped her mother

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">cold and anyone who was the girl's friend necessarily ignored. And her father sent her

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">upstairs for and told her to close her door.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">She let herself be touched. She couldn't be alone. Stop. Sshh. She touched, because she

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">couldn't help notice things were lovely. She reached out.

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">
<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Into the thing. She was touched where there was no surface. Where she opened, she

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">Didn't stop. No matter which way she turned her hand was out. A painter's brush drip-

<br><img src="0.gif" hspace="20" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="15">ping with pigment. Color. Sshh.
