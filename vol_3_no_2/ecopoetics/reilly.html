          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="poem"><p>The site of the human soul someone says</p>
          <p>A so-called “weak” bond </p>
          <p>The hydrologic cycle and its proponents the lakes</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbon of course the world</p>
          <p>Children play in the contaminated river</p>
          <p>Pluck a doll from the sediments</p>
          <p>The cataract is named for an Indian Maiden </p>
          <p>Weeping of course</p>
          <p>The word <em>cataract</em> </p>
          <p>The word <em>maiden</em></p>
          <p>Water breaks</p>
          <p>The doll seemingly menstruates</p>
          <p>Between yes and no answers the witness stutters</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbons make things better</p>
          <p>The doll dangles from the child’s wrist</p>
          <p>Nature is a scene by Casper David Friedrich</p>
          <p>It points to a place beyond peaks and pinnacles</p>
          <p>And seems to redeem the general pillage</p>
          <p>But children circle the garbage piles </p>
          <p>And subject to cycles the world is volatile </p>
          <p>The cycle of violence is a manner of speaking</p>
          <p>Speaking is part of the energy circulating</p>
          <p>The cycle of violence is a classical painting </p>
          <p>Called <em>Rape of the Sabines </em></p>
          <p>Aesthetics are part of it</p>
          <p>Bacteria are part of the community of individuals </p>
          <p>They digest the carpet of effluents </p>
          <p>But the pond is emptied by speculating builders</p>
          <p>They make another one</p>
          <p>Add swans to it</p>
          <p>Now rage is a Romantic picture</p>
          <p>Named <em>Weeping Indian Maiden</em></p>
          <p>The weak bond is a source of tension</p>
          <p>Between settlers and natives</p>
          <p>Between natives and immigrants</p>
          <p>The word <em>settler</em></p>
          <p>The word <em>native</em></p>
          <p>The word <em>immigrant</em></p>
          <p>The word tension is a euphemism</p>
          <p>The doll is a tool of self-invention</p>
          <p>In a game called reality television</p>
          <p>The children pretend she has skills in business and fashion</p>
          <p>You’re fired! she says to the filthy children</p>
          <p>You’re filthy! they say to the doll leaking effluents</p>
          <p>Vegetation climbs up over the precipice</p>
          <p>As planes touch down on the landing strip</p>
          <p>Friction is a exchange of energy and tarmac </p>
          <p>Gender is a doll discovered by children </p>
          <p>Logic is a certain kind of sentence</p>
          <p>It comes to the aid of the jurors </p>
          <p>Their so-called weak bond</p>
          <p>They hand the sentence to the subject</p>
          <p>They subject the subject to time</p>
          <p>The subject is treated like an object </p>
          <p>The sentence is said to be “life”</p>
          <p>And no one has objected</p>
          <p>But now the doll is examining the evidence</p>
          <p>The grammar gets very bottom line</p>
          <p>Still the price of menstruating dolls is doing fine </p>
          <p>It is the right place and the right time</p>
          <p>Although the weak bond continues to create surface tension </p>
          <p>Bugs walk on it</p>
          <p>Lay some eggs</p>
          <p>The menstruating doll widens her stance </p>
          <p>She contemplates the falling of eggs</p>
          <p>When she was younger her legs couldn’t be separated </p>
          <p>She had to move in a straight line</p>
          <p>Then changed </p>
          <p>Bugs walk across the earth’s surface </p>
          <p>Carbon is locked in it</p>
          <p>Carbon is waiting to be released from its locked condition</p>
          <p>The waiting has been carboniferous </p>
          <p>The earth is a ball of resources</p>
          <p>The doll is a hydrocarbon with a bikini wax</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbons were once crinoids and club mosses</p>
          <p>The children pluck another doll from the river’s garbage </p>
          <p>He skates on the surface tension </p>
          <p>Bugs skate with him</p>
          <p>The air sings of effluents </p>
          <p>This doll’s knees once couldn’t bend</p>
          <p>Then changed </p>
          <p>Now he can be made to kneel before the mountain of garbage</p>
          <p>Bugs decompose only part of it</p>
          <p>The effluent is carbon and the garbage is home</p>
          <p>It took eons for the evolution of the amnion </p>
          <p>Harmony is a dream of a world without tension</p>
          <p>Tension is a state of competing interests</p>
          <p>The peaceable kingdom is a scene by Casper David Friedrich</p>
          <p>Bugs walk over it</p>
          <p>The peaceable kingdom is contaminated by interests</p>
          <p>The word interests is a euphemism</p>
          <p>Useful in the games of diplomats</p>
          <p>The diplomats gather at the cataract of The Weeping Maiden</p>
          <p>Bugs bite their arms and faces</p>
          <p>Toads leap after the bugs on deformed legs</p>
          <p>Damaged by rain they still sing in it </p>
          <p>The dolls are singing with them </p>
          <p><em>Bufo bufo</em> is the way it goes</p>
          <p><em>Bufo bufo bufo bufo </em></p>
          <p>Is the song of the pre-amniotic egg </p>
          <p>The amnion means water isn’t needed</p>
          <p>With time it gives rise to the placenta</p>
          <p>The placenta produces children screaming</p>
          <p>Along the river where the diplomats are meeting</p>
          <p>Trying to forge the weakest bonds</p>
          <p>Some are weeping and menstruating<br />
              <br />
            Hydrocarbon of course the world</p>
          <p>Weeping and menstruating </p>
          <p>Weeping and menstruating </p>
          <p>Water breaks at the cataract</p>
          <p>It is re-named The Weeping Diplomats </p>
          <p>All the water is breaking</p>
          <p>No one can hold onto it </p>
          <p>The dolls take their toads with them and slip away </p>
