            still I don’t have a never mind<br />
            to do away from self and other<br />
            daybreak</p>
          <p>how adhesive are you is the question<br />
            then came choice <br />
            the domesticity of choice befuddles<br />
            the grammar of choice <br />
            some sight some smell<br />
            the neighborhood equations for <br />
            to cut/ tell to cut<br />
            tell tell and absolutely <br />
            no one has heard any of it <br />
            here is a careworn thought</p>
          <p>a golden eagle checks the gasping pit<br />
            gravel mines follow daybreak <br />
            don’t look don’t touch is the song <br />

          <p>Ibn Maymoun was at the door hoping I read less on zero<br />
            hoping through fields of stem cell abundance <br />

            within the urge to connect<br />

          <p>is the neutral such?<br />
            how do where and how enter theme?<br />

            I had a dad and father and daddy<br />
            is that too synoptic for you?<br />
            venue is immaterial above that level of intensity<br />
            because content blinds it <br />
            because matter within seeks location <br />
            on top some mountain <br />
            I need you there <br />

            what is free or living must be commoditized and digitized <br />

            a world along a banister of questions<br />
            while that feels natural and lovely <br />
            I’m chancing not so lovely a breed <br />
            whose mantra past cannibalism still plays <br />
            my voice is my language and mine only<br />
