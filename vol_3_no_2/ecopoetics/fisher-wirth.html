          <div class="poem"><p>1.</p>
            <p>Soft rain. Skies white-gray the same as the water. I lie in the bottom bunk beneath a green-striped blanket here on Fogdö. I’ve wakened from a nightmare, taut with fear.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>And when I dream, what then? What, when the bombs are falling on Beirut and Haifa?</p>
          <p>At the conference, Lyn from Haifa said, <em>Nearly half my students are Arabs, the other half Israeli.</em></p>
          <p><em>When it gets really bad, I go to the sea and watch the fishing boats. Nothing has changed in their lives forever.</em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p>Two days ago, we were still in Scotland— <br />
              <em>the hottest day in the UK ever</em>.  A columnist <br />
            in the paper wrote of people's hideous fashions: <br />
            <em>Better get used to dressing well when it's hot; <br />
            after all, we'll have to cope with worse. </em><br />
            <br />
            Cope? We’ll choke, gasp, muffled.<br />
            Cry out, the trees are vanishing, <br />
            the blistering heat is rising. We will tip <br />
            the planet past the healing point and then—<br />
            Don't they know death wins, and flesh </p>
          <p> can be zapped fried seared, wars first for oil <br />
            then for stolen water, wars for air not just food? <br />
            Death will be the kind one, yet so plenteous <br />
            our gizmos there will be no silence, no darkness <br />
            even in death. Death, a brightly lit parking lot—</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4.</p>
          <p>How to be a muddy field, rank with germs,<br />
            <span style="margin-left:9em;">unseemly?</span></p>
          <p>Here at Fogdö there is beauty. <br />
            <span style="margin-left:3em;">Bushes</span> thick with blueberries <br />
            <span style="margin-left:12em;">scatter</span> among boulders. </p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:6em;">But</span> the dream-phrase jumps in my mind: </p>
          <p><em>There’s a choked chicken loged against the heart chakra. </em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5.</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:10em;">What</span> do we dream</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:3em;">What</span> do we dream</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:7em;">Be</span> advised<br />
            <span style="margin-left:3em;">I</span> do not exist</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:6em;">If</span> you are characters in my play<br />
            <span style="margin-left:1em;">it</span> does you no harm.<br />
                <br />
            <span style="margin-left:5.7em;">Daughter,</span> mother, wife—<br />
            what am I but passages of light<br />
            <span style="margin-left:9em;">through</span> wave, illuminating<br />
            <span style="margin-left:3em;">intransigence,</span></p>
          <p>and bread cupped in a palm,<br />
            <span style="margin-left:7em;">water</span> through hands<br />
            <span style="margin-left:3em;">that</span> feel and cherish with the fingertips<br />
            <span style="margin-left:9em;">each</span> slick of leaf, each bent branch</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:5.7em;">as</span> it flows or drifts into infinity—<br />
            The rabbits we saw in the field in Scotland</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:9em;">hopped</span> off to their nests beneath bushes<br />
            as sun hovered toward twilight over the river,<br />
            <span style="margin-left:5.7em;">the</span> limestone town, hill with distant cattle.<br />
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>6.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:10em;"><p>On the outhouse walls at Fogdö:<br />
            <br />
            A map of Norrtälje that shows Fogdö <br />
            at the upper edge, facing out to Alands Hav, <br />
            and, scattered all along, the thousands <br />
            of islands that form the Stockholm Archipelago. </p>
          <p> A print of soldiers called Det ivre or iure <br />
            af ett Soldattalt. Many children's drawings, <br />
            including a Polynesian maiden complete <br />
            with sword, grass skirt, coconut brassière, <br />
  <br />
            and palm tree. A kangaroo, by Susa. <br />
            Ballerinas, warriors, monsters. A very <br />
            friendly hedgehog. A bright pastel with beach <br />
            umbrella, grapes, a Cubist face, a guitar </p>
          <p> like a split papaya. Many bright splotches.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>7.</p>
          <p>—Sleep, says the sea, sleep, says the sea, the birds<br />
            thicken in the trees as light glints across the water.</p>
          <p>A breeze. Late afternoon, the light growing pewter,<br />
            soft Falun red of the ramshackle summer house </p>
          <p>soaking up shadows. Out on the water, a motorboat.<br />
            I would like to spend the curve of a year </p>
          <p>from bird cherries to mushrooms, <em>svamp</em>, in Sweden. <br />
            Trace the circle round through lilacs, king's-blood-lilies,</p>
          <p>lilies of the valley, then blueberries, strawberries,<br />
            raspberries, then lingonberries, apples.</p>
          <p>To gather them as they ripen, wander along<br />
            with that rapt purposeful emptiness, every sense alert</p>
          <p>for a glimpse of red or blue, the scrotal sponginess <br />
            of puffballs, luminescence of chanterelles. </p>
          <p>To know this place in the foison of its seasons.<br />
            And watch the light on water, day after day, </p>
          <p>empty out of my everlasting self-regard.<br />
            Let the sunlight, fog, or rain have its will with me.</p>
          <p><br />
          </p>
          <p>8.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p>At Fogdö, I thought, the silence of myself<br />
            would come back to me. But Frida’s children <br />
            cry as evening comes, and love's no easier <br />
            here where blueberries ripen on shin-high<br />
            bushes and wild strawberries nestle, sparse,<br />
            in the roadside ditches. Love's no easier<br />
            for Frida, our hostess, her new lover absent,<br />
            she grows thinner every day. She tells us, <br />
            <em>Here you may take coffee, and here,<br />
            on this bench, you may sit for romance.</em><br />
            The cove is quiet; the sky and sea<br />
            beyond the pines, one pewter blue.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>9.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:10em;"><p>Can't you stay awake one night<br />
            to watch the sky that never turns black</p>
          <p> grow light again? Can't you stay<br />
            awake one night to hear the soft rain?</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>10.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p>Where I live they are paving the world. <br />
            The oaks they’re “saving” perish, <br />
            hemmed in by concrete. Dogwoods parch <br />
            and wither in a season of no rain. <br />
            You'd think we'd think <br />
            of the collapse of systems—<br />
            at a certain point, there's nothing <br />
            to be done, technology cannot save us. <br />
            Earth sickens and sickens, and finally <br />
            turns mean. Only things with thorns survive.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>11.</p>
          <p>I’m reading Kandinsky, he speaks about green <br />
            as the resting point between yellow and blue, </p>
          <p>the color of tranquility and regeneration. <br />
            Surrounded by trees and water here at Fogdö, I want</p>
          <p>to be writing of peace, want to be moving into that deeper<br />
            harmony where earth and sea and sky seep into, into,</p>
          <p>every pulse of my blood. But to write of peace <br />
            right now is to be a tourist. She whose color</p>
          <p>and income buy her easy passage. She for whom peace<br />
            means comfort. She for whom aging means smaller.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>12.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p>Outhouse:</p>
          <p> Here, at eight, when Frida’s children go to sleep, <br />
            it's still soft daylight.  Gulls are crying over the inlet. <br />
  <br />
            And now they stop. It's absolutely silent—so silent <br />
            I can hear the spiders crawl on my pen across the page, <br />
            and each drop of pee falling in the bucket. <br />
  <br />
            Yes, this is 2006, it's not escape and not evasion: <br />
            the just-so of water, light, and silence.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>13.</p>
          <p>Now the <em>lip</em>, <em>lip</em>, <em>lip</em> of the quiet water between the islands. </p>
          <p>How to paint water?—the tiny ripples flowing<br />
            from right to left—and the islands <br />
            stretching away, each with its own tranquility. </p>
          <p>To live here through the seasons, be of this place,<br />
            like the sea captain buried in the graveyard: </p>
          <p>what battening down would it take, to survive winters? <br />
            In the distance, light catches a couple of tiny buildings,<br />
            and smoke rises, or is it a plume of clouds, </p>
          <p>far on the horizon. Little color in this scene—pearly gray,<br />
            charcoal gray, swan's-down, pine green; all twilit—</p>
          <p>On the water, an orange float partly hidden by grasses. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>14.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:10em;"><p>The voice says—<br />
            <span style="margin-left:6.4em;">Hear</span> what I say to you.</p>
          <p>When the dream cabinet finally opens, <br />
            two ravens will fly out </p>
          <p> and each will seize one of your eyes. <br />
            I am not apart from that pain. <br />
                <br />
            In that moment you will see me.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>15.</p>
          <p>A day of small birds and sunlight.</p>
          <p>Last night we sat with Frida in the red house <br />
            where her children were sleeping, and she lit candles. </p>
          <p>Suddenly I remembered our year in Sweden, <br />
            remembered it not just with the mind, but with my whole being, </p>
          <p>that poignancy of night, and candles. Such a settling-in, <br />
            points of light against all the night sky and all the woods, </p>
          <p>stretching North: your thought deepens and deepens <br />
            and for once you can sit still. Sweden, and such longing—</p>
          <p>walking down Dröttningsgatan in Uppsala each winter twilight, <br />
            toward the Fyris River, and Peter walking up to meet me, </p>
          <p>then linking arms, walking home, home by six p.m. and dinner, <br />
            then the hours till sleep stretching wide. Then, gulping sleep, </p>
          <p>unable to fall far enough, deep enough, into the gathering darkness—</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>16.</p>
          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p>Now Julia, five, is singing <br />
              <span style="margin-left:3em;"><em>La</em></span><em> la la la la <span style="margin-left:1em;">la</span> <span style="margin-left:1em;">la</span> la la la la la. </em></p>
          <p>And Logan, two, <br />
            <span style="margin-left:3em;">tosses</span> pebbles into the ocean, <br />
            <span style="margin-left:6em;">chants</span> <em>Bye bye weewee, bye bye weewee</em>. </p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>17.</p>
          <p>Kind summer, facing west as sun goes down. <br />
            The ducks still bob about the water, the Baltic opens up</p>
          <p>between the islands, and the body grows calm <br />
            in its own contingencies. On the pier at Fogdö </p>
          <p>a woman sits—a woman who is I—<br />
            and the sun shatters in a path across the water. </p>
          <p>The ducks drift to and fro, and a few birds <br />
            honk and chirp, shriek and coo. </p>
          <p>One motorboat's revving back across the water. <br />
            A spiderweb stretches like a line of laundry </p>
          <p>from a rock to the pier, catches the slant of diminishing daylight.<br />
            Now the ducks are swimming home, </p>
          <p>the little ones in front of their elders. Flies buzz my head. <br />
            Frida has just come out to wash Logan’s bottle. </p>
          <p>Amazing, to trust the world so much <br />
            you'll wash your baby's bottle in the ocean—</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>18.</p>

          <div style="margin-left:5em;"><p><span style="margin-left:6.2em;">You're</span> not coming, are you, <br />
            god of ferocity and exaltation? You're waiting <br />
            up there near the high mountain passes, <br />
            where the ravens wheel up against the sun, <br />
            and the tight green pinecones ripen like roses. <br />
            You're waiting and then you'll fall upon <br />
            some unsuspecting traveler, leap on his back <br />
            and ride him down. Me, I'm for the flat sea, <br />
            where the water ripples luminous<br />
            with the patina of old pewter. I'm for this calm <br />
            that has no words, the day spinning slowly <br />
            off its spool, and all night long the light not gone.</p></div>
          <p>20.</p>
          <p>I'm sitting on the pier as Peter sleeps beside me. <br />
            It's water nearly all the way around, <br />
            rippling with striations of shadow and light.</p>
          <p>The ducks are floating ahead of me, growing near <br />
            the forested island. The birds are crying their long good-nights. <br />
            Like being inside a pearl: the perfect roundness of the summer evening. </p>
          <p>Water—slate blue, gray-blue, with midges dancing on it. <br />
            Now the ducks are sailing away from me. <br />
            The sun still white, but sinking toward the horizon. </p>
          <p>Now the sun is a fish, caught in the Baltic seagrasses.<br />
            Peter sleeps peacefully, his whole face soft. Sometimes<br />
            I can't help touching him even though I know it will wake him. </p>

          <p>A single bird perches on a branch—a wren, a willow branch.</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:6em;">When</span> the doors of the dream cabinet open, the bird flies away...<br />
            <span style="margin-left:30.4em;">into</span> our lives.</p>
          <p><span style="margin-left:9em;">And</span> the branch remains, to carry its singing.          </p></div>
