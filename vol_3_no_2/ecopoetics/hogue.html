    <p>On the whole <br />
            earth human<br />
            history a herd <br />
            of sheep needing<br />
            to change course racing, <br />
            hurtling in apparently this <br />
            direction, from the lamb <br />
            of St. Agnes to recent<br />
            cloning, the concerns <br />
            to include loss <br />
            of cropland, the disastrous <br />
            to sublime becoming <br />
            one with our interests <br />
            and problems.  Understand <br />
            when I see in <br />
            the future I mention <br />
            the military in order<br />
            to propose building windmills <br />
            and a Fort I call Crystal.  I utter-</p>
    <p>ly ac-</p>
          <p>knowledge the present<br />
            use of forts <br />
            was an interim solution<br />
            but let’s talk <br />
            for the moment about <br />
            access not just <br />
            to rejuvenate that sense,<br />
            almost forgotten,<br />
            is not stranger to this phenomenon<br />
            of uniting long-alienated<br />
            disciplines by touching<br />
            on issues of individual<br />
            creation and social<br />
            conscience.  As in a garden the edges <br />
            of stones were carved <br />
            in a non-ego-based <br />
            legacy as if hardy <br />
            plants in peace took root.</p></div>

          </h2>
          <div class="poem"><p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>After months of study and debris<br />
            leaders inebriate with the findings <br />
            lose faith.  They criss-cross the land like pollen, hovering,<br />
            wavering:  Are we rooted yet? Are we grown?<br />
            Everyone sighs as the possible sweeps past the clutter. </p>
          <p>It’s tragic, carrying seeds of hope when whole forests <br />
            wilt cacophonously<br />
            and drought reigns.  Tensions rise like welts, red black and blue <br />
            reasons bobbing about like parti-colored helium balloons.</p>
          <p>We found the gash right away.<br />
            The Colonel wept: his wife had called <br />
            demanding he tell the truth or she'd jump with their child.<br />
            Once I, too, rushed from a plane believing <br />
            I'd meet my love resplendent in furs, with open, rendez-vous arms. </p>
          <p>But truly he could not speak. <br />
            She stood on the brink, impractical, needless <br />
            as exterminating nature because the white-tailed deer <br />
            breed ticks and taxpayers <br />
            protest.  For a time, so deft at denying,</p>
          <p>he convinced her the chasm a ditch and the road long <br />
            since overgrown with red oak and sweet gum.<br />
            Gummy saplings edged with sticky broomstick pine. <br />
            The wide blue air of the wild blue sky.</p>

          <p><span class="medgap"><em>adapted</em></span><em> from a 2004 issue of St. Petersburg Times</em><br />

          <div class="poem"><p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Saturday evening the tempest passed, but the bay still rose, its shoreline invisible, lost.  On Sunday, the waters withdrew.  People saw dry land.  On Monday, those waters roared back, crashing over balustrades onto the boulevard.  Meteorologists warned of winds causing a storm surge, which, during the night, snuck in like a cat and crept toward Cynthia Hogue's house on Ballast Point.  Her sandbags, placed against all doors, slept on as the water inched closer, then seeped in through cracks and crevices.  Cynthia Hogue, 69, woke to stand knee-deep in water and was not sanguine.  Glancing out the window as a boatload of teenagers rowed by sending havoc in their wake, she said, &quot;I wish they'd get stuck.&quot;  Water rippled inside her home. </p>
          <p>&quot;I have fought this for years and years,&quot; Cynthia Hogue said.  “Don’t drain the wetlands,” I argued.  “Birds need them.  We need them.  We do not need resorts.  We do not need casinos.”</p>
          <p>Elements lay strewn across her bed. Among the gold, the copper, the seaborgium, the tungsten, were notebooks from Hogue's ongoing fight with officials about coastal marshlands and hurricanes.  &quot;The storms come and no one listens to me.  I feel like dancing in them,&quot; she said.  &quot;What else can I do?  I've tried everything else depending on truth.&quot;</p>
          <p>But as she waded through her home on Ballast Point, Hogue decided not to count on truth anymore.</p></div>

            open up and saw<br />
            the consequences.  One client <br />
