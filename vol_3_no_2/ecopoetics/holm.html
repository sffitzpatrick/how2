          <div class="poem"><div class="boxed"><p align="center">From Ralph Waldo Emerson's &quot;Idealism&quot;</p>
          <p>It is, in both ____, that a spiritual ____ has been imparted to ____; that the solid seeming <br />
            ____ of ____ has been pervaded and dissolved by a ____; that this feeble human ____ <br />
            has penetrated the vast ____ of ____ with an informing ____, and recognised itself in <br />
            their ____, that is, seized their ____. In ____, when this is attained, the ____ disburthens <br />
            itself of its cumbrous ____ of ____, and carries ____ of ____ in a single ____.</p></div>
          <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="center">From Henry David Thoreau's &quot;Night and Moonlight&quot;</p>
          <div class="boxed"><p>Is not the ____ like ____ to most of us? Are we not tempted to explore it, â€” to penetrate <br />
            to the ____ of its ____, and discover the ____ of its ____, perchance the ____ of the <br />
            ____? Who knows what ____ and ____, moral and natural, are there to be found? In the <br />
            ____ of the ____, in the ____ of the ____, there is where all ____ have their hidden ____. <br />
            The ____ up the ____ as yet extend but to the ____, or perchance to the ____ of the ____; <br />
            but it is the ____ that concerns us.</p></div>

          <p align="center">From John Burroughs's &quot;The Apple&quot;</p>
          <div class="boxed"><p>With ____ and ____ we go out and penetrate through the ____ and frozen ____ till the inner ____ of ____ is laid bare. It is not quite as clear and bright as when we placed it there last ____, but the ____ beneath, which the ____ soon exposes, is just as bright and far more luscious. Then, as ____ after ____ you resort to the ____, and, removing the ____ and ____ from the ____, thrust your ____ into the fragrant ____, you have a better ____ than ever before to become acquainted with your ____ by the ____ of ____.</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="center">From John Burroughs's &quot;Sharp Eyes&quot;</p>
          <div class="boxed"><p>This would require, not more ____ so much as an ____ constructed with more and different ____; but would he not see with augmented ____ within the natural ____ of ____?  At any ____ some ____ seem to have opened more ____ than others, they see with such ____ and ____; their ____ penetrates the ____ and ____ where that of others fails like a spent or impotent ____. How many ____ did ____ open? how many did ____? how many did ____?</p></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="center">From John Burroughs's &quot;Emerson&quot;</p>
          <div class="boxed"><p>He is a ____ who occupies every ____ of his rightful ____; he is there in proper ____ to the farthest ____. Not every ____ is himself and his best ____ at all ____ and to his finger ____. Many great ____, perhaps the ____, have more or less neutral or waste ____. You must penetrate a ____ before you reach the real ____. Or there is a good wide ____ of the ____ which is sure to put them on good ____ with the ____ of their ____.</p></div>
