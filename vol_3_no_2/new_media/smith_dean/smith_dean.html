          <h1 align="center"><strong>Hazel Smith and Roger Dean</strong></h1>
          <h2 align="center"><em>Time, the magician</em> and <em>Minimal</em></h2>
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 align="justify">Working Note</h3>
          <p align="justify"><em>Time, the magician</em> (2005) is a collaboration by Hazel Smith and Roger Dean written in the real-time algorithmic image-processing program Jitter. The piece begins with a poem, written by Hazel, on the subject of time:&nbsp; influential on the writing of the poem was Elizabeth Grosz’s <em>The Nick of Time</em>.&nbsp; The poem is initially performed solo, but as it progresses is juxtaposed with live and improvised sound which includes real-time and pre-recorded sampling and processing of the voice. The performance of the poem is followed (slightly overlapping) by screened text in which the poem is dissected and reassembled. This screened text is combined in Jitter with video of natural vegetation, and the sound and voice samples continue during the visual display. </p>
          <p align="justify">The text-images are processed in real time so that their timing, order, juxtaposition, design and colours are different each time the work is performed. This Quicktime Movie is therefore only one version of the piece. The sound is from a performance given by austraLYSIS at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, October 2005. The performers were Roger Dean, computer sound and image; Sandy Evans, saxophone; Hazel Smith, speaker; Greg White, computer sound and sound projection.</p>
          <p align="justify"><em>Minimal </em>(2002) is a relatively sparse and ironic piece with text performed by Hazel Smith. In addition, pre-recorded samples of the voice are employed by Roger Dean with minimal processing in order to create multiple conflicting strands of speech. Again, each performance of the piece is unique.</p>
          <p align="justify">Both <em>Time, the Magician</em> and <em>Minimal</em> — along with six other pieces — appear on the CD-Rom by Hazel Smith and Roger Dean accompanying Hazel Smith’s new volume <em>The Erotics of Geography: poetry, performance texts, new media works</em>, <a href="http://www.tinfishpress.com" target="_blank">Tinfish Press</a>, 2008.</p>
