          <h2 align="center"><em>Modern Edith</em></h2>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="justify"><em>Modern Edith</em> began as a multimedia response to Caroline Bergvall’s <em>Goan Atom</em>.&nbsp; <a name="text1" id="text1"></a>I was interested in the grotesque figure of the doll in the poems, an investigation into what Drew Milne describes as ‘the aesthetics of imaginary dolls in contemporary sexual politics.’<a href="#note1" class="footnote">1</a>&nbsp; The doll as consumer and sexual object conflated with the doll as grotesque subject to set up and problematise contemporary sexuality in relation to art history and contemporary consumer culture.&nbsp; I was interested in using Flash to create my own doll, who would both represent a fetishised object of contemporary culture, and subversively reject this culture through excess and disgust. This doll, Edith, is made from old Barbie dolls, 1940s issues of <em>Housewife</em> magazine, felt pens, a scanner and a trial version of Flash MX.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="justify"><a name="text2" id="text2"></a>If, as Judith Butler states, ‘gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constructed in time – an identity instituted through a <em>stylised repetition of acts</em>’,<a href="#note2" class="footnote">2</a> then Edith is constructed through the enhanced fetishisation and objectification of the female body enabled by the internet, and the repeated acts of constructing femininity advocated by the same media.&nbsp; <a name="text3" id="text3"></a>I wanted my Flash system to enable the ‘possibility of a different sort of repeating, in the breaking and subversive repetition of that style’.<a href="#note3" class="footnote">3</a>&nbsp; I set up the windows to run on a loop, and animated the doll eating and dancing in a jerky, primitive style.&nbsp; The effect of this is a system of endless consumption and expulsion, beautification, flirtation. Through repetition, I wanted to create the effect of subverting and denaturalising these rituals by allowing them to become grotesque and excessive parodies of themselves. </p>
          <p align="justify"><a name="text4" id="text4"></a>The doll, as the subject of the piece, becomes a ‘posthuman’ figure in N. Katherine Hayles’ terminology, visibly ‘constituted as information’,<a href="#note4" class="footnote">4</a> glitches in the system making her tenuous existence as data in the space between pattern and randomness evident.&nbsp; <a name="text5" id="text5"></a>This also works metaphorically; I was interested in what Hayles writes about the ‘junk-as-information’<a href="#note5" class="footnote">5</a> market of late capitalism, <a name="text6" id="text6"></a>and that influenced my creation of clothing for the doll out of fragments of advertising from <em>Housewife</em> magazine, creating ‘a rational subject who is always already constructed by the forces of capitalist markets’.<a href="#note6" class="footnote">6</a></p>
          <p align="justify">In <em>Speculum of the Other Woman</em>, Luce Irigaray suggests that: ‘perhaps this is the time to stress <em>technique</em> again?&nbsp; <a name="text7" id="text7"></a>To renounce for the time being the sovereignty of thought in order to forge <em>tools</em> which will permit the exploitation of these resources’.<a href="#note7" class="footnote">7</a></p>
          <p align="justify">I feel that the system I have created in <em>Modern Edith</em> is an example of the political possibilities and new forms that might come about when forging new systems, or, at least, new ways of using and exploiting existing tools and systems.&nbsp; What I was trying to do in <em>Modern Edith</em>, more than anything, was to create a system in which existing materials are parodied in such a way that they feed into each other and demonstrate both the artificial social construction of gender and the potential woman-as-object dynamic which the Internet can perpetuate, exploiting this material to comment on itself and then placing it back into the context it came from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
