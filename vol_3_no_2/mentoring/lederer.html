          <h2 align="center"><strong>On Working with Lyn Hejinian</strong></h2>
          <p class="essayquote"><em>Reprinted from </em>Women Poets on Mentorship<em> by Greenberg and Zucker, with the permission of the University of Iowa Press.</em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">And so, as I sat in my dark little room, I decided to write her an email and ask her advice. I told her I was terrified. That I hadn't known what I was getting into, but that now I'd signed this contract, and what was there to do? My family, I told her, was furious with me. The writing, I told her, was not very good. Of course, these were all just excuses. What I really wanted, plain and simple, was to get out if it—to get out of the writing, to get out of the personal <em>risk</em>. As one might expect to feel about any full-length work based on one's life, my feelings about my memoir were ambivalent. After two years of working on the thing, I had lost all perspective. Lyn had always been for me an aesthetic and ethical ballast. Not trusting my own artistic judgment, I looked to her to tell me what was right and wrong, something I knew even then no artist can ever be fairly expected to do for another.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;There is nothing wrong with writing down a life,&quot; she replied. &quot;As I think you're aware, I have all my personal letters at the library down in San Diego, and I know how you feel, the idea of people being able to paw through your experience, to know your private life. It can feel awful, but it's truly a generous thing. We need to know of others' lives. If you think, of course, that this will follow you, then don't publish it.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">She was equivocal, trying to find the right level with her student who desperately wanted an out.</p>
          <p align="justify">I'm embarrassed now to admit to the loss of nerve I had then, but the conversation that resulted was one of the most important I have ever had—Lyn on the phone talking all about not just her life, but also the ways in which she'd written about it, written <em>through</em> it, and the importance of that. I think of this as the first time—no matter how much I may have adored her, no matter how much I'd looked up to her in all my years of school—that I realized she wasn't by nature a pedagogue. No, she too had a life, had equivocal, hard-earned desires: to write a few really good books. To be happy in her life and in her work. To make, as they say, a contribution to her art. She was, I could see, just a person, a human.</p>
