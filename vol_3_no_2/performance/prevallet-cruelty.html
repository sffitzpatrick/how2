            The United States has no<br />
            quarrel with the Iraqi people; they’ve suffered too<br />
            long in silent<br />
            captivity. Liberty for<br />
            the Iraqi people is<br />
            a great moral cause, and a great strategic<br />
            goal. The people<br />
            of Iraq deserve<br />
            it; the security of<br />
            all nations requires it. Free societies do not<br />
            intimidate through cruelty<br />
            and conquest, and<br />

            States supports political<br />
            and economic liberty<br />
            in a unified Iraq.<br />
