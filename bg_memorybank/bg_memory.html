Eliot&rsquo;s poetry, as a young poet who had not yet been introduced to modernism. <br />        +<br />        Some sixty-five years later, in her early 80s, she said of her on-going writing process: &ldquo;And the leaving out has helped me. Now I believe it&rsquo;s always more powerful when something&rsquo;s left out.&rdquo;<br />        .<br />        She continued: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate in that I&rsquo;ve had a real easeful time in construction, and I don&rsquo;t have it now. I just have a lot of difficulty. And I have to regain something that I&rsquo;ve deposited somewhere else&hellip;. I do think you have to get away. I think it&rsquo;s the real solution. The way a painter goes into the studio to work&hellip; (there) you cease being a good mother. Automatically&hellip;. At first, I did try to write at home. I remember there was an extra room and I tried to write at home. But the work was just awful&hellip;. I didn&rsquo;t want anything around me, and I still don&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want anything that brought congestion&hellip;. I have that room now. It&rsquo;s small, but I&rsquo;ve written a lot of books in it. I like it small.<br />        .<br />        &hellip;and then she said: &ldquo;Each poem is composed completely differently. It&rsquo;s what I call &lsquo;shuffling mind.&rsquo; I go a good deal by sound, and I mean I can write on sounds. I guess you can say I write by ear. That&rsquo;s really what I do.&rdquo;<br />        <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="250" height="5" />&mdash; (from a conversation, <em>Jacket</em>, 25)<br />+<br />She wrote: Berg changes to Shostakovitch. The Cyrillic alphabet just out, crosses in front of, enters the space the bus vacated. The poem laughs back and forth and comes the caw-like repetition. Strength comes to blows with Joy. The violins fly from steppe to steppe and in the Caucasus valleys stones skim and fall. A stocky tremolo with light flashing on the flung scabbards. Numbers work for you. Desire trudging beyond the golden mean. (<em>Seeking Air</em>, 119.

Giving her my book on Marianne Moore, <em>Omissions Are Not Accidents</em>, I was taken aback further when before her evening reading she had already dipped into it, enough to give me her assent: it was a book to be read about Moore and about poetry. The shadows shifted later that evening when I prodded her about her biography on H.D., <em>Her(self) Defined</em>, and she told me about a recognition between H.D. and herself. When I asked her to sign her book <em>Defensive Rapture</em>, she signed it, &quot;from Barbara with constant recognition.&quot; I thought several times about contacting her again, although I never did, things taking shape and things disappearing.</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><u>from THE TüRLER LOSSES</u></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Türler patterns<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="115" height="5" />distinct as <br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="115" height="5" />Palmyra ruins</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="115" height="5" />_________</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Wrist watches surround themselves with danger.<br />        Signs.

At the “Audacious Imagination” tribute to her life and work held at UC Berkeley in 2003, Barbara announced that she was “now writing surrealist poems,” adding “Though I came to surrealism late, it’s better late than never.” She then proceeded to give a reading of one of her greatest last poems, “Nostalgia of the Infinite” (a reference to De Chirico’s painting of the same title). </p>    <p align="left">Barbara subsequently shortened this title to one word: “Nostalgia.” Indeed, there was something of nostalgia in Barbara’s late engagement with surrealism. If it’s true that in old age we return to our roots, Barbara seems to have retraced her own roots here, going deeper than the aesthetics of the New York School and Abstract Expressionism to arrive at their surrealist sources. This lineage had already been made explicit, of course, in her essay “The Shadow of Surrealism.”</p>    <p align="left">Barbara’s “return” to surrealism may have been facilitated and encouraged by the milieu in which she found herself in later life, namely that circle of admiring young men with surrealist tendencies whom she fondly referred to as “the boys”: Garret Caples, Jeff Clark, and Brian Lucas. Despite being middle-aged, I also counted as one of Barbara’s boys. As Barbara’s neighbor in Berkeley (living only a few blocks away), I enjoyed regular afternoon visits with her for many years. Our conversations frequently revolved around Barbara’s interest in surrealist poetry and painting, and “what was happening now” in surrealism.</p>    <p align="left">However, the complexity of Barbara’s character and creative process ensured that her composition of “surrealist poems” never followed Breton’s (early) formula of “pure psychic automatism.” I was witness to the often agonizing, spiritually perilous process of revision, self-doubt, and self-rescue that the making of each new poem (even, and especially, a “surrealist” poem) entailed for Barbara. The terror of the blank page combined with an unshakeable imperative to always “make it new” meant that Barbara often needed to <em>trick</em> herself into writing (something, anything). The notion that she was writing surrealist poems was perhaps the last trick that Barbara played on herself.</p>    <p align="left">Or was it the last? Barbara, in another turn of this complex game, finally felt it necessary to efface some of the evidence of her surrealist self-trickery. The working title of her last book, <em>The Red Gaze</em>, had been, in the initial drafts, <em>Surrealism and Other Poems</em>. This subtitle was eventually dropped. A poem at first entitled “She Honors De Chirico” was retitled, significantly enough, “Loneliness,” indicating perhaps the withdrawal of an enabling presence. Surrealism had become once more a shadow. Nonetheless, both in its process of composition and in its structure, <em>The Red Gaze</em> recapitulates the history of surrealism’s development into Abstract Expressionism, as its evocations move from De Chirico to Hans Hoffmann––and so recaptures the New York art scene of the fifties in which Barbara experienced her emergence as a poet.</p>    <p align="left">Thus, this book, which was published and brought to her bedside as she lay dying, was really about her own birth. Yet even after the completion of <em>The Red Gaze</em>, Barbara continued to be haunted by her surrealist sources. Her final poem, “Hotel Comfort,” left unfinished at the time of her stroke, makes repeated and explicit reference to surrealism (as a source of comfort?) and testifies to the convulsive beauty that inhabited her to the end. <br />    </p>    <p align="left"><u>Hotel Comfort</u></p>    <p align="left">Minutes each hour took ostrich leaps on the roof of the Hotel Comfort in Strasbourg.<br />      These Surrealist moments cherished each roof a long time.<br />      In the thickened weather of Surrealism the cathedral is across the street.</p>    <p align="left">Wise lettuces exaggerate their claim near the window of the Hotel Comfort.<br />      And you have sent your letter of explanation for the pleasure obtained<br />      in the wooden jar.

I say she left it to “me,” because I experience it that way. Meanwhile, the courage and beauty of her poems grow and grow in my apprehension. The force is like a surprise. </p>    <p align="left">A while ago, I thought of reading Holderlin, because I was suffering and I wanted to connect in my writing with a larger world of spirit. I found a book of Holderlin’s I’d forgotten, which Barbara had sent me almost twenty years ago. There was a short note about the translator, a friend of a friend, and this closing: “May the poems bring their own focus of life to you – and their strength from abysses all his own.”</p>    <p align="left">I keep the book close to me, even though her wafting presence of poetry is so palpable. I didn’t expect a spirit clearing a path in addition to her work making the path. I chose SHELLEY IN THE NAVY-COLORED CHAIR, a late poem, with gratitude to Hadley Guest for giving me a copy and for so much more.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><u>SHELLEY IN THE NAVY-COLORED CHAIR</u></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">I sit so close to him, our minds entwine</p>    <p align="left">I assume his stewardship through the cold and mist.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">There is no other beauty with which he is equipped.</p>    <p align="left">The pain, the exclamation!</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">Early morning when the tide lowers</p>    <p align="left">and we manipulate our choices.</p>    <p align="left">To see, to feel, to engender memory</p>    <p align="left">of this place where Shelley walked.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">He is near.</p>    <p align="left">He breathes into the alphabet I found upon my chair.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">A dissertation they brought me, exclaiming why</p>    <p align="left">he failed to ride the unswept sea, and like</p>    <p align="left">a nautilus drowned in heavy seas, windswept</p>    <p align="left">like the alphabet he enriched.</p>    <p align="left">Each day a chambered nautilus near my chair.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">To add more stanzas to this alphabet</p>    <p align="left">is the view Shelley takes.</p>    <p align="left">More haste and less worry in the words gathered around him.</p>    <p align="left">A light gleaming over their shoulder,</p>    <p align="left">before the ecclesiastic wonder breaks out</p>    <p align="left">into praise for words he gathered,</p>    <p align="left">pearls surround the armchair.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">to list of contributors</a></p>    <hr />    <p align="left" class="TITLE2">5/10/06</p>    <p align="left"><em><a name="robinson" id="robinson"></a>chosen by</em> Elizabeth Robinson<br />      <strong>A Reverie on the Making of a Poem, June 1998</strong><br />      <em>from</em> <u>Civil Disobedience</u>, an anthology of writings<br />      from the Naropa Summer Writing Program<br />    </p>    <p align="left">I met Barbara when I was a graduate student at Brown. She came for a reading and I was mostly too abashed to say anything, but had a nice conversation with her when I drove her, I think, to the train station. So I was surprised and deeply moved when, about six months later a letter–which I still possess–arrived from her telling me that my Burning Deck chapbook, My Name Happens Also has struck her as evidence that I was a real poet. I think I was too tongue-tied even to write back. When she moved to California, she gave everevidence of remembering who I was and plenty of times, more than I understood, extended her friendship to me. I am extremely grateful for her openness to my theological preoccupations, for her supportiveness of my work. On my last day in California before moving to Colorado, I went to visit Barbara. I was exhausted and dirty and constantly on the verge of tears, but she kept saying emphatically and enthusiastically that I was doing a great thing by moving, by taking on a new job and a new community. She reminded me how welcoming Naropa would be and that I was lucky Dorn was long gone from CU. I left encouraged and resolute. The last flowers I had from my California garden I left with Barbara.</p>    <p align="left">The night before I heard of her death, my kids were sleeping and I was otherwise alone. I thought of Barbara with enormous warmth and so went and got all of her books and laid them out beside me on the bed, looking through them. I fell asleep with Forces of the Imagination beside me, opened to &quot;The Beautiful Voyage.&quot;</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><u>A Reverie on the Making of a Poem, June

(<em>Wesleyan University Press</em>, 1999)</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"> I chose a piece of Barbara's writing from the early-nineties. Barbara presented what was to become Section III of Rocks on a Platter at a reading with Mei-mei Berssenbrugge in 1994 in San Francisco. I asked if I could have a copy because I was about to teach a course on new poetry by women, and she handed me the print-out, with a few markings. It was entitled ''Others.'' To introduce her work to the class I first studied the piece line by line, as a poem that stood on its own (I'm not sure at what point she decided to make it a part of the book). When it appeared in Rocks on a Platter, I was struck by how well it worked in context of the melodic stepping stones and verbal ''chimes'' of that book, which is one of her most elusive and magnetic. She seems to be in conversation with space and place, with Adorno's philosophy, with ideas of construction, with making the modernist lyric step out into the page. <br />  I was able to visit with Barbara often when she was in Rounceville. A few months before her death, she seemed agitated when I entered and asked, ''Brenda, tell me, how do you write a poem?'' I said almost automatically, ''Well, I think I just put one word next to the other and see what happens.'' She said, ''Well, that's exactly what I do and it isn't working any more!'' I told her it had worked for her many times and that she had many readers who love her poems. This will continue to be true as her work goes into the world. Like many other people, I miss her tremendously.</p>    <p align="right"> March 14, 2006<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="100" height="5" /></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="200" height="5" />Intimacy of tone</span></p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />and form</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />beyond the tangible itinerary</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="doublespaceStandardText"><br />        <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="220" height="5" />mirror trap<br />    </span></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="175" height="5" />at 30 degrees</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="175" height="5" />I have the impression of a long body<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="200" height="5" />of loaves and fishes,</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="200" height="5" />of ''belles letters.''<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">*<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Wisdom in travel several palaces</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />latitude without margin</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />silver-toned blow up--;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">arm in a sling and hawk chin</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="15" height="5" />you are also a hawk--</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">you walk in hawk shadow a guise --, </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">Sad rose, Rilke charm</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />lodged in a castle--</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">bone button sewed to a coat--;</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">snow footprints adieu</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText">cold tears splashed acre is intimacy,<br />    </p>    <p align="left"><span class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />and many chimed things,<br />        <br />        <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="150" height="5" />future's conduit.</span></p>    <p align="left"><br />    </p>    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">to list of contributors</a></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;    </p>    <p> </p>    <hr />    <p align="left" class="TITLE2"><a name="dien" id="dien"></a>5.5.06</p>    <p align="left"><em>chosen by</em> Patricia Dienstfrey <br />      <strong>Transcription</strong><br />      <em>from</em> <u>Miniatures</u> (<em>Wesleyan University Press</em>, 2002)<br />    </p>    <p align="left">Attuned to sounds of loss</p>    <p align="left">I met Barbara Guest in the early nineties. And, like many Bay Area poets after she moved to Berkeley, I spent afternoons in her living room enjoying her conversational phantasmagorias of tale, reminiscence, history, insight, gossip and critique. In Rounceville, the facility where she lived during the last months of her life, her observations on her day-to-day existence there were added to the mix. That her part of the room had no windows and that the corridors offered no views out onto the world hardly made an impression. Barbara believed in the power of imagination and of the unconscious to transcend the limits that consciousness imposes on experience. These beliefs continued to shape her reality and responses, which were so immediate, her “yes” and “no” to ideas, expressions, forms like no other’s. During these conversations, I became attuned to sounds of loss in Barbara’s work, to tones and images that address not just her own losses but a generation’s. WOUNDED JOY was her first choice of title for the book of her writings on writing, which was published by Kelsey Street Press as FORCES OF IMAGINATION in 2003. As an editor for Kelsey Street, I read the manuscript in preparation for production, and I think the final title we all agreed to is appropriate for this collection. But her first choice struck me as an inspired title for a book on art and poetry in the twentieth century. Barbara understood the dark side of the time she lived in and of modernism. And she confronted it in her penultimate book of poems, MINIATURES, published in 2002. She said a number of times that she nearly came to the end of her energies writing it, that she didn't know if she would have anything left for more poems. But she did. And she enjoyed bringing out every poem in the next book, THE RED GAZE, which she dictated, as the poems came, to her daughter, Hadley. Published in 2005, it is the last book of poetry by Barbara that we have.<br />    </p>    <p align="left"><u>Transcription</u> </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Go sit, listen.

That is when our tradition of picnics began. Besides Dorothy Richardson, we both had great fascination with Los Angeles, dolmas, kasseri cheese, black cured olives, hotels, Robert Walser, <u>Close Up</u>, movies, H.D. of course… I would knock on the half open door of the studio. Once when I came in she pointed to the blackboard. On it were words written long ago in chalk that became a poem from that time. <u>Quill, Solitary <em>Apparition</em></u> was published in 1996; perhaps the poem from the chalkboard is in that book.

By noon, as the fog burned off, it smelled of wild anise heating up. From the table we ate on we could see a bit of the bay — our “view.” When she gave up the studio the picnics moved inside. Along with food, I sometimes brought flowers to stand in for the field. After one picnic Barbara sent me some photos (below) of the house after I left and a note that said,</p>    <p align="left">Susan,</p>    <p align="left"> I breakfasted on food of the gods this morning, having supped their nectar, thanks to you.

That meeting led to what became an ongoing correspondence mostly via email (many letters back and forth between November 18, 2003 and December 20, 2004), an occasional letter or postcard in the US mail. The first of the emails, written after her visit to Bolinas, reads simply “Steve, Thank you for inviting me to your piece of paradise, I was enchanted – the freshness of the earth and the beauty of the landscape and your close friends. Thank you for introducing me to Juliana. Barbara” And a week later, the draft of a poem she called “SNOW COVERS THE RED GAZE,” whose last line reads “Blue enters from the left.” Three days later she wrote “The last line of ‘Red Gaze’ is now ‘Blue enters later.’” And when I asked her what thoughts had led to that change, she wrote back “You said you wished you knew the thinking that changed ‘Blue enters from the left’ to ‘Blue enters later. ‘It’s all in the sound of the ‘Ls.’” Months later, as the war continued, she returned to that thought about that line, noting “I feel a nostalgia towards the early days of our correspondence and I'm certain this will not leave me. There was the little robin in ‘The Brown Vest’ and ‘blue enters later’ in ‘The Red Gaze.’ I remember your asking, ‘what does that mean?’ and my saying, ‘blue is always late.’ How did I ever think of that? Around the edge of that poem was always the terrible war in Iraq, and even the hotel in Iraq, the Ishtar Sheraton. Other hotels were hit by rocket fire, but the Ishtar Sheraton has escaped so far, protected we hope, by Goddess Ishtar.” Previously, after a lapse of six weeks in our correspondence, the message from BARBGUEST@aol.com ended “I miss our mythical jaunts.” As now indeed do I.<br />    </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><u>The Red Gaze</u></p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Red, purple, brown Guardian leaf.<br />      Complications of red enter the leaf<br />      and it is more accomplished,<br />      turning brown then gray in varying attitudes<br />      after the snow begins.

I met her very briefly then, and again later at other readings and book parties. My impressions on meeting her for the first time remained with me. Barbara Guest as luminous, all friendliness and graciousness, composed, quiet. I had read <em>Seeking Air</em>, the H.D. book and some poems. At the festschrift I met her daughter, Hadley, and H.D.'s daughter, Perdita, and floated. I met new friends, heard the distinguished panelists, and soaked in the light and oscillations that reverberated from Barbara Guest’s presence. She made so much possible because of her integrity, that combination of rigor and playfulness—her poems no longer about the words, but stretching into shimmering mysterious presences.</p>    <p align="left"> “Tessera” is a bittersweet poem, full of “sadness and felicity.” I was initially drawn to it by the lines in the second part having to do with “Inertia.” I’ve struggled so much with inertia in the writing process that I immediately seized on this connection, the inertia not just of resistance but of the fear that one will “lack the skill” (another of “inertia’s” Latin meanings), that one will be distracted by sleep and other things, “explanations” for example. On one side Philomène, the nightingale, bringing its song and heat, on the other Inertia, so lovely sounding, pulling the poet away from all those “Hot turns.” Once one arrives in “the land of sunbeams and/silk oaks” it seems “easy,” but first one has to gently call away inertia and let oneself be drawn into the mosaic of ghosts and thistles (the mysterious stripped clad “sadness and felicity”) that suggest the hidden. “The poem is the unburdening of ghosts of the past who have come to haunt the writer exposed to the labyrinth. These are ghosts not of words; they are the ephemera that surround and decorate the mind of the poet, a halo rescued from life.” (from “Mysteriously Defining the Mysterious,” <em>Forces of the Imagination</em>, p. 85).<br />    </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;    </p>    <p align="left"><u>TESSERA</u></p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText"><span class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="100" height="5" /></span>1.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Sadness and felicity<br />      you’re coming back<br />      ghosts in your striped Greek dress.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Tears go into the urn<br />      Philomène brings up the brazier<br />      things heat up<br />      water, wine, thistles in the jug.<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText"><span class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="100" height="5" /></span>2.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Hot turns.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">More.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I said to her, “Go away Inertia,<br />      beautiful, fragrant, violet as you are<br />      go away.”</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">She kept talking about letters, diaries,<br />      quotations, explanations,<br />      words linking me to sleep.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">I said, “Go away Inertia,<br />      even if you bear a Latin name.”<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText"><span class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="100" height="5" /></span>3.</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Then it was dark on the quarries.<br />      I had to hire a truck to load up.<br />      My boxes.

There was a stoic grace to her posture; the demeanor of someone who had learned to protect something important---defensive rapture, maybe. I am not sure when we first met; it may have been when I invited her to read at PS1 in the late 1970s or early 1980s. That was the first time I heard her read, from, I think, The Countess from Minneapolis. She gave me some personal objects when she left for California. Among them, a gray coat she had bought in Paris; she said it was &quot;good.&quot; It doesn't fit me, but I love to have it in my closet; it reminds me of her; it has a shape that floats. She had kindness and severity, the latter I associated with her ambition for poetry; her own, of course, but mostly for the ongoing fact of it. She made me feel less lonely as a poet. She told me she thought mystery was the most important poetic value.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"> <u>The Surface as Object</u></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p

The page-by-page constellations found in <em>Rocks on a Platter</em> [the force of which spatiality is mostly lost in translation here] demonstrate that if Mallarme is presupposed, a decidedly extreme textual sampling recreates his poetics. Her spacing is primarily of literature and of literariness, as is indicated in the remarkably located &quot;<em>thee</em> GLOSS GLOSS&quot; --this being text, intertext and metatext all at once. And well met are these words in proximate space which does away with the possibility of resemblance and of reference, for each of these words are indexical of something that cannot be reconstructed. The constellations in <em>Rocks on a Platter</em> are not verbal ruins, nostalgic for a past; excavated extremity, they are constituted of themselves. This is a poem made of spacing, of paratactic sense at the expense of meaning, or of meaning contented indeterminate and indifferent to illustrating sense.<br />    </p>    <p align="left"><u>Rocks on a Platter</u><br />    </p>    <p align="left">IV [excerpt]</p>    <p align="left">The Moment a limit is posited<br />      <em>It is overstepped, and that<br />      Against which the limit was<br />      Established is absorbed</em><br />      ADORNO, <em>Aesthetic Theory</em></p>    <p align="left">_______<br />    </p>    <p align="left">Without shyness or formality<br />    </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>“a gesture if <em>allowing oneself time</em>”</p>    <p align="left">Remember how starry it arrives the hope of another idiom, beheld<br />      <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="25" height="5" /></span>That blush of inexactitude, and the furor, it<br />      <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>Will return to you, flotsam blocked out.<br />    </p>    <p align="left">________</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>compose, like Schoenberg, <em>poem</em> music<br />    </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="160" height="5" /></span>“robustly”<br />    </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>“flotsam of the world of appearances”<br />      <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>drifting by and out of the picture.<br />    </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="140" height="5" /></span>Where the throne disappears.</p>    <p align="left">________</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="25" height="5" /></span>now in robust position,<br />      NAMING </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="10" height="5" /></span>naming the throne “<em>flotsam of appearances</em>”<br />    </p>    <p align="left"> ALLOWING TIME.<br />      ________<br />      <br />      <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="10" height="5" /></span>Is evanescence the wool beggar?<br />  strike that simpleton<br />  <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="230" height="5" /></span>“Bafflement?”</p>    <p align="left"> <em><span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="110" height="5" /></span>Thee</em><span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="15" height="5" /></span>GLOSS<span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="25" height="5" /></span>GLOSS </p>    <p align="left"> <br />      <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="80" height="5" /></span>point to the Mix, and </p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="110" height="5" /></span>there!

The day of the appointed conversation in Berkeley was one of those crisp fall days, and as soon as we gathered to talk, it felt good to be there. While asking Barbara about whether surrealism had influenced her, I read her a passage from <em>Forces of Imagination</em>, to which she responded, &quot;Did I write that?&quot; Beth Frost stepped in at that point to help, and said, &quot;I guess we're asking you about how you write poems!&quot; Barbara laughed wryly. Her answer: &quot;I guess you <em>are</em> asking me that!&quot; In all, the four of us spoke for four intensive hours, and then relaxed together over a leisurely lunch at Barbara's favorite restaurant. It was a halcyon day for reasons that were subtle and unspoken; we savored the moment's fellowship. In those few short hours, I felt that I understood something essential about Barbara, who was both meticulous and regal in her keen intelligence, undimmed in her work up to all but the very end. </p>    <p align="left">Among my favorite passages is this one from &quot;The Turler Losses,&quot; a stanza that I thought was the end, but was a moment too intensively sentimental to end a Guest poem:<br />    </p>    <p align="left">&quot;my image against your shoulder, the homespun<br />  logic of our twosomeness, a fabric time<br />  will displace, the threads, a shrivel here,<br />  there a stain, the rotting commences like lanes<br />  of traffic hurtling into air as the sun comes down.&quot;<br />  <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="270" height="5" /></span>(SP 110)</p>    <p align="left">I still love it.

She was very kind to me, though at first a little regal; we understood one another much better after the interview was over and the pressure was off. Looking at a picture I took of her that day I notice her well-cut blond hair—it must have been dyed, as she was in her mid-70s, but it looked great. Her eyebrows just slightly darker. Stylish, stylish, in person and in poetry. Guest’s work then and now seems to me to be a gorgeous mystery, gems constellated in a black sky. Not mysterious because meaning is not available in her writing—it is available—but because the relationships between wordgroups are so tensely and intuitively constructed; lines are balanced like the objects hanging from a mobile. I value her faith in poetic mystery and her belief that poetic form does and should evolve. I don’t understand what happens in my mind as I move from one line to the next: I’m just electrified, quietly and beyond reason. </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="standardUnderlined">Bird of Art</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />THERE CAME A CLOUD IT SETTLED ON YOUR <br />      SHOULDER.<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="20" height="5" />The cloud seeks high culture, after Ovid.</span></p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="120" height="5" />To soar through domes, bird of Art,<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />Halfway to icy heaven.<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="90" height="5" />Halfway to heaven search in high space, in deep<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="85" height="5" />crevasse.<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="215" height="5" />Knighthood.<br />    </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="doublespaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="160" height="5" />Poesie be engendered after OVID. </p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">to list of contributors</a></p>    <hr />    <p align="left" class="TITLE2"><a name="rosenwasser2" id="rosenwasser2"></a>3.21.06<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="TITLE2"><span class="standardText"><em>chosen by </em> Rena Rosenwasser<br />        <strong>“Confucius”</strong><br />        <em>from</em> </span><span class="standardUnderlined">The Confetti Trees</span><span class="standardText"> (<em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>, 1999)<br />        </span></p>    <p align="left">Memories rich in the lore of Lubitsch, Lang and Stravinsky</p>    <p>Barbara was invited to read at the Santa Fe Institute of Indian Art. During the airplane ride she kept gazing at a monitor where you could track the position of the plane at every point. She took childish delight in gazing at the flight pattern. One would have thought she was maneuvering the plane. Later when we began to drive to our destination, pinion, arroyos, and numerous mesas surrounded us. I found myself snared by these sites and smells. Barbara, on the other hand, felt disconsolate. New Mexico upset her. She was uneasy and agitated by vast desert space; definitely a creature more disposed to oceans, the theme that played a part in the California of her adolescence. She was also inclined to palms, plane trees &amp; memories rich in the lore of Lubitsch, Lang and Stravinsky. These were the émigrés that had inhabited the Los Angeles she came to reside in as a child. They represented a compelling world of the imagination and Barbara embroidered their narratives into her own.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><u>&quot;Confucius&quot;</u></p>    <p align="left">The actress was washing her face the camera picking up her motions slowly with great emphasis on the wrists, she had a way of flexing them that was unique and the director wanted the camera to catch this movement. The cameraman was from Sweden and he understood the delicacy of piecing together snow floes. He understood the scenario, how snow rinses her wrists slowly, without being told he slowed his camera, so that the audience might grasp the meaning of snow on the wrists of the actress, and the snow that the wrists moved through. He was filming &quot;slow whiteness.&quot; Lightning was important and the lighting assistant, Swedish also was selected because he understood the business of snow as it enters the atmosphere. The dialogue that takes place between it and day as it begins and as it ends gathering a momentum of whiteness. The film becomes more than a contemplative movement of wrists. In the beginning water that fell from her face to her wrist served as an introduction. At that point the story line needed to be photographed from far above. Only later in close-up details were sharpened to pick up the signature of a woman's face. There seemed to be no misunderstanding as to who indeed was the star and what role the camera played, each subsisting on snow. Within the screenplay originally fixed solely on the ability of the actress to flex her wrists (camera shot of wrists) (camera preys on face above her wrists) a secondary plot was now beginning to develop as snow and light crossed the face of the actress. The actual fact of her washing, the Director now realizes, has become a subsidiary plot in need of more complex artistry.</p>    <p align="left">The Director is a difficult man. His sudden changes of mood often cause alarm. In exasperation he picks up a book lying on a table nearby and throws this book hitting the sink where the actress washes, narrowly missing her wrists. It is silent film so we do not hear a plaintive voice, or the sound of the book striking.</p>    <p align="left">We see the trembling of the actress as the book narrowly misses her wrists. Without any prompting she picks up (no sound to delude us) and guides the book up to her face where we see written on its cover <em>The Sayings of Confucius</em>. “She is reading Confucius!&quot; we repeat over and over, as we savor the Director's silent applause. </p>    <p align="left"><span class="standardText">[For a description of the collaborative process involved in designing the book <em>MUSICALITY</em>, go to Rosenwasser's <strong><em><a href="/postcard.htm">postcard</a></em></strong>]</span></p>    <p align="left" class="TITLE2">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">to list of contributors</a></p>    <hr />    <p align="left" class="TITLE2"><a name="adnan" id="adnan"></a>3.14.06<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText"><em>a note from</em> Etel Adnan<br />    </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Adio, Barbara</p>    <p align="left" class="standardText">Heard that Barbara Guest died.

I’m not sorry in the usual sense, I’m thinking. Her poetry already starts to take another significance. I can’t tell which one. It breathes differently. She will not add to it. She won’t interfere in anything. She was high-strung, almost haggard. Burning the air around her with tension—I think of 16th century Spanish nuns, Catalans, maybe. Very clear pale blue eyes, on the alert. Passion for poetry, for excellence about all. For the gift of Language. The English language. In fact, an ancient person. Perhaps a reincarnation, if that proves to be true. An alerted thin animal.

I know that Perdita was also there, and it was very exciting for me to be able to share my appreciation of HD with them. They seemed to complement each other, and make sense of HD the woman, as well as HD the writer. The poetry collection of Guest&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m most familiar with is the book published in the UK by Reality Street in 1999, <em>If so, tell me</em>. I read and made notes on it while I was in Edinburgh, attending the Edinburgh festival, and visiting some of the local sites, especially those associated with Mary Queen of Scots. A poem I wrote then, &lsquo;the diamond speaks&rsquo;, about Mary&rsquo;s dangerous political subterfuge, is clearly influenced by Guest, both in its allusiveness and use of visual design, as well as the pleasure of exploring Mary&rsquo;s (Barbara&rsquo;s) inventions and constructions. I feel as though I was with Barbara Guest then and am again now, in writing this.

Robert Rosenwasser and I visited the special printer, Peter Rutledge Koch, and great care was given to getting the right set up for this book, &quot;Musicality&quot;.

She was very impressive, and luckily we &quot;clicked&quot;. Because of her interest in painting, we had a real connection. She'd done reviews for <em>Art News</em> and <em>Art in America</em>. It was a treat later to read her wonderful &quot;Durer in the Window Reflections on Art&quot;. When she suggested our collaborating on a book, it was in New York City, at her place on 16th St. She served a scotch and soda and we celebrated the occasion. I felt that I had suddenly become sophisticated! It was a happy time. Barbara was so easy to work with. She loved doing books with artists and I think this was partly because she really was an artist herself. Her collages, made in New York, were great to see on the covers of several of her books.</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="standardUnderlined">MUSICALITY</p>    <p align="left"><em>The wave of building murmur <br />        <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="120" height="5" />fetid<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="30" height="5" />slough from outside <br />a brown mouse<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="20" height="5" />a tree mouse. </em></p>    <p align="left"><em> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="120" height="5" />two trees leaning forward <br />      the thick new-made emptiness<br />    </em></p>    <p align="left"><em> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="130" height="5" />Naturalism. </em></p>    <p align="left"><em> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />Hanging apples<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="40" height="5" />half notes <br />      in the rhythmic<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="40" height="5" />ceiling<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="40" height="5" />red flagged <br />      rag clefs <br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="135" height="5" />notational margins <br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="145" height="5" />the unfinished <br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="155" height="5" />cloudburst </em></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><em>a barrel cloud fallen from the cyclone truck<br />      they hid under a table the cloud <br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="90" height="5" />with menacing disc </em></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><em> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="35" height="5" />Leaves ripple in the dry cyclonic </em></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><em><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="215" height="5" />levelled crusts—</em></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left"><em> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />for four hands<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="15" height="5" />of chambered<br />  breeze &amp;

Barbara and Hadley moved to Berkeley around the same time, and Peter Gizzi and Elizabeth Willis landed in Santa Cruz. As new arrivals, we made a fragile bond with both. From the viewpoint of San Francisco, we all hailed from &ldquo;the East.&rdquo; It brought to mind the Saul Steinberg drawing in which Manhattan takes up three-fourths of the country, and a thin strip in the distance includes all the rest. </p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Barbara very graciously invited Maxine and me to lunch at the house she rented on Milvia Street. On the outside, it was a modest two-story stucco draped with vines. But the inside had been redesigned so that the second floor consisted of a modernist catwalk of blue metal that had space for a bed and Barbara&rsquo;s writing desk. A New York loft had been stuffed into a cottage. It seemed the perfect collision of hominess&mdash;old wood, books, a dusty stereo&mdash;and the postmodern. In some ways, the house paralleled Barbara&rsquo;s work, which has both warmth and the cool edge of steel and innovation. The other guests were Rena Rosenwasser, publisher of Kelsey Street Press, and Andrew Joron. When Andrew said that his favorite magazine was Sulfur, Barbara quickly insisted on the value of our magazine, New American Writing. On another occasion, when a leading San Francisco figure complained about being served fruit Jello in Minneapolis, Barbara defended the Midwest culinary arts, in case we might be offended. Later she came to our housewarming, a major trip that involved crossing one of San Francisco&rsquo;s bridges, a Bay Area sign of social commitment. On that occasion, Maxine&rsquo;s widowed Uncle Kurt, a charming man with continental manners, chatted her up. We were amused because Kurt had recently dated all seventy-seven women who&rsquo;d responded to his newspaper ad for companionship. </p>    <p align="left"><span class="at150spaceStandardText">I chose &ldquo;Noisetone&rdquo; because it shows Barbara&rsquo;s painterly sensitivity to the &ldquo;light of fiction and the light of surface,&rdquo; to quote her poem &ldquo;Wild Gardens Overlooked by Night Lights.&rdquo; Ashbery interrupts his investigations with humor. Barbara&rsquo;s poetry seeks not to surprise but to take up lodging within the moment, reflecting the light of one perspective toward the darkness of another. Green is the sound of the moment; the future is written in its white spaces.</span></p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left" class="standardUnderlined"> Noisetone</p>    <p align="left"> <span class="at150spaceStandardText"><img src="media/spacer.gif" width="50" height="5" />Each artist embarks on a personal search.<br />        <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />An artist may take introspective refreshment from green.</span></p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText">Or so they say in Barcelona when air is dry.<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />In our country it is a water sprinkler than hints, &ldquo;rinsed green.&rdquo;<br />      <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="100" height="5" />Colors often break themselves into separate hues</p>    <p align="left" class="at150spaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />of noisetone.<img src="media/spacer.gif" width="40" height="5" />In a Barcelona cabaret when green is overtaken,<br />      it is stirred into the mint color of drink.</p>    <p align="left"><span class="at150spaceStandardText"> <img src="media/spacer.gif" width="60" height="5" />The spirit is lifted among primary colors.

I had written &quot;off&quot; my undergraduate work as that kind of precious juvenilia only one's twenty-one-year-old self could write, but remembering her has allowed me to reclaim this juvenilia with a sense of urgency. When I heard of her death I pulled out what I wrote on her work for my undergraduate thesis and, now as I'm writing my dissertation on the Berkeley Renaissance community, realize that Guest's poetry and poetics essays lured me to strive for a prose that might eloquently discuss her arrangements of art, reality, imagination, and the on-going dialogues between them. I chose &ldquo;The Glass Mountain,&rdquo; written in memory of James Schuyler, because it functions as a conversation between the poets&rsquo; works and focuses particularly on the interacting forces of personal observation, idealized interpretations of reality, and the composition of poetry as a seizing, artistic force.

I came to dislike the cold north light of the apartment and I admit I was unhappy while I lived there. However, the owner's library included several books on Kandinsky. There was one book that quoted him on the necessity in art for an &quot;inner sound.&quot; To me, this is the essential &quot;noise&quot; of poetry. Another book showed photographs of Kandinsky's Moscow apartment. The artist, his ideas, and his dwelling place became a solace to me.</p>    <p align="left">One day looking down on Union Square from the apartment, the sudden realization arrived that Union Square looked remarkably like the Moscow park seen from Kandinsky's apartment.</p>    <p align="left">Several years passed and I moved near the south side of Union Square. I walked over to Union Square one day and looked up at my former apartment. The building now seemed to resemble the old photograph of Kandinsky's apartment. That evening I began to write a poem about the last evening Kandinsky had spent in Moscow before going into exile. I called the poem &quot;The View from Kandinsky's Window.&quot;</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="right"><a href="#contents">to list of contributors</a></p>    <hr />    <p align="left" class="TITLE2">2.23.06</p>    <p align="left"><em><a name="alexander" id="alexander"></a>chosen by</em> Charles Alexander<br />      <strong>Fleet of White</strong><br />      <em>from</em> <u>Defensive Rapture</u> (<em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>, 1993)</p>    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>    <p align="left">Almost a Cluster of Light</p>    <p align="left">There's so much I love of Barbara's work.
